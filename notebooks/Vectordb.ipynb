      "248.09210205078125 1459.0 2 Let me begin this preface with a confession of a few of my own biases. First, I believe that theory, and the models that flow from it, should provide us with the tools to understand, analyze and solve problems. The test of a model or theory then should not be based upon its elegance but upon its usefulness in problem solving. Second, there is little in corporate financial theory, in my view, that is new and revolutionary. The core principles of corporate finance are common sense ones, and have changed little over time. That should not be surprising. Corporate finance is only a few decades old and people have been running businesses for thousands of years, and it would be exceedingly presumptuous of us to believe that they were in the dark until corporate finance theorists came along and told them what to do. To be fair, it is true that corporate financial theory has made advances in taking common sense principles and providing them with structure, but these advances have been primarily on the details. The story line in corporate finance has remained remarkably consistent over time.\n",

      "245.0038299560547 1459.0 2 Talking about story lines allows me to set the first theme of this book. This book tells a story, which essentially summarizes the corporate finance view of the world. It classifies all decisions made by any business into three groups - decisions on where to invest the resources or funds that the business has raised, either internally or externally (the investment decision), decisions on where and how to raise funds to finance these investments (the financing decision) and decisions on how much and in what form to return funds back to the owners (the dividend decision). As I see it, the first principles of corporate finance can be summarized in figure 1, which also lays out a site map for the book. Every section of this book relates to some part of this picture, and each chapter is introduced with it, with emphasis on that portion that will be analyzed in that chapter. (Note the chapter numbers below each section). Put another way, there are no sections of this book that are not traceable to this framework.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "247.26324462890625 1459.0 3 As you look at the chapter outline for the book, you are probably wondering where the chapters on present value, option pricing and bond pricing are, as well as the chapters on short-term financial management, working capital and international finance.\n",

You should invest in either if and only if the returns from the investment exceed the hurdle rate from the investment; the fact the one is short term and the other is long term is irrelevant. The same thing can be said about international finance. Should the investment or financing principles be different just because a company is considering an investment in Thailand and the cash flows are in Thai Baht instead of in the United States and the cash flows are in dollars? I do not believe so, and separating the decisions, in my view, only leaves readers with that impression. Finally, most corporate finance books that have chapters on small firm management and private firm management use them to illustrate the differences between these firms and the more conventional large publicly traded firms used in the other chapters. While such differences exist, the commonalities between different types of firms vastly overwhelm the differences, providing a testimonial to the internal consistency of corporate finance.

      "245.93780517578125 1459.0 4 The way I have tried to bring this universality to life is by using four firms through the book to illustrate each concept; they include a large, publicly traded U.S. corporation (Disney), a small, emerging market company (Aracruz Celulose, a Brazilian paper and pulp company), a financial service firm (Deutsche Bank) and a small private business (Bookscape, an independent New York city book store). While the notion of using real companies to illustrate theory is neither novel nor revolutionary, there are, I believe, two key differences in the way they are used in this book. First, these companies are analyzed on every aspect of corporate finance introduced in this book, rather than used selectively in some chapters. Consequently, the reader can see for himself or herself the similarities and the differences in the way investment, financing and dividend principles are applied to four very different firms. Second, I do not consider this to be a book where applications are used to illustrate the theory. I think of it rather as a book where the theory is presented as a companion to the illustrations. In fact, reverting back to my earlier analogy of theory providing the tool box for understanding problems, this is a book where the problem solving takes center stage and the tools stay in the background.\n",

Defined broadly, everything that a business does fits under the rubric of corporate finance. It is, in fact, unfortunate that we even call the subject corporate finance, since it suggests to many observers a focus on how large corporations make financial decisions, and seems to exclude small and private businesses from its purview. A more appropriate title for this book would be Business Finance, since the basic principles remain the same, whether one looks at large, publicly traded firms or small privately run businesses.

The assets that the firm has already invested in are called assets-in-place, whereas those assets that the firm is expected to invest in the future are called growth assets.

It can raise funds from investors or financial institutions by promising investors a fixed claim (interest payments) on the cash flows generated by the assets, with a limited or no role in the day-to-day running of the business. We categorize this type of financing to be debt. Alternatively, it can offer a residual claim on the cash flows (i.e., investors can get what is left over after the interest payments have been made) and a much greater role in the operation of the business. We term this equity. Note that these definitions are general enough to cover both private firms, where debt may take the form of bank loans, and equity is the owner’s own money, as well as publicly traded companies, where the firm may issue bonds (to raise debt) and stock (to raise equity).\n",

These first principles provide the basis from which we will extract the numerous models and theories that comprise modern corporate finance, but they are also common sense principles. It is incredible conceit on our part to assume that until corporate finance was developed as a coherent discipline starting a few decades ago, that people who ran businesses ran them randomly with no principles to govern their thinking. Good businessmen through the ages have always recognized the importance of these first principles and adhered to them, albeit in intuitive ways. In fact, one of the ironies of recent times is that many managers at large and presumably sophisticated firms with access to the latest corporate finance technology have lost sight of these basic principles.\n",

The growth of corporate financial theory can be traced to its choice of a single objective and the development of models built around this objective. The objective in conventional corporate financial theory when making decisions is to maximize the value of your business or firm. Consequently, any decision (investment, financial, or dividend) that increases the value of a business is considered a ‘good’ one, whereas one that reduces firm value is considered a ‘poor’ one.

To the degree that this objective is flawed, however, it can be argued that the theory built on it is flawed as well. Many of the disagreements between corporate financial theorists and others (academics as well as practitioners) can be traced to fundamentally different views about the correct objective for a business. For instance, there are some critics of corporate finance who argue that firms should have multiple objectives where a variety of interests (stockholders, labor, customers) are met, while there are others who would have firms focus on what they view as simpler and more direct objectives such as market share or profitability.\n",

In the next chapter, we will consider these and other issues and compare firm value maximization to alternative objectives.\n",

The hurdle rate has to be set higher for riskier projects and has to reflect the financing mix used, i.e., the owner’s funds (equity) or borrowed money (debt). In chapter 3, we begin this process by defining risk and developing a procedure for measuring risk. In chapter 4, we go about converting this risk measure into a hurdle rate, i.e., a minimum acceptable rate of return, both for entire businesses and for individual investments.\n",

In chapter 5, we evaluate three alternative ways of measuring returns - conventional accounting earnings, cash flows and time-weighted cash flows (where we consider both how large the cash flows are and when they are anticipated to come in). In chapter 6, we consider some of the potential side-costs which might not be captured in any of these measures, including costs that may be created for existing investments by taking a new investment, and side-benefits, such as options to enter new markets and to expand product lines that may be embedded in new investments, and synergies, especially when the new investment is the acquisition of another firm.\n",

While we consider the existing mix of debt and equity and its implications for the minimum acceptable hurdle rate as part of the investment principle, we throw open the question of whether the existing mix is the right one in the financing principle section. While there might be regulatory and other real world constraints on the financing mix that a business can use, there is ample room for flexibility within these constraints.

While the tradeoff between the benefits and costs of borrowing are established in qualitative terms first, we also look at two quantitative approaches to arriving at the optimal mix in chapter 8. In the first approach, we examine the specific conditions under which the optimal financing mix is the one that minimizes the minimum acceptable hurdle rate.

Having outlined the optimal financing mix, we turn our attention to the type of financing a business should use, i.e., whether it should be long term or short term, whether the payments on the financing should be fixed or variable, and if variable, what it should be a function of. Using a basic proposition that a firm will minimize its risk from financing and maximize its capacity to use borrowed funds if it can match up the cash flows on the debt to the cash flows on the assets being financed, we design the perfect financing instrument for a firm.

As a consequence, every business that thrives reaches a stage in its life when the cash flows generated by existing investments is greater than the funds needed to take on good investments. At that point, this business has to figure out ways to return the excess cash to owners. In private businesses, this may just involve the owner withdrawing a portion of his or her funds from the business. In a publicly traded corporation, this will involve either dividends or the buying back of stock.

The link between these decisions and firm value can be made by recognizing that the value of a firm is the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted back at a rate that reflects both the riskiness of the projects of the firm and the financing mix used to finance them. Investors form expectations about future cash flows based upon observed current cash flows and expected future growth, which, in turn, depends upon the quality of the firm’s projects (its investment decisions) and the amount reinvested back into the business (its dividend decisions).

An understanding of corporate finance may help them make better decisions. 4. Corporate finance is fun. This may seem to be the tallest claim of all. After all, most people associate corporate finance with numbers, accounting statements and hardheaded analyses. While corporate finance is quantitative in its focus, there is a significant component of creative thinking involved in coming up with solutions to the financial problems businesses do encounter. It is no coincidence that financial markets remain the\n",

An objective specifies what a decision maker is trying to accomplish and by so doing, provides measures that can be used to choose between alternatives. In most firms, it is the managers of the firm, rather than the owners, who make the decisions about where to invest or how to raise funds for an investment. Thus, if stock price maximization is the objective, a manager choosing between two alternatives will choose the one that increases stock price more.

A theory developed around multiple objectives of equal weight will create quandaries when it comes to making decisions. To illustrate, assume that a firm chooses as its objectives maximizing market share and maximizing current earnings. If a project increases market share and current earnings, the firm will face no problems, but what if the project being analyzed increases market share while reducing current earnings? The firm should not invest in the project if the current earnings objective is considered, but it should invest in it based upon the market share objective. If objectives are prioritized, we are faced with the same stark choices as in the choice of a single objective. Should the top priority be the maximization of current earnings or should it be maximizing market share?

Consider, for instance, a firm that specifies its objective to be increasing growth in the long term. This is an ambiguous objective since it does not answer at least two questions. The first is growth in what variable - Is it in revenue, operating earnings, net income or earnings per share? The second is in the definition of the long term: Is it 3 years, 5 years or a longer\n",

How exactly is customer satisfaction defined and how is it to be measured?

Doing so may create significant costs for society that overwhelm any benefits arising from the objective.

Second, stockholders can sometimes be made wealthier by decisions that transfer wealth from those who have lent money to the firm.

If these costs are large, we can see society paying a high price for value maximization and the objective will have to be modified to allow for these costs. To be fair, however, this is a problem that is likely to persist in any system of private enterprise and is not peculiar to value maximization. The objective of value maximization may also face obstacles when there is separation of ownership and management, as there is in most large public corporations.

They require the assent of stockholders to be instituted. There are several types of anti-takeover amendments, all designed with the objective of reducing the likelihood of a hostile takeover. Consider, for instance, a super-majority amendment; to take over a firm that adopts this amendment, an acquirer has to acquire more than the 51% that would normally be required to gain control. Anti-takeover amendments do increase the bargaining power of managers when negotiating with acquirers and could work to the benefit of stockholders6, but only if managers act in the best interests of stockholders.\n",
