      " So if it's not a science and it's not an art, what the heck is it? I'll give you the word that I use to describe valuation, it's a craft. The analogy I would give that's closest to valuation is cooking. Think of how you master cooking, you can do what my daughter does. She watches cooking shows on TV all day long. She can't cook a lick, but she watches shows all day about how to cook. You don't learn cooking by watching TV shows. You don't learn cooking by reading cookbooks. You learn cooking by going into that room in your apartment or house called the kitchen. Remember that place? Because you've been taking takeout for so long, you haven't been in there for a while. And starting to cook. And the first time you cook, guess what happens? Disaster strikes. I still remember the first time I scrambled eggs. Nobody told me I was supposed to spray the damn pan. I finished scrambling the eggs. I'm really proud of myself. I tried to get the egg off the pan. Doesn't come off. Egg and pan went into the trash can. And I learned a very important lesson, though. Never again would I scramble eggs without spraying the pan. It doesn't come off. Egg and pan went into the trash can. I learned a very important lesson though. Never again would I scramble eggs without spraying the pan. You don't learn valuation by watching somebody talk about valuation. The next hour is wasted. You don't learn valuation by reading what other people write about valuation. Have you been reading my valuation books, what a waste of time. You learn valuation by doing. And the more different the companies you value, the more you will learn about valuation. I still surprise myself when I value a company about things in valuation I didn't know until I valued that company. And I value, I've things in valuation I didn't know till I value that company and I value I've been doing valuation for a long time but that to me is the most amazing part of valuation is how much more of this craft I still don't know so what I'd like to talk about is one aspect of this craft where I think I've had to work at it and I'd like you to take you on your journey on what I had to do to get where I am today. So I'm going to ask you my second question. So right after I ask is it an art or a science? Here's the second question I ask. If I ask you to categorize yourself as a person would you more naturally think of yourself as a number cruncher or would you more naturally think of yourself as a number cruncher or are you more naturally a storyteller? Think about it for just a moment. There's no right answer. Don't look at your neighbor. Don't look at me. Think about yourself. What comes more easily to you, number crunching or storytelling? Thought about it? You're saying, how would I know? You've known for a long time. thought about it you're saying how would I know you've known for a long time you know when I knew I knew when I was like 12 or 13 right after my first English literature class I was asked to read Moby Dick and I did I was a good kid I showed up in class ready for a discussion of whales and captains and 15 minutes into the session I noticed nobody was talking about fish so I put up my hands and said when are we we going to talk about the whale? The instructor said, there's no whale. I said, what? Did I read the wrong book? I distinctly remember a big fish all the way through the book. And she said, it's a metaphor. And I said, for what? And for the rest of the class, she talked about hidden meanings in the book. And I remember sitting there with my jaw dropped saying, really? That's what Herman Melville was thinking when he did that when he wrote that and when I came out of the class I came out with a singular conclusion I said never again am I going to subject myself to that kind of bullshit and the rest of my high school life was laid out for me I avoided the literature classes like the plague it was algebra one algebra two algebra three out of high school and these were the good old days when you could go to college and not take this core curriculum crap that they make you take today. You could take numbers class, numbers class, numbers class, numbers degree. And you went for a numbers job. In my typical valuation class, there are 300 MBAs in that class every semester. So when I asked this question, there are 300 MBAs in that class every semester. So when I asked this question, not surprisingly, about 180 of the people in the class put up their hands. They were more naturally number crunchers. Selection bias. But only 180 out of the 300. You say, what about the other 120? They were the people who actually loved that hidden meaning stuff. They're the poets. They're like my youngest son who writes poetry. He showed me his first poem. I don't think he's going to show me anymore. He said, what do you think, Dad? And I looked and said, Kiran, I like it, but aren't the words supposed to rhyme? Because that's the way I think about poetry, like nursery rhymes. If the last words don't rhyme, it's not poetry to me. He said, Dad, you're not a poet. And I said, you're right, Kiran. Keep writing poetry. Don't show any more to me. 180 people are number crunchers. The remaining 120 are storytellers. They're the ones who go literature one, literature two, literature three, go on to become history majors at Yale, and then discover after they come out that even Yale history majors don't get paid very much. So four years afterwards, they come back to business school. They're in my class. 180 number crunch. They don't sit together. For some reason, they segregate. And when I ask this question, of course, the number crunchers think that they own the high ground. They look at the story and say, what the hell are you doing in this class? It's a valuation class. It's all about numbers. And that's when I have to let them in. And what I think is the biggest hidden secret in valuation. Valuation can never be just about the numbers. If all you have is a collection of numbers in a spreadsheet, you don't have a valuation, you have a spreadsheet. So much of what we think about valuation now has become modeling. You notice this, it's all Excel modeling. There's very little valuation. You're just modeling things on a spreadsheet. A good valuation is a bridge between stories and numbers. So what are you talking about? If you show me a valuation, a discounted cash flow valuation, and I point to your revenues in year six, and there's six billion. So why are your revenues six billion in year six? You know what the answer I don't want to hear is? It's because I used to 35% growth rate for the first three years and 15% for the next three. That tells me absolutely nothing. I need to know what your story is about this company that will allow it to have a six billion dollar revenue in year six. Every number should have a story attached to it. And when you tell me a story about the company, every story should have a number attached to it. Like what? You talk about the great brand name this company has, this incredible management team. I'm going to ask you, where is it showing up in the numbers? That to me is a test of whether this is a valuation in just a collection of numbers or a collection of stories. The reason I think we need to do this more than ever before is we live in a world of specialization. If you're a number cruncher, guess what you do? You hang out with other number crunchers, you talk to other number crunchers, you live with other number crunchers, you forget that there are stories. And if you live with storytellers, all you do is tell each other stories. And left to our own devices, we wallow in our delusions. So let's start with the delusions that number crunchers have. And because I'm a number cruncher, I can list these delusions. And if you're a fellow number cruncher, tell me whether you share these delusions. The first is the delusion of precision. You know what that is? When number crunchers, if you feel uncertain, you know what makes you feel less uncertain? Add a decimal. That's what number crunches do. I feel uncertain, let me add a decimal. I feel much better now. The delusion of precision, if you make it look more precise, it's become more precise. The second is the delusion that because you're using numbers, you're unbiased. That's if you can't hide bias in a number. And third, the delusion of being in control. Think if you put a number on something, you're in control of it. Those are the delusions of number crunchers. If you hang out with other number crunchers, you forget these are delusions. Storytellers have their own set of delusions. And because I'm not a storyteller, if you're one, tell me whether I'm missing a delusion or mischaracterizing one. The first is the delusion that you really can't quantify this really big story. I've heard people say, well, brand name can't be quantified. The quality of management can't be quantified. It's such a big story. You also think being creative should bring its own reward. I told you such a big story. It should be worth at least $3 billion, right? And the third is you love using anecdotal evidence. Storytellers are like my mother-in-law. And I don't mean that as a compliment. She comes up with the most outrageous hypotheses. She doesn't call them hypotheses. She calls them facts. So I remember about seven or eight years ago, we're sitting at dinner and out of the blue, she says, the best car to drive in a snowstorm is an old Volkswagen Bug. I said, what? So how do you come up with this stuff, Judy? I should never ask her this question because she always tells me. She said, well, 25 years ago, she was in Lake Tahoe in the middle of a snowstorm driving a Volkswagen Bug. And she had to drive two miles from the grocery store back home. She made it back safe, but there were two other cars that ran off the road. So, I said, so? She said, that proves it, doesn't it? A Volkswagen Bug is the best car. It's amazing. Sample size of one. How much you can extrapolate from there. Left to your own devices, you're not even going to see these as delusions. And increasingly, we live in a world where we hang out with people who think like we do, act like we do, have the same training that we do. And of course, we all find each other completely reasonable. So here's what led me to the conclusion that I had to do things differently. I said I started teaching valuation in 1986. For the first six years that I taught valuation, I taught it like a number cruncher did. Which means, when in doubt, put up an equation. If you're in even more doubt, put up two equations. About six years into this process, I realized I had a problem. Here was my problem. I could value just about anything. I knew the mechanics, but I had no faith. Strange word to use, right? But let me explain what I mean by faith. When you value a company and you come up with a value higher than the price, why do you value companies? I don't know about you, but I don't lie awake at night wondering what's Facebook worth right now. It's not because you're intellectually curious. You value companies because if you come up with value higher than the price, you should be willing to buy, right? And to buy, what do you need? You need faith in your own valuations and faith that the market will correct. I found myself faithless. It's a bad place to be. You're teaching a class, you have no faith in your own valuations. I said, what am I missing? And what I realized I was missing was I was being completely mechanical. I knew exactly what the mechanics of evaluation were, but there were no stories that connected the numbers together. I had to teach myself how to tell stories. And the first time I did it was like scrambling eggs the very first time. It was a disaster. But 25 years later, I think I'm a little better at telling stories than I used to be when I first started. So what I'd like to do is take you on a journey of how I approach valuation because I have to be disciplined because left to my own devices, I'm going to open up that spreadsheet and start entering numbers because that's where my number crunching will lead me. So I almost have to force myself to slow down. And perhaps as I describe what I do, you can find your own devices for how to connect with your weaker side. You know what I mean by your weaker side? If you're a number cruncher, how you connect with your storytelling side. If you're a storyteller, how you connect with your number crunching side. You know what I mean by a weaker side? If you're a number cruncher, how you connect with your storytelling side. If you're a storyteller, how you connect with your number crunching side. So in my evaluation class, after I do the survey, I turn to each group and I tell them what my end mission or mission for this class is. So first I turn to the storytellers and I say, look, by the end of this class, 15 weeks, I hope you develop enough number crunching skills that you develop some discipline. Because left to telling stories, if you don't watch out, your storytelling is going to wander off into fantasy land. So hopefully you'll develop enough number crunching that you know when you're wandering into fantasy land. Discipline storytellers. Then I turned to the number cruncher. By the end of this class, I hope you develop an imagination. Imaginative number crunches or disciplined storytellers. Guess who I have more trouble with every single semester? Getting storytellers to develop discipline or number crunches let loose with their imagination? Number crunches. Number crunches every single with their imagination? Number crunches. Number crunches every single semester give me more trouble. You give me a hundred history majors, I can teach them enough valuation to value a company tomorrow. Valuation is not complicated. You give me a hundred engineers, I throw up my hands in the... I'll give up right here, right? And one of my problems with the CFA, it's one of the problems, one of the problems, giving a keynote to the CFA, being the only person in the room who doesn't have a CFA, with no desire to ever want a CFA or be near a CFA, is how mechanical so much of it has become. So, I still think the CFA is a great way to see the landscape in terms of mechanics, understanding what's out there. But walk away from the mechanics. The mechanics can really get in the way of doing valuation. Understand the mechanics, but make it work for you. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to lay out the five-step process I use to value a company. Why five steps? Because I'm a number cruncher. I have to think in linear. So if your story tells why five steps, jumble them up, use your own sequence. I need a sequence because without a sequence I am going to run to the spreadsheet. My first step when I sit down to value a company is I have to tell a story about the company. Notice what I said. My first step when I sit down to value a company is I have to tell a story about the company. Notice what I said. My first step is not to open the spreadsheet and start entering numbers, not to take a financial analysis and project out numbers, but to tell a story about the company. Of course, to tell that story, I need to understand what the company does, who its competition is, what the business is. So I need to understand the company enough that I can tell a story about the company. Let's face it. If you think Cisco makes vegetable oil, then the rest of your valuation, you're saying, does Cisco make vegetable oil? It doesn't. That's Crisco you're thinking about. But if you think Cisco makes vegetable oil, it doesn't matter how well you can do spreadsheets. Your valuation is going to be crappy. So the first step in the process is understanding the company enough so you can tell a story about the company. Second step in the process, and this to me is a critical step, is you've got to stop and make sure the story you've told is not a fairy tale, that it's possible. But you can't stop there. You have to ask, is it plausible? A tougher test than possible. Has anybody else done something like this before? And the third step, is it probable? What have you put in place for this to happen? So each step, you can actually see that you're getting more stringent about your requirements. Is it possible, plausible, probable? So that's the second step. Once you got through the first steps, two steps, you got a story that you think is not just possible, plausible and probable. You take each part of your story and you convert it into a number in your evaluation. This to me is the craft part. I view it as a challenge. When you give me a story, say where in my evaluation would I reflect that story? By the time I convert my story into numbers, step four, my evaluation does itself. The evaluation is just an output for my story. So in step four, you're done with the evaluation, right? But then there is a step 5, which is painful, but it's a step you have to go through anyway. Let me ask you a question. You tell a story about a company. You convert the story into numbers and numbers become a valuation. Do you like your own valuation? Of course you do. It's your company. You told the story, you've come up with a valuation. So when you show your valuation to other people, what do you want them to tell you? Amazing job. This is exactly how I value the company. And if you hang out with people who think just like you, that's exactly the reaction you will get. A free cash flow to the firm, that's the way you should value every company. Cost of capital, of course. Here's my suggestion. you should value every company. Cost of capital, of course. Here's my suggestion. Find people who think least like you. Present your valuation to them and be ready for some blowback. You're going to say, that's horrible. That's not the way I think about valuation. Don't get defensive. Listen. I call this the feedback loop because that's the way you tell a better story. You take your story and say, what can I change? What can I improve about the story? And for that to happen, you've got to listen to what people disagree with you on the most. Five-step process. And if you can follow that process, you will have a value that's not just numbers, but a story connected to numbers. Sounds abstract, right? So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to use two companies to illustrate this process. I could use any of the companies I value, but I'll take these two companies because I'm sure you're familiar with both. The first company I'm going to value is Uber in June of 2014. I just took an Uber from Dubendorf over here. So Uber is obviously here. You know what it does. from Dubendorf over here. So Uber is obviously here. You know what it does. Latest pricing for the company was about $70 billion. So clearly people think it's worth a lot. Maybe it's worth less than it was three months ago, but it's still $50, $60, $70 billion. So the first company I'm going to value is Uber in June of 2014. You're saying, why the June of 2014? Because I valued Uber every year since 2014. And guess what? My story has changed because the world has changed. And as the story changed, my values changed. So I'll take you back to June of 2014 and show you the story I told and how that story became numbers into my valuation and final valuation. The other company I'm going to use is Ferrari in October of 2015 at the time of the initial public offering. Ferrari has been around a long time, since 1948. But Enzo Ferrari in the 1960s got into a little bit of financial trouble, or a lot of financial trouble, had to sell off 90% of Ferrari to Fiat. And it stayed as part of Fiat Chrysler till 2015. So in October of 2015, they went public. And at the time they filed their prospectus, I chose to value Ferrari. So I'll take you through the process of how I value Ferrari, again, starting with the story, ending the valuation. And because you should be familiar with both companies, here's what I'd encourage you to do. As I tell my story, rather than bitch and moan about what you don't like about my story. Rather than bitch and mourn about what you don't like about my story. Remember, it's my story. I can tell whatever story I want. This is my valuation of Uber and Ferrari. You don't like it? Tell your own story. And I'll give you the tools to convert your story into valuation. That's the essence of valuation. Rather than fight about revenue growth rates, which is such an arid, abstract discussion. We should be talking about what's your story about this company? What's my story? Because different stories can lead to different valuations. Ready? Let's get started. The first step in valuation before you sit down to value companies, you got to understand what your company does. You got to understand the business it's in. You got to figure out what its company does. You've got to understand the business it's in. You've got to figure out what its competitors do. You've got to understand why people buy stuff from the company, why people work for the company. And one of the problems with how things have evolved over the last 30 years is we have access to so much more data than we did 30 years ago. That when I ask you to do research in a company, what's your first instinct? Go to the computer, collect data, and start putting it into spreadsheets. That's useful. You can look at the historical revenue growth, the historical margins, etc. But don't stop there. To really understand a company, you've got to talk to people. Like whom? Like the customers of the company. Like the employees. Without it, you really don't get a sense of the company. So I'll take you back to June of 2014 and tell you a story about how I got interested in Uber. June 3rd, I think, 2014, I open up the Wall Street Journal and there's a little news story. It says venture capitalists had just invested in this company called Uber and I'd never heard of Uber before June of 2014 because I live underground in New York City. I take the subway, I don't take cars, service anywhere, I don't take cabs. It's a venture capitalist that priced the company at $17 billion. What's a word that I just used to say? Venture capitalist at price. What's a word that I did not use? Venture capitalists never value companies. They price them. That's an entirely different discussion. Price and value are not interchangeable. Price comes from a very different process than value does. If you believe in efficient markets, of course, the two will converge. But there's a pricing problem. So venture capitalists price the company at $17 billion. I was surprised. I'd never heard of the company. Let me take that back. I'd seen the word Uber on my credit card statements in the three months leading into June of 2014. Because it turned out that my second son was going to college in North Carolina, was using Uber and using my credit card. But I thought he was taking German language classes, to be quite honest. The umlaut and the U should have kind of given it away, right? So I said, okay, let me call him and find out what this Uber company is all about. Maybe it's not a German language class, because I can't imagine a German language company being worth 17 billion. So I called my son, and he was sleeping. It's 11.30 in the morning. You kept college student hours, which means you go to bed at 6 o'clock in the morning. You wake up at 2 in the afternoon. God only knows what. So he was still sleeping. It's 11.30 in the morning. You kept college student hours, which means you go to bed at 6 o'clock in the morning. You wake up at 2 in the afternoon. God only knows what. So he was still sleeping. So he wouldn't pick up the phone. So I called my niece, who was working in Chicago. So she had to be awake. But she was in a terrible mood. She says, what do you want? There's no way to talk to your uncle. He's not called you in a few weeks. So I said, no. If you're into this Uber, she said, it's a ride-sharing company. I said, what the heck is a ride-sharing company? She said, I don't have the time to talk to you. Why don't you just download the app and find out for yourself? Need to talk to her mother about this behavior. She hangs up the phone. I said, okay, download the app. Put in my phone, hit the app. Magical things start to happen on my phone. A GPS opens up and I see a car trying to drive towards me. It's New York City. You don't drive towards me. You try to drive towards me. A lot of one-way streets. And I can see a guy called George sitting in the front seat. This has never happened to me with a yellow cab. So fascinated, I watch. Fifteen minutes later, he pulls up in front of 44 West 4th Street, which is where NYU is. I run out to the car and say, hi, George. He says, where do you want to go? He says, nowhere. Can you drive me around for about 35 minutes? I have some questions to ask you. I thought for a moment that I was a serial killer. But he said, I can take you. Just get in the back. So I get in the back and I start asking questions. Questions like, is this an Uber car you're driving? He said, no, this is my car. I said, are you an Uber employee? No, I'm an independent contractor. I said, why do you do this? He said, you know what? I have a regular job. I don't make enough money on it. I already own my car. I pay insurance on it. And this is a way for me to make a second income on the car. I said, that's interesting. Why do you need Uber? He said, in New York City, you can't pick up people on the street. It's against the law. Uber connects me with customers. I said, okay. I can see why you drive the car. I can see why you need Uber. 35 minutes later, he drops me off back in my office and I offered to pay him. He should have just taken the money. He said, you don't have to pay me. I said, it's free. I said, no, it's not free. He said, when you downloaded the app, they ask you for a credit card number. I said, yes. He said, they'll charge you. I said, how do you get paid? He said, they'll send me 80% of whatever your fare is. I said, why 80%? He said, I don't know. That's what they all do. Now I could see why Uber did what they did. They don't own the cars. They don't hire the drivers for being matchmakers. That's all they are. They get to keep 20% of the fare. So I could understand why this guy drove for Uber. I could see why Uber did what they did. The one missing piece. Why do people like my son like Uber? See, my son, I can't even imagine him calling a regular cab on the street. It's beyond his comprehension, going out on the street, waving his hands. So I called him. This time at a civilized hour, I knew he could not be asleep, like 3.30 in the afternoon. So I put him on the defensive right away. It's a good strategy if you have kids. I said, Brendan, I noticed you've been using my credit card to back up your ride sharing. I acted like I knew Uber was a ride sharing company. I said, you already own a car in North Carolina. What the heck are you doing taking Uber all over the place? He said, Dad, on Friday nights and Saturday nights, I really like Uber. Now, as a parent, there are no follow-up questions you want to ask here because you're afraid of what the answers might be. But I kind of got it. I said, okay. I said, what do you like about Uber? He said, I can call the car from the bar. Okay, that's good. I said, but these cars must be more expensive than a cab, right? He said, no, no, they're cheaper than a cab. I said, really? You must wait forever, no, they're cheaper than a cab. I said, really? You must wait forever, right? They come quicker than a cab. I said, okay, they're cheaper than a cab. They come quicker than a cab. I said, these cars must be filthy, right? He said, no, they're cleaner than a cab. That's when I knew cab service was destined for doom. They're cheaper, they're faster, they're cleaner. Over time, they're going to take over. The only question I'd left was, what's so special about Uber? Why can't I go into my basement and start a matchmaking service? And I could think of three reasons why it wouldn't work. One was $3 billion. That's how much a venture capitalist is given Uber. They forgot to send me the $3 billion. The second is, there is a networking benefit in this business. It's a word we use loosely, but if you're a ride-sharing company, as you get bigger, it actually gets easier to get bigger. That's what a networking benefit is. And here's why it happens. If you're a driver signing up for a ride-sharing company, guess where you want to go? You want to go to the biggest ride-sharing company because that's where the customers are. And if you're a customer, guess which ride-sharing app you want to go. You want to go to the biggest ride-sharing company because that's where the customers are. And if you're a customer, guess which ride-sharing app you want to use. You want to use the ride-sharing app of not the smallest startup, but the company that's around the most because there are more cars around. So Uber has $3 billion. They've got this networking benefit because they got started earlier than I did. And the third potential benefit I could think of is Uber does collect data about you. So if you use Uber, they know more about you than you want them to know. They know where you left, when you left, who you met. They pretty much are keeping tabs on you. And they use it in creative ways. Like what? You heard of Uber surge pricing, right? I don't know whether it's true in Zurich, but in much of the world, the fare you pay on Uber will depend on the time of the day you take an Uber and where you take the Uber from, because they adjust the price to demand and supply, a very sensible way to ration. They're using the data. In fact, in the US, they actually have coded in by zip code what the income level of each zip code is. Which means if you call for an Uber from a high income zip code, your fare is actually different. I tell my kids if they're in a high income zip code, walk three blocks away to a lower income. Don't get mugged, but call from there because your fare will be about 25% lower. So when I was done with, if you can even call, you're saying, why didn't you look at the financials? Why are you wasting your time? Why didn't I look at the financials? Uber is a private company. There are no financials to look at, even if I'd wanted to. But even if I'd been able to look at the financials, what would I have learned by looking at the financials? There's nothing there. It's a young company. It's a startup. The financials are going to tell you very little about a company if it's that young. This is exactly the kind of research I need to do to understand the company. So when I was done, I drew a picture. And I tried to do this almost every company I value. Picture of what makes this company tick. What makes it succeed, what it does well, what it does badly, why it might acquire more market share firms compared to why less. So this was my Uber picture based on that research, if you can call it research, that I did of asking people questions about the company. So at this stage, I kind of understood what Uber did as a company. I kind of understood the ride-sharing company. Kind of is about all I aspire to do. I don't want to be an expert in ride-sharing. I have far better things to do with my life. But I knew enough about this business that I could get started. So that's, I call this surveying the landscape, understanding the business you're in, understanding the company. Let me move to Ferrari, October of 2015. What business is Ferrari in? Loosely speaking, the automobile business, and that's really bad news. You know why? Every year I go through this perverse exercise of listing the 10 worst businesses in the world to be in. And if you work for a company, hope and pray you're not one of these 10. I'll give away some clues. You don't want to be in the airline business ever. You know the other business that consistently shows up in the 10 worst businesses? The automobile business. You say, what's so bad about the automobile business? Let me nail the coffin shut on the automobile business. Here are the things I don so bad about the automobile business? Let me nail the coffin shut on the automobile business. Here are the things I don't like about the business. Leading into 2015, in the 10 years prior, the collective revenue growth that all automobile companies globally, in every single market put together, was only 5.6%. And half that growth came from? Thank you, China. point six percent and half that growth came from thank you China I tell my MBA is whenever somebody asks you a question to which you don't know the answer just say China notice how well it works for almost any question why are interest rates low China why interest rates high China just make it sound profound like you thought through this it usually works pretty well as I answer to pretty much every question. You think, so what? If China slows down, that 5.6% growth is very quickly going to become 4% growth. So you've got low revenue growth, first nail in the coffin. Second, this is a business where companies make abysmal operating margins. One third of all automobile companies lost money in 2014 and it wasn't a recession yet. The median operating margin, I'm not talking net profit margin, I'm climbing the income statement. The median operating margin for an automobile company is 4.4%. Low revenue growth, bad margins. Let's nail the coffin shut. Usually, if you're a company with low revenue growth. One of the few bonuses you get is you don't have to invest much in CapEx. Why? Because you're not growing very fast. Unfortunately for automobile companies, they've had to invest a great deal of money in the 10 years leading into 2015, not in assembly plants, but in R&D. You know why? If you get into a new car, notice it's more computer than car. That's what the R&D has been know why? If you get into a new car, notice it's more computer than car. That's what the R&D has been. It's investing in that computerization process. If you have low revenue growth, bad margins, and lots of reinvestment, you know exactly what's going to happen. The kind of returns you're going to generate as a business are going to reflect it. And in 9 of the 10 years leading into 2015, automobile companies have earned a return on capital less than their cost of capital. This is a bad business. So if you gave me a Volkswagen to value, my best case scenario is still going to look like a horror story. You give me GM or Ford, there's no good ending to the story. But luckily, in the case of Ferrari, Ferrari is not just another automobile company. I'm not even sure it's an automobile, to be quite honest. It's a very impractical car. There's one guy in my town who owns a Ferrari. I've never seen him drive it. It's kept in an extra armored garage with two guys standing in front of it guarding the garage. You can break into this guy's house multiple times every day. You wouldn't even notice, but his car is well protected. The rumor is that once every year he takes a car out of the garage, he drives it around town and back into the garage and parks it for the next year. And who can blame the guy? Where are you going to drive your Ferrari? Can you imagine grocery shopping in your Ferrari? You go and park your car, you go into the grocery store, you come out, there's $15,000 worth of damage on the car. How about driving carpool in a Ferrari? That must be fun. You've got to pick up four kids in one seat. You've got to stack them up. So why does this guy pay all this money to own a car he never drives? Why do people own Ferraris? Does anybody here own a Ferrari? You own a Ferrari? No, once the chairman, Montezemolo, said that they don't sell cars but dreams. Very exclusive dreams. If everybody had the same dream, you wouldn't buy the dream. They price the dream enough. You want to be part of an exclusive club. That's the reality. That's why you buy a Ferrari. In fact, to show you how exclusive it is, let me tell you a little bit about Ferrari. In 2014, the entire year, all over the globe, Ferrari sold 7,255 cars. Think about it. That's how many cars Volkswagen probably rejects on its assembly line every day. 7,255 cars, entire globe. That's the bad news. They didn't sell very many cars. But here's the good news. Their operating margin is 18.2%. What is the median margin for an automobile company to remember? It's about 4.46%. Their operating margin is four times higher. Why? Because they charge sky-high prices, and they spend almost nothing on traditional advertising. Almost all of their ad spending is on sponsorship of the races that they do. Have you ever seen a Ferrari ad that says, come on in 10% off? They don't want the kind of people who'd come in with 10% off. In fact, I live in a part of the country, La Jolla, where I run by a Ferrari dealership every morning on my job. And I've been trying to steal my courage up to go into the dealership because I'm afraid. I'm afraid they'll ask me for references. Like, how many billionaires do you know? None? Get out of here. This is an exclusive club. They're not going to let anybody walk off the street. And here's the final bonus for being an exclusive club. Usually when you sell a luxury good, your revenues tend to be very volatile, depending on how well or badly the economy is doing. Gucci, Tiffany, you look at the economy and you basically see the revenue swing around. Ferrari has sold about 7,200 cars every year for the 10 years leading to 2015, including 2009, the year after the great crisis. You say, how come? If you ask a Ferrari owner, how's the economy doing? You know what their response is? What's an economy that you talk about? To them, bad years, I'm worth only $4 billion. I used to be worth $6 billion. They're not exactly cutting coupons. You know why this is going to show up, right? When I do my costly capital for Ferrari, I'm going to reflect the fact that they're an exclusive cup. They sell to people. They're so exclusive that they, in a sense, have less risk than somebody who's less exclusive. But it goes with the story. So at this stage, I kind of knew enough about Ferrari to tell a story. So now comes the part where I have to tell a story. And here I have to remind myself that I'm not a novelist. I'm telling a business story. You're saying, so what? Two suggestions if you ever have to tell a business story. So if you're a startup founder, first, keep it simple. As opposed to what? I remember about 10 years ago, my oldest son, the same one I took to see the Picasso exhibit, gives me a book to read. He says, Dad, you've got to read the series. It's amazing. The book is about a thousand pages thick. I look at the book. It says Game of Thrones. Right below it says George R. R. Martin. I say, okay, I'll try it because I take my kids' book suggestions very seriously. Two weeks later, I call my son and said, Ryan, I'm too old for this. I'm halfway through the book. They're like hundreds of characters. They walk on, they walk off. They die, they come back to life. They're in this empire, they're in that empire. I've completely lost control of the story. I give up. So here's my suggestion. You're telling a business story, don't make it Game of Thrones. You don't have seven seasons and 70 episodes to tell your story. You have like 15 minutes. So keep it simple. Keep it focused. What's the end game for every business? Tell me how you expect to make money. I don't expect you to make money next year, but tell me what your plans are. You'd be amazed at how many founder pitches I've sat through. We're about 15 minutes in. I stop the guy and say, the guy is so excited. I have this tremendous app. Look at how many people are downloading it. And finally, he stops and says, how do you plan to make money? He says, I have to make money? Let me go back to how great the app is and how many people. No, you have to tell me how you eventually expect to make money. Is it on a subscription model? Is it from advertising? So keep it simple. Keep it focused. So I'm going to take those pieces of advice and show you the stories, at least tell you the stories I told for these companies at the time that I valued them. So June of 2014, after doing that basic research in Uber, here's the story I told about Uber. Remember what I told you. As I tell the story, you say, that's wrong. I would have told a different story. This is my story. You can tell your own story. Here's the story I told about Uber. And every word in the story is going to matter in my evaluation. I described Uber as an urban car service company. Already, I'm trying to tell you where I think Uber will succeed, right? Urban basically means cities and big towns. And I see its primary business as car service. It's an urban car service company. That will attract new users into this business. Like whom? Like my son. Somebody who would never have taken a traditional cab is going to come into the business. With local networking benefits. I already talked about what networking benefits are. Uber becomes the largest ride-sharing company in New York. There's going to be a tipping point where it'll essentially end up dominating the market. You think, what's a local doing in there? Let's assume that Uber does become the dominant ride-sharing company in New York, but I fly to Chicago. I don't care who the largest ride-sharing company in New York is. I care about the largest ride-sharing company in Chicago. So in my care about the largest ride-sharing company in Chicago. So in my story, here's what can happen. Uber can end up dominating New York. Lyft can end up dominating Chicago. Grab taxi can end up dominating Kuala Lumpur. Ola can end up dominating Mumbai. And Didi Chukchin can end up dominating Beijing. You think, so what? It's going to have consequences for what kind of market share I can give the company in steady state. And I'm going to assume that they can keep doing what they're doing in terms of that 80-20 mix. It's completely arbitrary. Why not 85-15 like Grab Taxi? So basically, I'm going to assume they can keep doing what they're doing and that they can continue to not own the cars and not hire the drivers. There's my Uber story. And every part of that story is going to become a number in my valuation. Now let me show you my Ferrari story. My Ferrari story is that they're going to stay an exclusive club. As opposed to what? As opposed to pulling off a Maserati. Maserati in 2008 looked a lot like Ferrari in 2015. It sold about 7,000 cars, very exclusive club, but they had bigger ambitions. They wanted to grow faster. So you know what they did in 2009? They introduced a cheap Maserati. Don't get too excited. It's not that cheap. Called the Ghibli. $120,000 Maserati. And they succeeded in terms of growing faster. But guess what? They had to give up as a result. Their margins were 18% dropped to 14%. And instead of selling to people who are so rich, he said, what's an economy? They were selling to people who are rich, who felt what the economy was doing. There's a trade-off here. So in my story, I'm going to assume that Ferrari stays an exclusive club and later ask, what if I'd assume that Ferrari pulls a Maserati? So Ferrari is going to stay an exclusive club with all its pluses and minuses. The pluses are it can maintain high margins and have a low cost of capital. The minus is that I can't give them 10% revenue growth, not because they can't grow at 10%, but if they did, they would not be an exclusive club and I can't give them the good stuff. So you're going to see low revenue growth, high margins, low cost of capital reflecting the exclusive club. I've got my story going. I've got to stop and ask the question, is this story a fairy tale? So the first test is a very simple test. Am I telling you an impossible story? You'd be amazed at how many valuations I see where I look through the valuation that this just cannot happen. It's impossible. So if you pass that test, and I'm going to ask, is this plausible? And then if you pass the test, is it probable? I'll give you a very simple example of the difference between possible, plausible, and probable that came. I was in Latin America a month ago for CFA Brazil, CFA Peru, and CFA Chile. So I started in Brazil. So I asked a question, is it possible that Brazil will win the World Cup? What do you think the answer was in that audience? Of course. I said, is it plausible that they'll win the World Cup? And Brazil's been playing really good. It's plausible. Then I said, it's probable. And they said, you know what? Neymar keeps playing well. So in a sense, possible, they clearly, everybody said it's clearly possible. Then I said, plausible? No, not plausible, clearly. Probable, you have to start bringing pieces into place for probable to work. So I leave Brazil and I fly to Santiago, Chile. And I didn't know what had happened the previous week. So I asked this question without knowing what had happened. So I said, is it possible that Chile could win the World Cup? And people started crying. Seriously. And the reason was the previous week Chile had actually got knocked out of World Cup contention because they'd actually lost two days prior to mine. They thought I was picking at scabs. I really didn't know. So they said it's not possible because it's not going to be there. You can't win the World Cup if you haven't qualified. It's impossible. So if I told you this elaborate story about Chile winning the next World Cup, it's not going to happen. Nice fairy tale. We have to start thinking about business stories through those same lens. Is it possible? Is it plausible? Is it probable? And the best way I can have of illustrating that concept is to give you examples of impossible stories, implausible stories, and improbable stories. Let's start with impossible stories. About a year ago, I was looking at, you know what fairness opinions are? They're like fig leaves that investment banks give companies overpaid saying, you're okay, we gave you a fig leaf. They're kind pointless exercise is a number crunching to justify a number that cannot be justified. So usually I cut bankers slack when it comes to fairness opinions, knowing there's nothing fair or even opinion about a fairness opinion. So this wasn't a Tesla-SolarCity deal. For those of you who know, this was a tremendously conflicted deal for a simple reason. Who's the largest shareholder in Tesla? Elon Musk. Who's the largest shareholder in Tesla? Elon Musk. Who's the largest shareholder in SolarCity? Elon Musk. You know who the CEO of SolarCity was? Elon Musk's cousin. So when Tesla bought SolarCity, they knew they were buying a heap of legal trouble. So they decided to insulate themselves and the way they decided to insulate themselves was by hiring two different investment bankers and paying them a lot of money to buy insulation. So they hired Lazard. So basically, SolarCity hired Lazard. And Tesla hired Evercore, which is this boutique investment bank in New York. So they do the valuations. It becomes part of a filing with the SEC. And I was able to get my hands on the public filing. So I take a look at the filing to see how they valued, because they had to justify this merger. I was willing to cut them a lot of slack on what they did. I was looking at how Evercore valued Tesla. They had done a D.C.F. That's how they described it. I'll stick with their own terminology. They had done a discounted cash flow valuation. Here's where they got the cash flows. They asked the Tesla board of directors to give them the cash flows. They said, where did the Tesla Board of Directors get it from? They got it from Goldman Sachs Equity Research. So the tangled web gets more tangled. Goldman Sachs was their local investment banker. So basically, they got the cash flows for the next five years from the Tesla board. I said, okay. Of course, after five years, the spreadsheet goes blank. They said, we can't have blank numbers. So after five years, they said, okay, we're going to assume a perpetuity and do a terminal value. This is their reading out of the same script you all did, right, for the CFA? So after the fifth year, they decided to put in a 6% growth rate forever in calculating the terminal value. My first response is, what currency are you guys doing the valuation in? Maybe it's Argentine pesos and forgot to tell me. Turned out they were doing a valuation in U.S. dollars. That's an impossible valuation. Think of what? If I let Tesla grow at 6% a year forever in dollar terms, in an economy growing at 2% or 2.5% a year, what's going to happen to Tesla? In about 25 years, 30 years, it's going to become the US economy. Okay, globalization. Let's keep going. 15 years later, it'll be the global economy. I can't even visualize a world that's all Tesla all the time. You'd have to live in your Tesla, eat your Tesla, get health care from your Tesla. The only way I can justify it, maybe SpaceX meets Tesla and the next thing you know, Tesla is flying off into space. Now, maybe you're selling to them. It's an impossible valuation. Here's another example of an impossible valuation. Every student in my class has to pick a company to value. So, about two years ago, no, last year actually, one of my students picks Netflix to value. Fascinating company, fun company to value, but a company where it's really difficult to get the intrinsic value above the price because it's so richly priced. Stock was trading at like 120, he comes back with $500 per share as his value. And I said, what did he do? So I look at his revenue, and in year 10, he has $600 billion, $600 billion in revenues for Netflix. So I called him in. This was like a mid-semester feedback. So I called him in and said, do you have Netflix? He said, yes. I said, how much do you pay per year? He pulled out his calculator that seemed to be attached to his hip, about $100 a year. So let me ask you a follow-up question. How many subscribers would Netflix need to have in your tent to get to $600 billion in revenue? Again, he pulls out his calculator. He said, you don't need a damn calculator. $600 billion divided by 100 is 6 billion subscribers. He says, I don't see where this is going. He said, hang in there. I have a few more questions for you. I said, what's the population of the world. He says, I don't see where this is going. He says, hang in there, I have a few more questions for you. I said, what's the population of the world? He says, I don't know, I have to go check Wikipedia. I said, let me save you the trouble, it's about 7 billion. Is there something you need to tell me? Maybe there's something I missed. Maybe there's a law that's been passed that says every man, woman, and child and pet on the face of the earth has to have their own Netflix account, in which case your $600 billion is completely reasonable. He says, don't be absurd. I said, I'm not the one who estimated $600 billion revenue. You did. He said, I was just using last year's number. I said, what? He said, I took last year's user growth and I plugged it in for the next 10 years. The power of compounding. Amazing what it can do to you. That's an impossible valuation. You can believe that Netflix is undervalued, but it cannot be because you believe that they can make a $600 billion revenue. Impossible valuations. Let me give you an example of an implausible valuation. One of my students actually works for the NFL. You know what the NFL is? National Football League, perhaps the best run, most lucrative sporting league in the world. He works for the NFL and he valued an NFL team and he sent it to me for some feedback. So he projected out revenue growth and cash flows, but I looked to see that they own their own stadium. So I was expecting some reinvestment back in the stadium. He was investing nothing. So I called him and I said, no, I see your revenue growth. It seems reasonable. Your margins look okay. Your TV contract revenues look okay. How come you're not spending any money on your stadium? And he said, that's easy to explain. Every time we need to spruce up the stadium, here's what we do. We go to the city and we threaten them. With what? We'll leave it. We're moving to San Diego. We're moving to Las Vegas. And they pick up the cost. I said, now I get it. Implausible valuations. If you can give me a really good reason why you have the combination that you do, I can let it go. So implausible can happen, but you better have a really good reason why it's happening. Which brings me to improbable valuations. When I look at DCFs, and I look at a lot of them, so when I do in my class, 300 DCFs come in mid-semester for me for feedback. People expect me to do miracles. Things like, look at the revenue growth number and say, your revenue growth for this company should be 22.3%, not 23.5. I don't know what they think I do. I'm some idiot savant who can look at, oh, that's not the right revenue growth. All I do when I get a spreadsheet, and I do this with any valuation, is I check it for internal consistency. Let me explain. I have what I call my valuation triangle. And here are the three sides of the triangle. On one side, you have growth. On the second side, you have reinvestment. The third side, you have risk. If I see high growth in your valuation, what should I expect to see in the reinvestment side? High reinvestment or low reinvestment? I should see high reinvestment. And when I look at the risk, usually high risk. High, high, high makes sense. Low, low, low makes sense. High, low, low. usually high risk. High, high, high makes sense. Low, low, low makes sense. High, low, low. I'm going to push back. So how come your growth is so high and you have so little reinvestment? And perhaps you have a really good explanation. I'll give you an example. Somebody was valueing a toll road company last year and he had this high revenue growth, almost no reinvestment and almost no risk. So I said, how come? And he explained to me and I was okay with it. And here's what he said. This toll road company had spent the previous 15 years building the toll roads. They were just done. They were just opening the toll roads, which meant that they didn't have to reinvest very much because they already had done the reinvestment of the infrastructure. And because it was the only toll road connecting the airport to the city, in a sense, it had a captive market and the government had kept it captive. I get it. So you have high revenue growth, low reinvestment, low risk. In this company, given what you told me, I'm okay with it. So improbable valuations, again, my job is to push and for you to explain to me why that inconsistency is okay. Because if you don't have a good reason, then I'm going to say maybe you're missing something. It's amazing how many valuations you see where analysts are at war with themselves. It's almost like they have three personalities. There's a growth guy, there's a reinvestment guy, and there's a risk guy. It's all the same guy, but it's almost like you drink different liquors before you do each one. Growth, you drink the optimist liquor. Let's all the same guy, but it's almost like you drink different liquors before you do each one. Growth, you drink the Optimus Liquor. Maybe it's the highest number I can. Reinvestment, you forget entirely about reinvestment. Maybe you're drunk enough that you forgot about net capex and working capital. And when you get to risk, it's a different personality. Again, low risk. So if you have that inconsistency, it's your job to tell me why. have that inconsistency. It's your job to tell me why. So I took my Uber story and checked to see whether it was probable, possible, plausible, or probable. What's the story I'm describing Uber as an urban car service company, right? And in 2014, it was already succeeding as an urban car service company. So I was on pretty solid ground. I assumed it could attract new users into the market. So I was on pretty solid ground. I assumed it could attract new users into the market. I could give you my son as evidence, but that's acting like my mother-in-law. It's anecdotal evidence. So I'll give you something more substantial. The part of the world where ride-sharing has its deepest roots is the Bay Area. San Francisco, around there. You know that the car service market in the Bay Area is 300% of what it was in 2008? What does that tell you? There are people taking car service who used to take mass transit. There are people taking car service used to drive their own cars. It's changed the way people transport themselves in the Bay Area. We know it changes the way people behave. So I feel again on pretty solid ground assuming it attracts new users. I wasn't willing in June of 2014 to go far enough to say that Uber could become a replacement for your second car because that makes the market even bigger, right? So instead of buying that second car, you're going to take Uber instead. So I felt pretty okay with my Uber story just as I did with the Ferrari story because I'm just assuming they can continue to do what they did. If I'd given a shift in the Ferrari story, then I'd have to ask the question, can they pull off a Maserati? Is this even feasible? Is it possible? Is it plausible? Is it probable? Now, just as a cautionary note, I've got to tell you that sometimes you listen to a story and it sounds so good, you want it to be true. And when you want something to be true, it's amazing how you will hold back on asking questions. I'll give you an example. Let's assume you quit your jobs. You're bored with these spreadsheets and CFA stuff. You decide to become a movie producer and you move to Hollywood. So you hang out at the Beverly Hills Hilton. And I'm going to come and pitch a story to you and you tell me whether the story sounds good enough that you want to make a movie out of it. It's about a 19-year-old who drops out of Stanford. Who does that? You know what the acceptance rate in Stanford was last year? It's like minus 3%. It's the most selective school in the entire world. This person got in and dropped out. And let's make it interesting. Rather than another male geek dropping out and starting a technology company, this is a 19-year-old woman who drops out of Stanford and starts a blood testing company. And she's going to change the way blood testing is done. How? Instead of taking two buckets of your blood, which is what traditional blood testing does, and taking six weeks to tell you what's wrong with you, she's going to take two drops of your blood and 45 minutes later email you the results for 32 different tests in your blood. It's going to cost you $50, $1,500. But do you want the story to be true, right? I wish i'd made up the story because this is actually a true story where did i go with this bit i'm sorry there you go the 19 year old was called elizabeth holmes she dropped out of stanford and she started theranos there's a nanotainer that sounds fancy already two drops of blood in the nanotainer. That sounds fancy already. Two drops of blood in the nanotainer. 32 different tests. Great sounding story. And you're not the only ones who have liked that story. Venture capitalists piled on. In fact, by the start of 2015, Theranos was valued at more than $9 billion. Some of the biggest name VCs were on the list. And it wasn't just VCs who were getting excited. The Cleveland Clinic, which is one of America's leading healthcare organizations, said they were going to partner with Theranos. Walgreens, one of the biggest pharmacies in the U.S., said they were going to start a Theranos lab. So this was almost a collective buy-in that Theranos was going to succeed. So in the middle of 2015, it asked me, do you think Theranos was going to succeed. So in the middle of 2015, you'd ask me, do you think Theranos has some substance? My answer is, I don't know much about the company. It's a private company, but given the kind of VCs invested in it, and given that the Cleveland Clinic and Walgreens are part of it, there must be something there. But let me ask you a question. You're an investor in a blood testing company. It's not a social media company. It's not an app company. It's a blood testing company. I would assume the first question you'd probably ask is, does this test work, right? Sounds like a fundamental question. I'd assume somebody would ask that question. And I turned out to be wrong because the Wall Street Journal reported decides in October of 2015 to ask that question. Because on the website for the company, they said 32 different tests in the blood 45 minutes later. So he went to the FDA and he said, has Theranos been approved for all these tests? And the FDA said, no, we've approved them for one of the 32. So what about the other 31? So the tests are a little noisy. What's a noisy blood test? I'll give you the example of a noisy blood test. It's a poor test, but take it for what it's worth. You get tested for leukemia. The test comes back and it says, you know what? You might have leukemia, or you might not. Can't tell, but if something bad happens, come back. It's not exactly a feature you look for i want a bloody i want a noisy blood test but the amazing thing was you know all these people had piled into the company and nobody nobody had asked that question you're saying no that's crazy i'll tell you something though it's easy to pass judgment from the outside but if you are an investor in that room, and Elizabeth Holmes was at that time one of the leading lights in this business, and she got up there and said, I have this great way. You'd felt like asking a question, and it turned out that your question was the one that deflated the company. You'd have felt like the hunter who killed Bambi's mother. It's a great story, and you destroyed it right there. So that's what I call a runaway story, a story that sounds so good that nobody wants to ask that question. See, what was the board of directors doing while all of this was going on? So everyone then looked up who was in the board of directors. So this is what the board of directors looked like. My first reaction as I looked at that list was, he's still alive? Him too? There's George Shultz. He used to be Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan in 1981. He's a sprightly 94. Right next to him is Henry Kissinger. What the hell is he doing in a blood testing company? He's probably talking about the Iron Curtain in Vietnam. Half of this board looks like a CIA front, and the other half looks like, you know, people who are sold, they have no idea what's going on. This is a runaway story, and when you see runaway stories, you're going to see phenomena like these unfold. A megalomaniac CEO with a board of directors that's either too old or too decrepit to ask questions, and investors who pile on because none of them wants to ask the question that's going to deflate the story. As a follow-up, we do one other improbable story, and I'll let this go. Now, we're almost at the end here. So just for laughs, I often look at investment banking valuations. It's kind of funny sometimes what they get away with. So this is actually from an equity research report. Any sell-side equity research analysts here? Nobody wants to admit to it. If you are, don't take this personally or take it personally. Frankly, I don't care. So this was a sell-side equity research report on Tesla, a company I valued often on my blog. So I feel pretty comfortable with the company. So it's a company I actually like, but a company I wouldn't buy at today's price. So this was in 2014. The valuation comes out. And I just valued the company in my blog at about $125 per share. So in this equity research report, the analyst comes up with a value of $450 per share. So I'm curious as to why the analyst thinks it's worth so much more. So I pull up his equity research report. It's a 250-pages thing, which should have been the first clue that he was trying to hide something. So I leaf through, and on page 54, he has this D.C.F. So I say, okay, let me take a look at this D.C.F. Because that's where the clues will be as to why his value is so much higher. So here's what I was expecting to see. Revenues which are much higher than mine or margins much higher than mine. So first I check the revenues. And his revenues are very close to what I projected. So I'm puzzled. Because if your revenues are close, then your margins must be much higher. Turns out his margins are a little lower than mine. Now I'm really befuddled. How can your revenues be like mine, your margins be lower than mine, your value be four times higher? So I keep going down the spreadsheet from revenues to operating income to reinvestment to free cash. And I notice there's almost no reinvestment for the next 10 years. Now this is an automobile company. And if you look at the very top line of the sheet, he's estimating that the number of cars Tesla will sell is going from 24,000 to 1.1 million over the next 10 years. Now, Tesla does have an assembly plant in Fremont, but the capacity of that plant, even on a good day, is 250,000 cars. Where are the extra 800,000 cars going to come from? So I called the analyst. And he's actually in an airport on a flight to California to visit Tesla. It must be a shrine that he goes and says, oh, great, Tesla in the sky, you know. I said, look, you know, I've been looking at your D.C.F. And I have some questions. He said, I can't answer those questions. I said, how come? He said, well, I have a team that works on the spreadsheet. I said, you have a team? He said, five people. I said, you have five people that churned out this DCF? He said, you can call me next week when everybody's going to be around. I said, OK. He said, you're not going to write about this in your blog or anything, are you? I said, I'll wait for a week and then I'll slaughter you. So a week later, I call him. The entire team is gathered around. So I call him. The lead analyst picks up the phone. He says, you know what? I can't answer these questions. I really don't do the number crunching. I'm really the chief schmoozer. He says, I schmooze a lot. He doesn't know the words. I talk to the CEO. Then I turn to the second in command. He says, I'm the secondary schmoozer. I go along with this guy. If he's not available to schmooze, I schmooze instead of him. I said, okay. Turn to the third guy. I say, I'm the backup schmoozer in case the first two guys are not. So I said, who does all the work here? And they all point to this 23-year-old kid that they hired last year out of business school. He's the guy. I already feel badly about what I'm going to do. I already feel badly about what I'm going to do. So I ask him, you know, did you do the DCF? He already can see doom and gloom. He says, yes. And I said, can I lead you through some questions here? And he says, yes. And I take him through and he gets it very quickly that there isn't enough reinvestment to build new assembly plants. So I said, what happened? He said, it slipped my mind. I said, what slipped your mind? That I have to build assembly plants. So I said, what happened? He said, it slipped my mind. I said, what slipped your mind? That I have to build assembly plants? Because I just was doing projections and I was doing percent of revenue projections. You know how DCFs, you just... And as I did percent of revenue, it completely slipped my mind that I wasn't setting aside money. I said, you realize you have a problem, right? He said, yes, but I don't know how we can go public with this. We can't go and say to people that it slipped our minds. No. Do you have any suggestions? I didn't give him a suggestion, but he didn't take it. I said, have you ever watched this movie, Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory? Yeah, he was too young. But the oldest, the chief schmoozer said, I've seen that movie. I said, I remember seeing that movie and I was a strange young person. I'm a strange older person. When I came out of the movie, I had a similar movie. I said, I remember seeing that movie and I was a strange young person. I'm a strange older person. When I came out of the movie, I had a similar question. I said, if you remember in that movie, there are Willy Wonka chocolates everywhere. Every store carries them. But there's only one factory. A very inefficiently laid out factory with chocolate rivers running through it. I wondered, how the heck do they produce all these chocolates in that one factory? The answer is actually in the movie. It's the Oompa Loompas that do it. Have you seen these dancing little creatures? They dance and chocolates come flying out. I said, here's my suggestion. Put out a press release that Tesla has fired all of its Fremont workers and replaced them with Oompa Loompas. I call these Oompa Loompa valuations, which is growth with no reinvestment, so either you figured out a way to make the Oompa Loompas work for you, or you just forgot. It slipped your mind to put in the reinvestment. So now I'm ready to convert my Uber story into numbers. I described it as an urban car service company, right? Here's where it shows up. My total market that I aimed for was an urban car service company, right? Here's where it shows up. My total market that I aimed for was the urban car service market of 100 billion. I said it would attract new users into the market. The way I showed this is the urban car service market had been growing at about one and a half to two percent in the previous five years. I let it grow at six percent, new users coming in. I assume that Uber has local networking benefits, not global networking benefits. The market share I gave them in steady state was 10% of the global urban car service market. Huge relative to the typical car service company then, but not a 30 or 40% market share. I assume they could keep this 80-20 mix, completely arbitrary, but if they can maintain that mix, their margins are going to be sky high in steady state. They're going to be about 40%. And I also assumed that they could grow without buying the cars and owning the drivers. And the way this shows up is when I estimate the reinvestment Uber needs, it's going to be small because they can grow without buying new cars. And the way that showed up is when I estimated the reinvestment, I assumed that for every $5 in revenues, they'd have to invested only a dollar in capital. You say, how do I know it's a high number? Or the average for that is about 2.3. That's a typical U.S. company. For every $2.3 in revenues gets a dollar invested. They can get away with a dollar invested for every $5 in revenues. And to discount all of these cash flows, I'm going to use a high cost of capital. Now, here's where I save myself a lot of time. You know how I estimate the cost of capital? I'd go with the beta, risk-free rate, risk premium, all the stuff they make you do in the CFA for weeks and weeks and weeks, probably partly because I've thrown out a lot of stuff in there. It's a waste of time even doing that for a company like this. I have actually a histogram of cost of capital for U.S. companies. Basically distribution. I went to the 95th percentile. It's a 12% cost of capital. I gave them a 12% cost of capital. Why? Because I think they're going to be a risky company. I could finesse it and I could put a second decimal point, but what's that going to accomplish? And in doing all of this, I also have to remember that there's a very real chance Uber will not make it. I could finesse it and put a second decimal point, but what's that going to accomplish? And in doing all of this, I also have to remember that there's a very real chance Uber will not make it. Every discounted cash flow valuation is a going concern valuation. Remember that. And if your company will not make it, you're going to overvalue that company with the DCF model. I attached a 10% chance that the company would not make it. Every single part of my story has become a number. And I did the same thing with, and if you take those numbers, there's my valuation. So when you look at it, it looks like a spreadsheet, right? But every single number in that spreadsheet comes from a part of my story. So if you ask me, why are my revenues what they are in year 10? I'm going to tell you the story about an urban car service company with local networking benefits. If you ask me why my margins are so high, I'm going to tell you the story about the 80-20 mix and how that plays out in steady state. If you ask me why my reinvestment is so low, I'm going to tell you the story about how this company can grow with very little capital investment because it doesn't own the cars. And with the story I've told you about Uber and the numbers that come out of it, the value that I got for Uber adjusted for the 10% chance that they would not make it is about $6 billion. So I put this post up on June 8th of 2014. Ten minutes later, I get a call from a Wall Street Journal reporter. She says, I noticed you put up a blog post on Uber. I said, thank you for noticing. She said, I also noticed that you put a value for the company of six billion i said yes that's true she said you do know that venture capitalists have valued the company at 17 billion i almost corrected her right there saying they don't value companies their price but she'd have no idea what i was talking about so i let it go i said yeah she said how do you explain the 17 billion i I said, I don't have to. I didn't pay it. I've never felt the urge to explain what other people do. What business is it of mine? She said, what does it all mean then? I said, all this means is I wouldn't invest in Uber at 17 billion. But if you want to invest in Uber, go ahead. You have to tell a story that justifies your investment. You have to tell a story that justifies your investment. Investing to me is a very personal game. It's not my job to tell you what to invest in. It's my job to tell myself what to invest in. So it's very selfish. When I value a company, it's really for me. It's my story. And if I'm comfortable with my story, who do I care that you're not comfortable with my story? That's your problem, not mine. That's the advantage I have of not being a sell-side equity research analyst because then I have to convince you that my story is the story, thank God I'm not so I'm going to close with that feedback loop thing because it to me is captures the entire focus evaluation, I put this evaluation up on my blog and it got picked up in four very different places the first was a site called 538 haveEight. Have you heard of this? This is a site that was created by a guy called Nate Silver, a statistics geek. It's a great site if you like numbers. It applies statistical techniques to sports, to politics, to business. They liked the fact that I put numbers in. They said, can we post your entire post? I said, as long as you don't mess with it and make changes in it, put the post up, they put the post up. The second place it got picked up was the Forbes blog. You know who reads Forbes blogs? People who are at least 75 years old with flip phones, very old time, old value investors. It's a very different audience. The third place it got picked up was TechCrunch. What TechCrunch is, is actually Silicon Valley inside. So it's read mostly by tech geeks and VCs. And the fourth place it got picked up was the ride sharing guide. This is actually a blog for people who drive for Uber or Lyft. There are enough people who drive for Uber or Lyft that they can actually write a blog just for them. Same post in four different places, I get four very different sets of reaction. Five thirty eight, I'm being read by numbers geeks. So the kinds of questions I ask reflect that. They said, how come using 10% chance of failure? Why not 9.97%? And I always leave my spreadsheets as open space. Why don't you try for 9.97% and tell me what happens? Five minutes later, I get an email and say, now I see why you did what you did. Nothing happened. Okay, let's let it go then. The Forbes blog loved what I did. They said, this is the way the tech guys should be valuing companies. I ignored that blog completely. The TechCrunch guys absolutely detested what I did. They said, how dare you value one of ours? You're a DCF guy. We don't do that stuff in Silicon Valley. Get out of here. And I think there were 5,000 comments on the TechCrunch article. And 4,000 were pure abuse. Things like, you academic, you DCF guy. They managed to convert almost everything in an insult. But 1,000 of them actually told me things about the business that I'm not a tech guy. I don't know how the ride-sharing business works. And if I was willing to be open, I could learn about the business that I'm not a tech guy. I don't know how the ride-sharing business works. And if I was willing to be open, I could learn about the business by listening to people who know a lot more about the business. And on the ride-sharing blog, I heard from Uber and Lyft drivers. And that was the most informative set of posts of all. Because they said things like, you know this 80-20 mix that Uber claims with its investors that it gets to keep? That's a lie. They said in most cities, here's what they do. They keep 20%, but then they kick it back in the form of special bonuses. And they're probably lucky if they make 6% or 7%. You know what? In hindsight, that turns out to be exactly true. Uber claims to its investors that it keeps 20%. But by the time it gets done with all the rest of the processes, its contribution margin is closer to 6% or 7%. I would never have learned that if I talked to the top management at Uber. My suggestion to you is, if you have a value company, don't waste your time with the top management. They either don't know what's going on, or they're masking what's going on. Talk to the janitor. You will learn more about the company talking to the janitor and the mail person than you would to the top management. It all came to fruition for me when I was sitting in Munich airport about two weeks after I write this blog post. My flight's delayed. So I start checking my emails and there's an email from a guy called Bill Gurley. For those of you who don't know who Bill is, he's actually a partner at Benchmark Capital, which actually was one of the earliest VC investors in Uber. They invest in Uber at a $2 billion value. And rumor was he was the guy who was closest to Travis Kalachnik at that time, CEO of Uber. So let me ask a question. This is an easy one. Does Bill Gurley know more about Uber than I do? Absolutely, right? So I open up the email and he said, I read your post about Uber and I did not like it. I said, okay. He said, I've written my own blog post to counter your blog post. It's blog post to blog post warfare, very high tech. And I've said some mean things about you and I just want to let you know. End of email. I close the email. I have an hour and a half left for my flight. Guess where I go next? I go to above the crowd, which is Bill Gurley's blog. And here's what the first post says. Demodrin misses by a mile. Get it? Uber driving misses by a mile. And he essentially took issue with every part of my story. He said Uber is not a car service company. It's a logistics company. Notice how words have consequences. What's he just done? He's expanded his business from car service delivery to moving. He said it's not just urban. It's going to be everywhere. And he gave examples of suburban services we're introducing. And he said we're going to connect with credit card companies and airlines. So when you make a reservation on an airline, you're going to be able to book an Uber. Basically, we're going to be able to expand our local networking benefits to global. He didn't use a single number, but I read his post. I was fascinated by his story. I finished up the story and I still have an hour and 15 minutes left for my flight. So I emailed him back saying, do you want me to put a number on your story? He said, what are you talking about? I said, you've told a really fascinating story about Uber. I can convert to a number. He said, be my guest. So here's what I did. I took my $100 billion total market, which is a car service market, replaced with the logistics market, which is three times larger, $300 billion. I took my 10% market share, which is a local networking benefit, replaced with a 40% market share, which is what you're going to have if you have a global networking benefit. With those two changes put in, the value that I get for Uber is 53 billion. I said to him, do you like this number more? He said, a lot. And he says, you know what, this 80-20 mix, I have to tell you, and just between you and I, it's probably going to drop to about 90-10. We don't really make 20%. I said, that's easy to fix. I go to my spreadsheet, change the 80-20 to 90-10. My value goes to 29 billion. Now you're saying this, you're saying that means I can use the DCF to get any number you want. That's not what I read out of this. If I get big differences in values for companies, it's not because your revenue growth assumptions are different from mine. It's because you're telling a different story than I am. Now, one of us is going to be more right than the other. We won't know till later, but it's hubris to think you own the story on a company. So when I value a company, when people disagree with me, I say, look, you know, I'll give you the spreadsheet. And in fact, I set up almost every single valuation I do as an open spreadsheet because I want people to disagree with me on the story. And rather than tell me I'm wrong, I'd rather they take the spreadsheet and change the story to make it theirs. And that's how you make valuations connect up. The numbers connect to stories, is by forcing yourself to think about the story you're telling that drives a value. So I'll close with a couple of things. One is the company I'm valuing for my two-day valuation session is Henkel. The story I'm going to tell about Henkel is not going to surprise you. It's a solid corporate citizen. It's a very solid company. But I can't tell you a soaring story about henkel that makes its revenues grow 20 a year and a margin go up to 35 it's not going to happen it's a story that reflects the company as it exists today and i have to be realistic if you ask me to value volkswagen the story i'm going to give you is not going to be a happy story. But how can you tell a happy story about a company that's in a bad business that's had the kinds of trouble that Volkswagen did? The Deutsche Bank valuation I did in October of 2016 was a horror story. But that was not my horror that I put in there. It was their own horror of their own creation. So the one thing to remember about business stories is not all of them have happy endings. So sometimes you've got to tell a realistic story and say, this is the end game. It's not going to end well. I'm going to have to reflect that in my valuation. It actually makes valuation a lot more fun to bring in stories because it forces you to think about where your numbers come from. And here's my final anecdote, and I have to be done. So my youngest son, the poet, graduated from high school last year. And it's actually this year, and he had to pick a college to go to. And he got some really good choices. In fact, his final two choices were Wharton and Yale. Now, he never asked me for advice, but for some reason, I think he was really, you know, iffy in the end. He said, you know, he comes to me and says, dad, what do you think I should do? I was thinking about my strategy. Should I give him the answer that I think is right or give him the opposite because then he will do the, because it's an 18 year old. So you give him, tell him one thing, he'll do the exact opposite. Because it's an 18-year-old. So you tell him one thing, he'll do the exact opposite. But if you think about what we just talked about, you kind of can guess what I wanted him to do. If you go to Wharton, you go to a business school. If you get a mini MBA while you're an undergraduate, you'll be trained as a number cruncher. And I told you, he writes poetry. Forget about poetry. If you go to Wharton, every class you take is going to be a business class. They're going to train him to be a good number cruncher. And guess what? Number crunchers are going to get outsourced really fast. We live in a world where what you do is mechanical. Remember, a machine is going to be a lot better at mechanical stuff than you and I are. So I tell people to just take an inventory of the day and look at how much they do each day that's mechanical. And if 80%, 85%, 90% of what you do is mechanical, start looking for another job. Because it's sooner or later the machines are going to take over. Businesses that are mechanical increasingly will get outsourced. It's happening in active money management already. Those money managers are mechanical and most of them are. When you screen and you hope for mean reversion, hey, a machine can screen and do mean reversion just as well as you can. We have to start thinking about kind of combining different skill sets. In fact, last two years ago during the summer, my family and I went to Florence. You've seen the Firenze Dome, right? Brunelleschi's Dome. So after we come out, I said, okay, I have to write a blog post. I said, it's the middle of your vacation. What are you going to write a blog post on? And I wrote a blog post on Brunelleschi's Dome. Those of you who've never been there, Brunelleschi had absolutely no training in architecture, engineering. He was one of those, he actually carved the doors on and he got picked to build the dome. Largest freestanding dome in 1500 years. Nobody knew how to build a freestanding dome that big. He taught himself enough architecture and enough science to be able to build that dome. He said, what's this got to do? I mean, that's a classic Renaissance man, right? They knew a little of this. I mean, basically, that was the skill set. You basically expanded your skill set to be able to do lots of different things. I'm not suggesting we all can become Renaissance. We don't have enough Renaissance people around anymore. We have lots of specialists, people who can trade one thing, and they've done it for all of their lives. They're in silos that are so deep, they have no idea what to do if they're pulled out of their silos. So whatever your weak point is, whether it's storytelling or number crunching, work on it. And if there's anything I hope you got out of this, it's there's hope. Even if you're a pure number cruncher to be able to tell stories. It is enough of a skill set that you can pick it up. It won't come naturally to you, just like it didn't come naturally to me, but it can be done.\n"
