I look for other countries which have similar scores between 50 and 55. three of them were rated I looked up their Equity risk premiums I took the average and attached it to North Korea and I do this for each of the underrated countries home free but there are a couple of catches in using political risk Services score for instance if you look at Libya with a score of 73.75 that looks like a pretty safe country according to political risk Services I talked about how that might be an issue in some countries where you say look I don't agree with that score I don't think it's that safe but in a sense I don't want to be the person passing judgment here I've used that political risk Services score to estimate an equity risk premium of only 7.89 for Libya it's a green part of the map in a part of the world where it's mostly red so those are the equity risk premiums across the world as I said earlier there is no intellectual Firepower Behind These Aquarius premiums it is not like I do research in each country I don't know much about these countries and it's a pretty mechanical process because it's based on ratings for those countries that have that have ratings the default spreads that go with those ratings it is based on political risk services for those countries those of those scores are not available am I completely comfortable with all",

I'm actually losing the last 10 years of data it's a data problem the second is as with the historical spring you are assuming that the structure is not changing that the underlying fundamentals are not shifting and I would say the same thing that I said about historical risk premiums were not in the 20th century anymore in fact I would argue that it's time to let go of the 1928 to 1960 data because it was an uncommon period for U.S stocks finally many of the pushes I've seen for this approach talk about the R square and we're impressed 70 r squared remember you can't trade r squared you can have a model with high r squared",

Moody's joins the parade expect that to be my adjustment now what does this all mean for you as investors as investors we don't realize",
