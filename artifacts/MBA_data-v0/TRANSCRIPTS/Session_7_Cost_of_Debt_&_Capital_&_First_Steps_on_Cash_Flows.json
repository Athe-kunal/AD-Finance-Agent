{"text": " last question before we start you can be on the recording I have one more are you reading any books do you have any books to recommend I don't read I think we are reading is vastly overrated to be quite honest we read too much we think too little and I that sounds like an extremely strange thing to say your way to an answer. For this class, you have no choice but to read some of this stuff. But I would say, you know, there's nothing, no rocket science, nothing that I'm going to write that you can't think through on your own. No, it'd be hubris on my part to think that somehow I have this special insight that nobody else does because I don't. Okay, folks, welcome. It's time to begin give me a valuation as of January 1st, 2023, and you tell me to buy as of January 1st, 2023, what the heck am I supposed to do with that? You can't act on a valuation from a previous point in time because there's nothing I can do about it. If you want to act, your valuations have to be current. valuing the company as of January 1st, 2023? No, you're not. Why not? On January 1st, 2023, would you have had access to Tesla's December 31st, 2022 report? No. In fact, it wasn't until February that that report came out. So today, the first question I'm going to ask you is a very simple one. If your job is to work, come the one that came out, no, it's the latest report that's come out. But if you try to value your companies today, and some of you should try, I sent you that Excel spreadsheet, and you're looking for updated numbers to use from an accounting perspective, many of you still have 10Ks The third choice is to add up the last four quarters of numbers that you have for your company. It's called a trailing 12 month number. It's easy to do. And come up with a trailing 12 month number. The fourth choice is to take, let's say you have the first three quarters of 2022 out, but you don't have the last quarter is to fill in the gap by looking at estimates for the fourth quarter. It's old, right? You're valuing a solar tech company. I'll wager the 2021 report is going to be ancient history. And the younger the company, the more you worry about it. B should be off the table as well. And what is it about B that you're troubled? Because quarters are heterogeneous. You have Christmas sales, holiday sales. You can't multiply that by four. You take a retail company, you take the third quarter and multiply by four, still 2021. Use trailing 12-month numbers, but leave the door open. Forward. Hopefully sometime between now and April, your company's fourth quarter numbers should roll in. Be ready to update your numbers. You're saying, won't that be a lot of work? Not really. Just updating numbers and evaluation. Don't wait till April to value a company. Value a company today and update the you ran into CapEx, or if you're an accountant, you ran into CapEx multiple times over your life. In which financial statement do you usually report CapEx as an accountant? Income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows. Income statement? Balance sheet. It should be the statement of cash flows. You can indirectly maybe get it out of the balance sheet, but it's usually in the statement of cash flows. And I remember what my accounting professor told me about they pass the accounting test and actually show up as CapEx in the statement of cash flows? Building a manufacturing plant. Yes. CapEx is the first test. Does it also show up as CapEx on the statement of cash flows? Yes. So on manufacturing companies, accountants do fine. How about R&D expenses for a technology company? First, is it a CapEx if you define it as an expense that you to buy more coke it's to build a brand name right is that brand name advertising capex is actually the capex for a company. So I am going to stop the share and reshare. I'm sorry, like doing a dance here. So where we left off, you guys can see the discount rate slide, right? So where we left off last session was talking about the cost of equity. And the cost of equity is a function of the risk-free today. Two key words there. One is long-term. Why do I throw that in there? It's not true right now, but in most years, when you look at the term structure, short-term rates versus long-term rates, what does the term structure look like in most typical years, in most normal years? Short-term rates are lower than long-term rates or higher? They generally tend to be lower, right'm going to compute the cost of debt. Since it's a long term cost of debt, I'm going to start with a long term risk free rate and add to that a default spread. What's the default spread? It's a spread that lenders are going to charge you because of how much they're worried that you might not pay them. you're saying how does that help me if you can give me a rating for your company i can tell you what default spread goes with that rating i can update that rating and i'll give you ways of doing it you can get the most updated spreads for your company so if you have a rating for a company you can use the default spread based on the rating in some cases you'll actually find that your company has bonds outstanding and you might think that you've. And your job is to assess the cost of debt for the company, not the bond. This is why Moody's actually an S&P rate companies, but they also rate bonds. Most of the time, the two will converge, but you can actually have a double A or a them a rating. Sounds incredibly complicated, but ratings agencies are in many ways the most transparent organizations in the world. You know why? Because they tell you what the rating of every company they rate is. It's public information. They also give away the store. They tell you the eight ratios they claim to use to come up with the rating. Moody's and S&P used to have that in their front page. These are the eight ratios. the ratings with the interest coverage ratio. Interest coverage ratio, for those of you forgotten your accounting, is this earnings before interest and taxes divided by interest expense. So if you look at Embraer, for instance, I took the earnings before interest and tax, I normalized the numbers because they jumped around. I looked the average divided by interest expense. I come up with 3.56. What does that tell me? For every dollar of interest expenses, they have $3.56 in operating income available. the nice thing, you have a private company, you can still compute an interest coverage ratio. Go to the table, use the table to go. You're saying, why are there two columns? One is for larger companies and one is for smaller companies. Life isn't fair. And larger and smaller years based on market cap, Embraer, the rating I gave them was A- and the default spread is 1%. Now, if this were a US company, I'm done. I take the risk-free rate, I add the default spread for Brazil, and most companies, they just add the entire default spread for the country to the cost of debt. Because unlike equity, you can't evade this. Indian companies, even if they get their revenues outside India, often are fully exposed to Indian country risk in terms of cost of debt. But in some cases, like as in Embra mean, things have changed. Today, the table can be much richer because you have more companies rated around the world. But I often use this ratings lookup table in countries like Indonesia or India or Brazil. And people say, but can you do that? Is that okay? And I'll give you a qualified answer. It's okay as long as you're looking at risk-free rates stating the obvious year is not a constant. It changes over time. For instance, take 2022. It was a momentous year, not just for what happened to the T bond rate, but what happened to default spreads. So what you have in this graph is the default spread on seven different ratings classes, AAA, AA, single A, BBB, BBB, single B. And where it says zero is triple C and below. So the last column is high yield bonds. bonds and with that investment grade bonds and higher with investment grade bonds and with AAA bonds. Last year, if you remember, equity risk premiums exploded out of the box and you saw that graph, the same thing happened to default spreads. So even if your rating did not change through 2022, your cost of debt changed dramatically, right? Because your risk-free rate went up and your for your company or a synthetic or an actual rating, that's a default spread I would use, but I'd keep checking those default spreads to see whether they change during the course of 2023, because who knows what this year will bring. So any questions about ratings and default spreads? Yeah, Professor, one question. When you consider the table for the synthetic cost of debt, we're obviously considering that the company hasn't defaulted. ratio not reflecting the restructuring? Because it's restructuring. The interest coverage ratio should reflect that as well, right? But do rating agencies take the same approach? In terms of, look at the airline ratings. If history, I mean, do they consider history? Yes. But if you have great interest coverage ratio as an airline, you're going to get a good rating, notwithstanding your history. If you're permanently tainted as a company once you go bankrupt, So let's talk. Yes, go ahead. Another question here. You mentioned companies outside the US get a portion of- Country defaults. Just do the entire one. Don't even do a portion because we have an Indian company. So basically we're building up to a cost of debt. Start with a risk-free rate in rupees. Add the default spread for the company and add the default spread for the country. And in a strange way, you're just reversing what you did the actual cost of debt relative to Brazil. But it's so much work to do and so tedious. I've stopped doing it. I just add the entire default spread for the country now. Okay, thank you. Go ahead. I wanted to know if it matters what currency the debt is in. Let's say you're an Indian company. That's why I said the risk-free rate matters, right? divided by 1.03, it'll scale up all the spreads to the much higher risk-free rates. Or do your entire analysis in dollars and then do the inflation adjustment on that. That will adjust everything, risk premiums and default spreads for the much higher level of rates. If a company, say an Indian company, is raising debt from an Indian financial company, do you still need to incorporate the... as your basis, then you're on your own in terms of coming up with default spreads based on that, because I don't have a lookup table for that, unfortunately. It's not difficult, though. Go find other companies with similar crystal ratings, see what the rates on their bonds are, and see if you can back into a default spread. Ziki? Hi, Professor. It's also about the two-third. But let's say your company has access to subsidized debt. Why would somebody lend me money at a rate below the market rate? Sometimes governments do that, right? Because they want to encourage a certain export businesses, green energy. I want to ask a question about what to do when you have subsidized debt. And I'm going to use Embraer as my example. If you remember, the cost of debt that Embraer should be paying, given their risk, is 9.29% on the dollar debt. some solution in the middle that you would pick for the company? I'd go for B. You'd pick B? And then what about the subsidy then? Because there is a real benefit you're getting, right? I would pick B as well, but I can't ignore the subsidy. Is there a way you can value the subsidy? Isn't the cost of debt the opportunity cost? So we want to use the market rate. I agree with the rationale for using B, but I'm saying, notwithstanding that, which is this is not the rate you can borrow money at outside. And second, you're running the risk of locking it in forever. And the danger there is subsidies end at some point in time. So I think that the right solution is to continue to use the US. There are those subsidies add to your value as an auto company. The question is, how much do they add? And what effect will it have on your value? So you got a cost of equity, you got a cost of debt. Are you essentially double counting that? Because it would also show in the increased cash flows. No, not really, right? What cash flows do we discount with the cost of capital? know the right choice, but then I'm going to put you on the spot and ask you to justify what every corporate finance textbook asks you to do it as religion. So here are the choices. First is, you could use book value weights, book value of equity, book value of debt. It's right there, right? Shareholders equities, book value of equity. The second is you can use market value weights, market value equity, market value of debt. What does every finance textbook suggest you should use as weights when you do spot of having to justify the market being right. It's not that. Could it be that market values are easy to get? Book values are just as easy, right? They're both easy to get. Is it because book values of capital and end the valuation by saying, I got an intrinsic value per share that's higher than the price per share. So fire that away. If somebody asks, why do we use market value rates? Don't dance around. Don't talk about market efficiency. multiplied by a mature market premium, and then broaden the country risk through a lambda and a country risk premium. And of course, if I wanted to do this in one step, I could have done a weighted average equity risk premium. Cost of equity of 10.7%. Cost of debt we just went through, T-bond rate plus default spread for the country, 4%, plus default spread for the company, 1%, 9.29%. relative to the book value of debt? Much lower or much higher? Much lower, right? The book value of debt reflects what they're expected to pay, but because you're in so much risk, you're not sure you're going to see a market discount. So here's what I'm going to do to convert book value of debt to market value. It's a neat little trick. File it away even if you don't use it. Sometimes you'll find it useful. The book value of debt at Embraer is 1.953 billion. That came off the balance sheet. Present value, the coupons, and then you add the present value, the face value. The coupons here are $222 million a year. I take the present value of a coupon every year for four years at 9.29%. So in the calculator, you're entering $929 as your payment, N as four years. Discount rate is 9.29%. You hit the present value, you're going to get a present value of $222 million for four years. The $1,953 million is like the face value of the bond. It's coming in at the end of the fourth year. I don't seem to be multiplying. Why am I multiplying my cost of debt by one minus the tax rate? Ed? Is it paid pre-tax? Because 9.29% is what I pay pre-tax. And what does the tax code in much of the world allow me to do? Give you a tax shield. Claim the interest expense as a tax deduction. Okay. I'm reflecting that. Equity, it's extremely unfair because if I have to the income statement, the accrual income statement, there's a tax line item and a taxable income line item. It's accrual taxes divided by accrual taxable income. Basically, do any of you use TurboTax or a tax software to do your taxes every year? I do. I've done it for a long time. And it always pisses me off after I've gone through and input the numbers at the very end. Here's what TurboTax will come in and say. is short, what are the marginal tax rates? It's the tax paid on the last dollar of earnings you made. Tax paid on the last dollar of earnings. And where would I get that? Let's say you're in the U.S., you're a U.S. company. What's the tax rate I pay on the last dollar of my income? I'm going to start with the federal tax code, right? What's the federal tax rate on corporate income? you're Texas-based and you have very low corporate taxes. It can be as 27% in New York and California, but it's about 25%. The average effective tax rate for US companies last year was about 18%. So the question I'm asking with the cost of debt is which of those two tax rates should I use to get the after-tax cost of debt? Should I go with the effective tax rate, which is going to be 16, 17, 18, interest, basically. So again, let me use TurboTax to illustrate the point. Let's suppose you have a million dollars in taxable income. If I'm insulting you, add an extra zero, make it 10 million if that makes you feel better. Let's say you have $100,000 in interest expenses. So tell me what happens. You take the million, you subtract out the 100,000, you report $900,000 in taxable income, right't borrow money in Ireland for their Irish sub. They borrow money in the US. It doesn't make sense for companies to borrow money in low tax locales. It's a choice. So I'm going to go you a quick and dirty way in which you can go from a US dollar cost to capital to a REI cost to capital. And this is actually going to be in response to Anurag's earlier point about default spreads. And what if you have a risk-free rate that's very different? Do everything in US dollars, in this case, 9. it needs is bringing inflation into play. One final point, and this is something that some of you will run into. In my cost of capital, notice there were only two components, debt and equity. And I tried really hard to make sure there are only two components. when stock prices are soaring in other words it's a conversion option that becomes very valuable if your stock price keeps rising at some point you say i'm going to become one of those guys and you convert your bonds in equity a convertible bond is two pieces to it a straight bond because as long as you hold it as a bond you get coupons like any other bond you get face value so you have the choice of leaving a convertible bond as a bond collecting coupons and face that that's a 7%. It's like very expensive debt. You know why it's very expensive debt? Because unlike debt, where you get the tax benefit from interest expenses, on preferred stock, you get no tax benefits. By itself, preferred stock is an extraordinarily inefficient way to raise capital. It's a stupid way to raise capital. So you say, why do companies do it? You know what the sector that use? authorities as equity, not debt. It's an absurd rationale, but banks can now issue preferred stock, very expensive debt, but because it gets counted as equity, meet the regulatory capital requirement. So if any of you are valuing banks, don't be surprised if there's a third component of capital. You've got equity, you've got debt, you've got preferred stock. Treat it as a third component. Give it its own cost. The cost of preferred stock is just the preferred dividend is 4%. And the market value of the convertible bond is 140 million. And as a final piece of information, let's say this company has a rating of single A, and that single A rated bonds have a interest rate of 8%. So if this company had issued straight bonds, it would have had to pay an 8% coupon instead of issued convertible bonds. So here's my task for you. You know the total value of the convertible debt is 140 million. You're trying to 48.55 million for? The conversion option. You take that, you put into equity, the 48.55, you put the 91.45 into debt, you got rid of the hybrid. It's now debt and equity. You can move on. I've been doing this for 30 years. I heard that IFRS now requires companies with convertible debt to now do it. Eventually, accountants catch on. then you might have to value the conversion option with an option pricing model and come up with the value of equity. Like you do with employee stock options. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Got it. So let's recap the cost of capital. So the cost of equity comes from a risk-free rate of aid and equity risk. The cost of debt is the rate at which you can borrow money long-term today just for the tax benefits. The weights are market value weights. to set the table. Often I hear analysts talk about free cash flows. You go to Bloomberg, it says FCF. You go to Capital IQ, it says FCF. And I'm always left puzzled because FCF isn't complete, right? To whom? To equity or the firm? So let's set the table. Free cash flow to equity versus free cash flow to the firm. Free cash flow it's investing in long-term assets. I'm going to include, I'm going to take the difference in capital expenditures and depreciation. Why the net effect? Because depreciation is an operating expense, but it's not a cash expense. It pays for some of CapEx. It's called net CapEx. Net CapEx measures what you're putting back in the firm. When you do free cash flow to the firm, you subtract out reinvestment, you're done. When you're doing free cash flow equity, you're one final cleaning up to do. Think like an equity investor. When you take on new debt, when you borrow money, the minute after the borrowing is approved, what happens? Cash comes into the company, right? From the lender. And every time you repay debt, that's cash leaving the company. So the final element you're screwed. Because your earnings number is screwed up. Everything else is going to be screwed up. We're going to talk about accounting fraud and why evaluation can't tell you about accounting fraud because it's built on accounting earnings. We'll talk about some of the checks you can run, but that's your starting point. Second, you've got to figure out how much your company is reinvesting to grow. And third, you've got to look at these cash flows from debt. cash flow of the firm you just saw is after-tax operating income minus this capex minus depreciation plus change in working capital. That's a correct computation. That's what you see in every textbook. But what if I took this number, capex minus depreciation and change in working capital, and consolidated and called it reinvestment? It's the same thing, right? I'm just giving it, I'm just consolidating the numbers. After- it, which is strange, right? Because that's a real tax savings. So why am I excluding those tax savings from interest expenses when I compute free cash flow to the firm? What is my rationale for excluding it? Because this is free cash flows to the same tax benefits and I lower my discount rate, I'm double counting. That's why the tax savings from interest expenses should not be part of your free cash flow to the firm. Why do you do that? and then use the pre-tax cost to dead my discount rate to make my discount rate higher. And is your method going to give a cleaner view of the cash the business is throwing off as opposed to the temporary shelter? Is it cleaner though? Because often people describe the free cash flow of the firm as an unlevered cash flow, which is the cash flow you would have had with no debt. The minute you start adding the tax savings from debt to the cash flow, you can't use the word unlevered anymore because clearly the leverage is affecting the cash flow. So up with free cash flow equity. Or I can make the net debt, net it out against reinvestment called equity reinvestment. Effectively, all I'm saying is when you see these different terms, my end game is still the same. I want to come up with after debt cash flows. So if you find one of these equations confusing, just go to whatever equation you find comfortable, because if you do it right, you should get exactly the same answer, no matter which pathway you use. this is what I did. And essentially, I go through both the free cash for the firm calculation, that's what you see to the right, and the free cash for the equity calculation for Microsoft. By itself, this chart tells you nothing, but read that post, because if nothing else, it'll make you comfortable with what you're doing differently in the two approaches, and why it's dangerous to mix and match. of normalizing numbers. I'll come back and talk about this more in the next session. You think, when would I do this? You know, oil companies were the most profitable companies in the world last year. And that just two years ago, oil companies were among the least profitable companies in the world in 2020. You think, what changed? What do you think changed? What's the difference between 2020 and 2022 that explains the swings in oil companies? Oil prices. Oil prices. Demand. because internally they have these inconsistencies that can affect what you see as earnings. I've kind of opened the door for that a little bit when I talked about R&D with the start of the class. It's really a capex they treat as an operating expense. And until 2019, there was a financial expense that accountants routinely categorized as an operating expense. You know what I'm talking about? They do it finally. All you need is one annual report and your most recent quarterly report. If you have the most recent annual report and the most recent quarterly report, computing trailing 12-month is a simple exercise. If you don't believe me, I think this week's Valuation Tools webcast will show you how to get to trailing 12-month from a 10-K and a 10-Q or an annual and a quarterly report. It's not difficult to do. And the second is capital expenses like R&D that they've routinely miscategorized as operating expenses. So I want to take you through the process of capitalizing. You're saying, why bother with leases? They do it. I want to give you a window on what accountants are doing with leases now that they always should have been doing. So you can get a sense of what exactly are accountants doing when they capitalize leases. So let me set the table on leases. businesses where leases are a big deal. So I'm going to start by giving you my rationale for why leases have always been debt, notwithstanding the accounting mistreatment. I mean, here's how I think about debt. Debt is any source of capital that gives rise to contractual commitments. You know what I mean by that? You take a bank loan, there's a contractual commitment. You've got to make interest expenses. You issue corporate bonds as a contract to do to capitalize leases. You take the contractual commitments you've already entered into. You take the present value of those commitments. So if you tell me you have contractual commitments of 100 million every year for the next five years, I'm going to take the present value of those commitments using the pre-tax cost of debt as my discount rate. I'm going to end up with a debt value of leases. I'm going to put that on my balance sheet. out the entire lease expense because you could subtract out only the depreciation portion of it. Everything changes when you capitalize leases. So as a final exercise for today, here's what I'd like to do. I'm going to take you through a company where I capitalize leases. I actually did this for this company 25 years ago because they thought that an accounting change was imminent. So these are not expected lease payments. These are actual contractual commitments, discounted them back at the pre-tax cost of debt for the gap, which was 6%. What I got as a present value is $4.4 billion. That's now going to show up on my balance sheet as debt. And wherever I use debt in my calculations, like in the cost of capital, you're going to see me add the $4.4 billion to that conventional debt. The total debt for the gap is much greater than what you saw on the balance sheet. you get an adjusted operating income. If you're really in a hurry, there's a shortcut you can use, but it's only if you're really in a hurry. You can take the operating income and add back the imputed interest expense you'd have had on the debt, because if you claim it's debt, there'd have been interest expense. Do it only if you're in a hurry. The first approach with 1,362 is the right one. So I'm going to leave you with a final table, because this is will go down from the 7.31% I thought it was. Now they were hitting the roof. They thought this is great. I have higher earnings. I have lower cost of capital. Life is good. And I said, there's one final catch. The way we measure quality of investment, we compute the return on capital you make on the investment and we compare to the cost of capital. If I stayed with conventional accounting, all I counted in return For some, it'll drop value. And the reason we capitalize leases is to get a much better sense of both what you owe, which is a good thing to know, as well as what you're making on your projects. So when we come back on Monday, and we'll be back in class, what you recommend is the best way to prepare for the quiz next week? Well, do a lot of prompts. Here's the one thing you cannot do. Don't just review the notes and say, I kind of get this. I'm going to be okay because you're going to get to the quiz. It's open book, open notes. You don't have to memorize equations, but if you've never worked through prompts, you're going to be in trouble. So first step, review the slides. Get a sense of material. Then go through the practice quiz. Thank you. Professor, I got a question at size 109. About when we decomposing the convertible bonds, the goal we're trying to do that is depositing into the debit and equity and in the market value version. But here, when we do that, as the method we mentioned in the slide, debt not just convertible debt all debt normally the market value of debt can be close to book value because we take if this bond had been issued at a fair market rate let's say there was no conversion option let's say it issued the bond with an eight percent what would the present value of the debt be exactly equal to the book value the reasons market value and book value vary is because you borrowed money at a rate that's different from the market interest rate today Thank you. Thank you so much. Professor, I will take my question next time. My question was more on capitalization of leases. Let's wait till next time because I will start next session with capitalization of leases. And I'm going to expand and argue that it's not just if it's a subscription you've locked yourself in for multiple years i'm yes i've locked myself for next the rules from FSAB, and our accounting team doesn't budge. They don't give us a capital treatment. So that becomes a challenge every year that we face. You got to fight that fight. It's not easy to fight. It takes them forever to change. Thank you. Oh, Professor, I just remember that during the explanation, one of our classmates said that we can use Black-Strips model saying market value is not equal to intrinsic value then everything has to be intrinsic value right market cap is not intrinsic value we use it anyway why do we use it because that's what the market that's what you have to pay in the market today this is yeah yeah so i i don't think that's a big issue no okay we know the total value all it means is you're putting more into one and less into the other oh yeah yeah that's true that's true okay thank you take care see you volatility because black shoals formula treats that as a given but it's not actually for example if a company is not it's the easiest of all inputs look up there's a publicly traded company right stock is traded yeah but oftentimes the price um of an option like doesn't match the actual like underlying volatility that's the discrepancy between implied and underlying volatility right i think you you're lost in in the in the forest of options this is you know", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 8.84], "text": " last question before we start you can be on the recording"}, {"timestamp": [8.84, 16.82], "text": " I have one more are you reading any books do you have any books to recommend"}, {"timestamp": [16.82, 23.4], "text": " I don't read I think we are reading is vastly overrated to be quite honest we read too much"}, {"timestamp": [23.4, 86.67], "text": " we think too little and I that sounds like an extremely strange thing to say your way to an answer.
