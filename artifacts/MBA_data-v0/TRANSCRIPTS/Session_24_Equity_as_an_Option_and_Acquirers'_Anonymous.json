{"text": " yeah okay. everything I need to know about your company. So give me the story page from your DCF, a pricing, basically the multiple you picked, a very quick description of the comparables and a regression if you ran one in a pricing. For one in 10 companies, maybe what we talk about today of applying option pricing will work and then a recommendation. So this is in Purple Pro. So I'm not looking for extended discourses. You don't have to give me business descriptions. I kind of know what most of your companies do. is I think on the 10th. I think the actual time is 1.30 to 3.30 is I think the official time. I'll make sure I'll confirm that for you because sometimes I get the times differently. So it'll be a two-hour final. It'll be open book, open notes, everything in the class, which is a lot of stuff. So it'll be everything in quiz one, quiz two, quiz three, and the stuff after. So with that lead in, let's complete our discussion of real options. at least show up. You can value that as an option. It's a tough option to put numbers on, but in the case of Disney, I came up with 85 basis points. So there is the trade-off. By being under 11, they give up 50 basis points a year, but by being under 11, they get this flexibility option that's worth 85 basis points, which means that they should stay under 11, even though it looks like their cost of capital is high. As I said, that option itself is tough to get the inputs on. on debt a lot more than companies that have been in good touch. So first thing that matters is capital constraints. Not all capital constraints are external. Some are internal. You know what I mean by that? Many companies will refuse to issue new equity. Once they're public companies, they hate issuing new shares. Why? There's dilution. So some of this is internally set, and that often will also feed into capital constraints. The more internal capital constraints Acquisition driven growth is far more unpredictable than internal investment growth because you don't know what you'll have to pay, who you're going to buy. I would expect companies that grow through acquisitions to hold back on debt capacity more because they value financial flexibility. But here's a final and to me, the most significant component in whether you should stay under levered because you value financial flexibility. Why are you preserving this debt capacity? Because you want to take investments, right? room for when you look at a publicly especially in corporate financial you talk about optimal debt ratios give companies some grace when they're under levitating in this company that's okay it's a young company it's a small company it's a capital restricted company it's in a great business therefore that's okay which brings me to the last application this in an ironic way is the most common way in which you can apply options in the context of valuation you and say your share price went to minus $31, please send $31 more. As opposed to a private business where equity can have unlimited liability in a public. So those two features conspired to create the equity option. So let's set up the option. What you have, so you guys play the role of equity investors, I'm lenders to a company, right? So you run the company. Can equity investors in a company choose to liquidate the company if they want to? Yeah. No, you get together in a firm is essentially a call option if you think about the liquidation as the strike feature, as the exercise of the option. Sounds like a very strange view of equity, right? Because most of us when we buy shares in companies buy it for different reasons. You buy shares in Con Ed, what are we buying it for? Come on, you can help me on this one. I just want to get the dividend in my pocket, right? Forget about the stability and the growth. something good will happen. You pray that something good will happen. And most of the time, nothing good happens. So you take the 35 cents you paid per share, you drop it in the trash can. Sounds like a crazy reason to buy, right? So what are you hoping for? That something, some event will come around and turn the company around and the 35 cents will become $2. It's not becoming a healthy company, but it's becoming a wait and you wait and you wait because time is your ally. So unlike other real options where you get early exercise here, you're going to let it play for as long as you want, but there can be forced exercise, which is when the interest payments come to you. So that's something you got to build into the model is you control the action until you don't. So the first%. I'm going to argue that very, very limited information. You should be able to tell me how much the equity in this company is worth. And you should be able to tell me what interest rate you would charge in the debt. I haven't given you betas, cost of capital, cash flows. What did I say you guys have? You have an option on the company, right? That's valued as an option. value that 40% squared is 0.16 and the riskless rate is 10%. SK, NFD1, NFD2. I'll come back and talk about the NFD2 because there's a very clear meaning to this NFD2 here. But you plug in the numbers, the value that I get for the call is 75.94 million. So what does that even mean? The equity is a call option. The company, it's right? There's a 63% chance that the value of the firm will be greater than the debt outstanding, which means there's a 37% chance of bankruptcy. There's an outfit called KMV. It's a West Coast-based outfit that has used option pricing models to estimate default probabilities for companies' loan portfolios. million. Unless you have a very perverse definition of good news, this is not good news for you as an equity investor, right? See, equity yesterday was worth 75.94 million. It's clearly going to be worth less today. So I have a very simple question. How much less will the value of equity be? And here are your choices. Value of the firm drops by 50, you can take 50 out of the value of the equity. 75.94 minus 50 would give me 25.94. but I replaced the 100 million with the 50 million. I valued the option and what I get as the value of my equity is 30.44. It's absolutely right. My value dropped by 45 and a half million, but by only 45 and a half million. Who made the value of the business 5 million. And the, it's a basket case company, right? It owes, it has an $80 million zero coupon bond outstanding. What's keeping the equity afloat here? you have 10 one-year options. So the structure of thinking stays the same. It just means that you have a one-year call option followed by another. It's actually a very messy set of options because each option's values are functional whether the previous option stays alive. It can be done. So the thought process stays the same. It just gets a lot messier when you have 10-year. I'm going to give you a simplistic way of getting around that. But you're right. This 10-year zero coupon is a complete artifact, right? safe, troubled company. I don't even know what that means. But if a company says, look, I can guarantee you, I will lose a hundred million every year for the next 10 years. This is not a good candidate. You want to put your equity in deeply troubled, risky companies, because that's the only way you get out from underwater to above water is you would need a huge volatility in firm value to come about. Yes. Absolutely. You're the manager of the firm. You cater to the equity investors. I come to you with a project and I want to sell you the project. So I start by describing the project. It's a negative net present value of minus 2 million. What's your first reaction? Get out of here. I said now gone to 77.71. But it's not quite. I've just stolen enough money from my bondholders to cover the negative net diverge. Yes, sir. I was like the CEO's stock options, a version of this, where the more risky the company can be. That's part of the problem. In fact, did everybody get the point, which is, remember when people were given options and they were told this will match incentives up? It doesn't quite, right? Because options are driven not just by the value of the stock, but the variance in that value. Whereas you as a shareholder want in 16 feet of water or 35 feet of water. That's basically it. I mean, no bed, bath, and beyond CEO saying, let me take the cautious view here. They're going to put everything on the table because what do they have to lose? They're going to go bankrupt anyway. This just means there's some chance, a small chance of making it out of there. So it's a residual claim and the limited liability that essentially makes equity and mistakes take bigger and bigger risk because you have less and less to lose to buy another firm, which is valued at 150 million, they pay a fair value. What's a conventional wisdom of what will happen to your stock price when you pay a fair value? Nothing should change, right? Zero net present value. Let's see if that's in fact true by playing this out. So you know what, there's firm A that we just valued. There's firm B that you're acquiring at fair value. The two have standard deviations that are different. They're in different businesses. Remember though what happens to the firm when you combine it, right? 4 million was the value of the equity in firm A, 134.47 million was value of equity in firm B, fairly valued. The combined company, the value of equity I get is about $3 million lower. And that's a direct consequence, again, of a transfer of wealth away from equity investors to lenders. So this is the flip side of what we saw in the previous section. You're a conglomerate, you keep buying other companies and other businesses. And if you refuse, remember, much of U.S. debt can be repaid in advance, right? There's no restrictions on repaying in advance. You repay that debt, replace it with new debt, add a lower interest rate. But if you don't watch that wealth transfer, you can very quickly see it's not big. So you don't even notice it seeps away with each acquisition. So you can see the construct for valuing equity. But as you pointed out, I made a lot of very simplistic assumptions to get there. assets becomes the S in the model. That's a value of a company as a going concern. If you don't have time to do a discounted cash flow valuation, you can do a liquidation valuation. If I sold the pieces or a pricing, that becomes the S in the model. What would I get if I liquidated the company today? For the variance in that value, if your company is publicly traded, you have two numbers out there where you can use to of the danger the company is in. For the value of the debt, here's where I'm going to cheat. I'm going to take all of your debt outstanding. I'm going to gather it all into one big lump sum. One-year debt, three-year debt, five-year debt. And then I'm going to take a weighted average, if I can, the durations of each of the debt. But if So I did a valuation. So at the time that I valued Euro tunnel, I first wanted to make sure it meet the criteria for an option pricing model. First it was losing money. It was losing lots and lots of money. And it lost so much money that its book value equity had turned negative. So that's a sign that it's not just losing money for one year, it's been losing money for a long time. So it's a money loser with a long history. built in the usual way you deal with a money losing company. I fixed the margins over time, no recovery built in. The value that I got was 2.3 billion. What's the outstanding debt? Remind me again. 9 billion. My discounted cash flow valuation of the company, assuming it makes it back to health, is 2.3 billion. This is a my debt, 8.9 billion. Deep out of the money option, but I knew that was coming. One advantage I have is the debt is really, really long-term. So even though I have some short-term debt, the bulk of the debt is long-term. I have 10.93 years to play this game. is in fact the perfect prototype for a basket case company miracle of options the value of the equity is 122 million why am i paying 122 million because i've 10.93 years but something good can happen and if that happens who knows what the value of equity could become so as you watch airlines go in and out of bankruptcy and you watch their going to get long-term call options or leads. But it's a mindset that basically, again, even if you never apply an option pricing model to value equity in a company, I want you to think acquisitions. And now the title kind of gives away what I think about acquisitions. About 20 years ago, an old student of mine ended up setting up this executive seminar series. That was his business. He ran executive seminars. So he ran an executive seminar the session that I gave these acquirers, because I made these CFOs a deal. I said, look, I'm going to take you through a series of seven very basic fundamental tests on acquisitions. And if you fail on more than two of the tests, I'd like you to stop doing acquisitions. None of them took me up on the deal. But for those, any of you planning to be an M&A? very happy. It's shareholders in the target firm. And the other group, which is always feeling a little mixed about what just happened, because on average, at least, acquiring firm shareholders don't seem to share the sports. The game seems tilted in favor of target company shareholders. This is public to public companies. We'll talk about public to private, public to public companies. If there's a winner in the game, it's clearly the shareholders of the target company. so much time in the deal that... So if you ask them, they'll just say, just wait, because if managers are right, what should happen? Five years later, when you look at these deals, the acquiring company should have gained, it should have seen an increase in value. And if you look at the evidence on post-acquisition results, so these are studies that McKinsey does, KPMG does, following up five years and 10 years after the deal, McKinsey actually asked very simple questions. Did the return on capital invested in the acquisition exceed the cost of capital? because the combined firms' earnings should go up relative to the standalone firms. And they found that one in six mergers deliver synergy. About two in six deliver nothing, which leaves a half of companies where they actually found negative synergy. We say, what's negative synergy? Two companies come together. The combined company somehow manages to underperform the two companies standing alone. acquiring UK companies or US companies. And when you look at those companies, you seem to see the same kind of evidence you saw with US acquirers play out. When you look at Chinese acquirers, Indian acquirers, there's something fundamentally wrong here. Because it replicates across markets, across acquisitions. So one of the questions, of course, is, you know, is this the process by Now what I'd like to do is talk about how that skewed process plays out in bad choices when it comes to valuation. I would never teach an M&A class because I'd run out of stuff to say after session one. Because to me, I'm not interested in the deal-making part because an acquisition, you use the acquiring company's cost of debt. You're already loading the dice in favor of the target company shareholders if they're risky, if the target company is a risky company. So we'll see how that plays out. The third is this magical word control. Remember the first session I held up the word control and we talked about 20%. I wasn't being facetious. pricing is based on a multiple and comparables. You're saying what's different about M&A. I think the M&A pricing process is even more screwed up than the typical pricing process because the way in which we come up with comparables and the multiples we end up using. Sixth, and I think this is a big factor, before we blame the bankers, we have to recognize that when CEOs of companies go to a banker and say, should I apart or deal goes bad and you lose billions of dollars you take a bad project and lose 50 million you get fired you do a bad acquisition you cost 50 billion nobody's you get promoted it seems it's a very strange process so i think all of those come into play so let's and so you we can keep so you can keep tabs for yourself i won't check on you as we go through each test as to whether you're passing the test because by now you have below the stock price. In this case, these are not traditional mergers. J.P. Morgan is not doing a traditional acquisition of First Republic. It's picking up pieces. We don't even know what the specifics of the deal are. And for the moment, we have no idea whether this is a good deal or a bad deal for J.P. Morgan shareholders. My guess is that they will walk away with the good deal and leave the residue for somebody else to pick up, probably taxpayers to pick up. But we'll see. operating income becomes your free cash flow. I'm trying to keep things simple so you're not doing a reinvestment rate. So your cash flows every year are going to be 12 million a year, right? So your depreciation, capex, all of that kind of goes to zero. So you get 12 million in cash flows every year in perpetuity. Let's say the cost of equity for this company is 20%. It's all equity funded. So you got 12 million in cash flows every year in perpetuity.' cost of equity. You're a safe company. We'll push up the value of the target company. For all the wrong reasons, the target company didn't become more valuable. You've effectively subsidized the target company by applying your cost of equity to the target company. So when you think about looking at target companies, the point I made earlier with the Congolium example, it's always the target company's risk characteristics that should drive the discount rate for the target company without factoring in that they were buying. And you're saying, won't the mistakes average out? They won't, right? Because they're always going to cut in one direction. Because when you try to value a safer company to your cost of equity, you're going to find that they're unreachable. All the riskier companies are going to look cheap to you. That's risk subsidization. Yes. Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway doesn't do first a lot of acquisitions. Many of them are smaller companies. Most of their investments are in publicly traded companies as just holdings, right? growing up it's on some other dimension it's not on this one so everybody comfortable with that notion because lisa you're going to have to fight this fight because when you get out there in m&a it's amazing how often the acquiring companies cost of equity and cost of capital like will get used in valuation and you have to be able to explain the consequences of doing this over time because that's the only way you get it because otherwise it's just one deal in fact g's argument i actually you know it's a g's headquarters to be fought because to me, it's a cardinal sin in any kind of valuation. Yes, sir. We know that when a private investor looks at a public company that has capital difference, they have less diversification. In this instance- They'll draw part of the bargaining, right? So if I am bargaining for, if I'm bidding for a public company and there's a public bidder, I start with the only difference is how I use the correlation to get up with it. So it's actually Alan lays the same point because it seemed like a violation of the rule of it's always the target company's carrying. It's still the target company, but the way you see the target company's risk is different depending on potential buyers. And that's what makes your private business valuation buyer specific. Let's talk about cost of debt. Let's say you as the acquiring company have access to really cheap debt. capital, that $60 million company will become a $100 million company. Sounds pretty reasonable, right? I am borrowing money at a low rate. I'm able to borrow a lot of money. So why shouldn't I use that low cost of debt and that debt ratio in my cost of capital calculations? Yes? The risk on the debt is not much greater than the target. I'm giving a $40 million premium to the target company shareholders, right? Why? so on. They chose not to borrow money. Let's say they could have borrowed that money at 6%. Why is it a risky company? I'm okay computing a costly capital using that 20% debt ratio and the 6% cost debt, because that would be a target company debt ratio. It wouldn't be something where I'm allowing the target company to get subsidized because it's part of GE. Think of GE at its peak, AAA rated company, able to borrow money to it as MBA students. It has every acquisition in the US. That 20% is actually the average premium or the median premium, as they say, that companies pay. So the price paid in an they were earning 20 million on $100 million revenue. Let's suppose you think you can run the target company better. Why? You think they're inefficient, their equipment is old. You think that if you ran the company, the margin would be 30%. share of that because somebody's bringing more to the scale of control. Who's doing the work? The problem though is if you end up in a bidding war, it's all control. I can almost predict where you're going to end up. You're going to end up at 90 million because they're going to play you off against each other. But control has nothing to do with two companies coming together. It's the fact that the target company is badly managed and badly run access to debt. Be wary about control. I'm not saying don't pay for control, but if there is control, you have to start to become explicit. What am I going to, what costs am I going to cut? No, is that feasible? And then play it out as a higher value. Let's at least set up the discussion of synergy. about having lower discount rates after the fact, I'm skeptical. And here's why. These were both publicly traded companies, right? You combine two publicly traded companies, there's really no benefits you get as investors from reducing risk because you could have done it yourself. These two companies could have been in your portfolio, 50 other companies. So most of the synergy is going to show up in the cash flows. The question is, what form does it show up? So what I'd like to do, and actually with synergy, again, you got to ask the question, their argument is we can come into Modelo and because we're a big beer company, we can reduce their distribution costs, we can make the marketing costs go to zero, and it worked. They were able to actually cut operating expense by 30%. That's the easiest form of synergy to value because it's right now, it's concrete, you can show it as lower operating expenses, higher operating income valued right away. return on capital, if you can preserve it on new breweries that you build, would show up as higher return on capital and higher growth rate. You're right, it could provide double benefits to you. It could also show up as a higher reinvestment rate, maybe by combining two companies, you're able to find more projects. A classic example is developed market brand name company buying an emerging market brand name company. We're saying, look, that's a big market, we can now sell both our products, much bigger, much going to save taxes. I still remember in 2016, Pfizer came up with this convoluted way of buying Allergan, which is a UK-based company because they wanted to switch their headquarters to the UK and escape what they felt at that time was a very unfair tax law in the US where they would be taxed at a global, the US tax rate on global income. And everybody knew this was driven by taxes. and throw everything as a distraction when all you're saying is, I'm going to save on taxes. See, how can combining two companies save on taxes? It could be as simple as a money-making company buys a money-losing company and the average. Though that's become more and more difficult over time. The IRS has become very clear on you can't combine two companies without meeting these criteria. But it could also be things like being able to write up the book value of assets because you're sometimes allowed to do that, get more depreciation afterwards. higher. For a long time, it explained why Brazil had the lowest price-to-book ratios of companies around the world. It's not because they were cheap, but because Brazilian companies, unlike the rest of the world, we have an incentive to lower book value and an incentive to push it up. You say, how does this help in mergers? The minute after you do a merger, you know what happens to your book values, right? They go to inflation, especially because you're bringing in another company. So I'm going to vote makes a difference, especially when you have big transactions like this. So that's tax savings. There are two other potential financial synergies. In corporate finance, we talk about companies having optimal debt ratios, right? We compute it based on debt, on your earnings and your variance in earnings. Let's say you have two companies which have optimal debt ratios, 20% and are at the optimal. Combining the two companies can sometimes push up your optimal debt ratio, if you look at them in Asia and Latin America, which have been around a long time, will be in every conceivable business. It was their way of dealing with this diversification risk before markets became accessible, is by being, you know, public companies, it does make sense, private companies, it does. Yes. How do you know that that is going to happen? Well, I think two technology companies come together. First, it's got to be a company, two different businesses, you get the greatest benefit. are the potential synergies. So let's talk about valuing synergy in a merger. To value synergy in a merger, you've got to go through three steps. First, you've got to value the acquiring firm and the target firm as standalone entities. Let me repeat that again. You can never value synergy by just looking at the target company. It's impossible to do. So the next time a banker gets up and says, I valued synergy and all they have is the target company.. And it also allows you to ask the question, what if I have to wait three years or five years for synergy to show up? You can see why that can happen, right? You combine two companies. It can take a while to integrate. You can take the present. So you have the mechanics for value synergy. So let's take a couple of examples of synergy so you can see this play out. About 20 years ago, Procter & Gamble, at that time, the largest consumer product company in the world for Gillette. Best case valuation of synergy. You know why I call it the best case? I took everything managers said they would do after the merger, assumed they would do it, and they would do it instantaneously. Every single part of it is extremely optimistic. So they said they could cut operating expense by 250 million. Okay, I believe you. Next year, your expense went down 250 million. They talked about a slightly higher growth rate and they gave like, it had explain away what I paid. And if you do that, you're lost. The game is out of your hands because you're going to get into that negotiating table and you're going to keep pushing up the price. We have synergy that can make up the difference. In fact, if you were a thoughtful banker and a banker actually wanted a good deal, you'd need this $298 billion, the $17 billion from the table. And if you don't want to walk away from the table, you're going to end up overpaying for deals. Take a second example, tax benefits. This was when, you know, Zenith was on its last legs. You know, Zenith has a long and storied history. There was a time when you bought a TV in the US, Zenith was on it, right? When was the last time you saw a new Zenith TV? I mean, at the time that I looked at Zenith for this particular example, the only thing that Zenith had of value of 2 billion, that's 720 million, and that is your value gain. But let's say only a half a billion in operating income every year for the next four years. You still have the 2 billion losses, but now what will your tax benefits look like? It's going to be 720 million right now. It's going to be 180 million a year, right? So there's a time value of money. What else do you have to worry about? The expected operating income is 500 million. You have no idea whether you'll The reason I bring this up in a lot of M&A valuations on the street, I often see NOLs taken multiplied by the tax rate and treated as value today. And that's extraordinarily optimistic if you don't have the income to cover today because you're ignoring what the time value of money and the risk that you might never be able to collect on that NOL. So don't pay for buzzwords. Synergy is up. And one of the things they found in common across those companies, these were companies where plans for Synergy were made before the acquisition. People actually made explicit plans. And this is what we think we can say. And then somebody was held accountable, preferably the same guy who's pushing so hard for this acquisition. Give him the advantage and give her the, you would want this. Then you be responsible for all these nice numbers you're forking. Microsoft Activision, think about what the potential value added is and how you would put numbers on it. It's a good exercise in thinking through what these buzzwords actually mean. I'll see you in one second. you want to use that. So let's say next year or even on that. You can put that in there. It's going to be on the price back to that. Okay. Then use that. And so, and this is the solar panel. I mean, they're basically not manufacturing anything. They are buying solar panels in China and just, they are buying them in China and investing that.", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 12.0], "text": " yeah"}, {"timestamp": [21.68, 150.69], "text": " okay. everything I need to know about your company.
