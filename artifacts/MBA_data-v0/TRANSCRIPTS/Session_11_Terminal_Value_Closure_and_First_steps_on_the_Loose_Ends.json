  "text": " Hello everybody. Thank you. and just check to make sure I haven't screwed up on a grading issue, right? You will never know if you don't look. And let's face it, just because you don't pick up the quiz doesn't mean it's not there. This is some kind of an existential Schrodinger's cat kind of thing. There's no Schrodinger's quiz, which is right. It doesn't disappear just because you don't look at it. So my advice is pick it up, look at it, throw it away it's got to be by the end of March, so try to get your first shot. Okay, so today we're going to complete our discussion of terminal value, and the first question I'm going to ask you is a question that I already answered last week, but it's something that I want you to be prepared for, because as I said, a lot of people who value companies, and they're going to be your colleagues that you get to your five or 10, but you cannot use a multiple. You want to use a multiple? Just do a pricing. Take it a forward pricing. That's all it is. And call it a pricing. Don't call it an intrinsic violation. So yeah, go ahead. If we were to go to firms that that's their standard protocol. Do the kabuki dance. Okay. Right? in that pricing. So there's nothing wrong with pricing. Let's stop being dishonest and labeling pricing as DCR. You know how much time and stress this would remove from bankers if they admitted to the fact that they're doing pricing? Because it'll take all the kabuki dances you do. We have to stay busy. We have to project cash flows. And my question is, why are you wasting your time? It's a forward pricing. Just call it a forward pricing and do it better. In fact, later in this class, no working capital. What is it about the way I've described the company that makes those numbers unnecessary? What's the clue here? Because usually you need cash flows, right? You need to subtract out net capex and change it to working capital. It has no growth. Because it has no growth, it has no reinvestment. If it has no reinvestment, after tax operating becomes free cash flow to the firm, you divide it by 10%, your value is that I didn't have to reinvest. Now you're putting a growth rate. So I need to give you the information to be able to estimate how much you need to reinvest, which means 100 million will get lower. And how much lower it gets will So today we're going to focus on those mechanics, but I want to start with that question of growth rate in perpetuity, because I kind of, we did it towards the end. I want to make sure everybody is, again, comfortable with this, first with the notion of your growth rate cannot exceed the growth rate of the economy forever. The reason I bring that up is I got at be an exception right from the beginning, where's the upside for you as an investor? Basically, you're giving away the game at the start. And if your company is a great company, not an exceptional company, it's a negative surprise. You need to keep something for yourself. So even if your company is special, there's nothing wrong with allowing for longer growth periods, but that doesn't mean you can break this rule. Somebody else, I think, in my undergraduate class said, what if I let the growth rate be just a little bit higher than the growth rate of the economy? And I said, that's like being a little bit pregnant. This is either zero or one. You're either pregnant or you're to year 11? Absolutely. In fact, if you look at the FCF of Ginzo spreadsheet, one of the questions I ask you is, do you want to change the risk-free rate after year 10? I'll tell you why I put it in. During the last decade, what was the lament you heard, especially from older apps? Rates look too low. I said, don't mess with the rate today. It is what it is. But if 10 years from now, you tell me the rate's going to go up to 4%, you can raise it. But when you raise the rate, So if you remember the last decade, there were currencies, and you saw them in the chart where the risk-free rate actually turned negative. And when that happened, people freaked out. I remember Anna saying, you can't do discounted cash flow valuation with negative risk-free rates. My question was, why not? And you know how the reasoning went, right? If you have negative risk-free rates, your cost of capital is going to be really low. economy. A negative risk-free rate also goes with deflation or really low inflation. So you're not going to be able to raise prices like you hoped to. And it also goes with a slowing economy. I said those same forces have to play out in my cash flow. So when I projected the growth rate, when I projected the growth rate, I gave them a 3% growth rate. It's interesting because there were, I think, three people in the audience who were actually from the Heineken finance group. high value is if I use a negative risk-free rate to come up with my cost of capital. But then when I get to the growth rate in perpetuity, I look at the historical 40-year nominal growth rate in the European economy and use a 3% growth rate forever. The problem there is I'm assuming different economies in my numerator and that's causing my valuation to blow up. In contrast, if you're valuing a company's Turkish lira, the discount rate is going to be huge%, then you're staying consistent, your valuation will still work. So let's talk about the second thing in terms of value. This is, I think, something I've already suggested. You sit down and look at a company. So how long will high growth last in my company? A little later in this class, I'm going to show you a graph, which I think is one of the most depressing graphs to look at if you're a growth investor. And that graph comes from a study your companies, how long will growth last at my company? Rather than think of a number, I want you to think about the company's competitive advantages. What are the barriers to entry? And here's a clue. If you cannot find one competitive advantage this company has, give it a very short growth period. We had this brief discussion of brand name that we're going to turn to. And one of the ways I characterize brand name is, whatever the mystery it is that creates a brand name, we know that historically, terminal value, don't forget all the things we talked about in the context of growth. We said to grow, you have to reinvest. And in terminal value, this becomes critical. You can be sloppy in your one, two, three, and talk about efficiency growth, but now you're talking forever. So when you say, I want to grow, I'm going to ask you, how much will you need to reinvest? When I describe the sustainable growth equations, I said they weren't useful in most companies because returns are changing, margins are changing, but I'll tell you what percentage of companies in each sector earn more than the cost of capital if you're in a business where it's difficult to earn more than your cost of capital when you get to year 10 you know the safest assumption you should can make is assume the return capital Professor, we're not able to see the slides on Zoom. It's in the projecting the right size. Can you see it now? Yes, thank you. So if I change my growth rate, I want to see what happens to the terminal value. The cost of capital for this company is 10%. You don't even think about growth rate. You might as well use a 0% growth rate. I wrote my first valuation book in the late 1980s. John Wiley was the publisher. And at the same time that my book came out, John Wiley also published a book by McKinsey. Some of you might have seen the McKinsey valuation book. It's widely used out there. So both the books are published by John. And the original McKinsey made that the terminal value? Because McKinsey also made an assumption that if you have a mature company, it cannot earn more than its cost of capital. The reasoning actually is impeccable. No company has barriers that last forever. So you're in perpetuity. I'm going to assume return on capital is equal to cost of capital. And if you make that assumption, guess what? It doesn't matter what growth rate you use. You might as well use a zero growth rate. But McKinsey's own research suggests that can be a dangerous assumption approach towards a growth-oriented economy. That's basically what we've said. When they looked at the returns on capital, they discovered that returns on capital are sticky. That you take a company like Coca-Cola, you track its returns on capital over time, they stay high, which means there are some companies, at least, where you can assume the return on capital is going to stay above the cost of capital. Why? Because they have strong and sustainable competitive values. If I'm adding a Ramco and I'm putting in a terminal value at the end of year 10's why I actually report return on capital and cost of capital by industry. So take a look at what those numbers look like. But technology companies are routinely leave the return capital above the cost of capital. Because it looks like even if you capitalize R&D that technology companies have this excess return that's long term. Now, sectors like automobiles, the entire sector earns less than the cost of capital. SoEx offsets depreciation in stable growth. Okay. So what's your net CapEx going to be? CapEx offsets depreciation. Net CapEx is zero. There are no working capital requirements. Okay. This is getting even better. Change in working capital is zero. This is another advantage of zero numbers, right? Zero plus zero is zero. And zero divided by any number is zero. So basically you end up with a reinvestment rate of revenues and my earnings, shouldn't I be assuming that that equipment is going to cost me more? In other words, I can't selectively look at inflation when I do my revenues and forget about the fact that inflation is going to... If that were not the case, When you get to stable growth, you're 10, you're 11, you're 15, you're 20, you're making your company a boring company, right? Boring company-wise, revenues have grown, it's margined some nice positive numbers. Hey, make it a boring company, give it the benefits of being a boring company. You think, what are the benefits of being a boring company? What's the biggest benefit of being a boring company? Risk should come down, you should be able to borrow money. Boring companies have lower costs of capital. I'm okay with that. But if your assumptions about revenue and margins come to fruition, you know what should happen to your cost of capital, it can't stay at 15%. It should converge on the cost of capital of a mature company. Here again, I'll tell you what's built in as a default into the spreadsheet. When you get a steady state, I push your cost of capital towards the average for the market, not even the average for the sector, because who knows what you'll diversify into. You can override it, So a company with $400 billion in revenues with a 20% margin, 20% of $400 billion is an $80 billion operating profit company. Make it one of the most profitable companies in the face of the earth. It's going to be very different than the company today. Yes? When you say that you always need to be reinvesting capital in a company, is that basically human? No, no. Did I say that? I said if you want growth, I said you need to reinvest. It's a statement that's conditioned. So you want to have no growth, then I'm okay. Don't reinvest in stable growth, there's something terribly wrong with your company because it needs to be self-sustaining by then. So last thing I want to do in intrinsic valuation is bring all the pieces together. So let's see the pieces we went through. Started with discount rates, right? Spent a lot of time on that. Then we went to cash flows, measuring free cash flow to the firm, you have only one choice. You can value only the equity. You can't value the operating assets of the bank. There's no such thing. So if you're not valuing a bank and you face this choice, it really becomes which is easier to do. So let's trace each one through. To value the equity in a company, I need free cash flows equity, right? Which is post-debt cash flows and the cost of equity that reflects the leverage in my company. most firms, you're going to feel either that there's a sense of direction, the debt ratio is low, it's going to go up as my company gets more mature, or it's too high, they have to bring it down to get to steady state, or you just don't know. You know it's changing, but you don't know in which direction. If that is the case, it's easier to work with free cash flow to the firm and value the firm than to value equity. Let's think about why. If you have a company where the debt ratio is low, it's going to increase over resistance. Why ought to be estimating three line items which are wasting my time? They really don't make that much of a difference to my bottom line in terms of value. Now, within the context of valuing equity, you have a choice of, you know, so you use equity valuation when leverage is stable, firm valuation when it's unstable. Within the context of equity valuation though, sorry, I can discount dividends I have no idea what the net capex and change in working capital is here. So let's see each fork of the road. Equity valuation or firm valuation. For most non-financial service companies, firm valuation is going to dominate equity valuation. Within equity valuation, dividends are free cash flow equity. Well, if you cannot estimate free cash flow equity, it's really not even a choice. You're going to go with dividends. But if you can, you're going to go with free cash flow equity. And that's always terrified me about banks. and real and nominal, it depends on what they did. So by the time you're done estimating the cash flows, the discount rates kind of pick themselves. You're valuing free cash flow to the firm, you use the cost of capital. So as you look at these choices, step back and say, hey, you know, ultimately I want to value for the equity. What's the most pragmatic way of getting there? Because it's not that one is right and the other is wrong. It's as some of these approaches take more work, especially when leverage is such. it's behaving like a mature company. What does that mean? It's not reinvesting huge amounts. If you're reinvesting huge amounts, for better or worse, you can't put it in as a mature company because it seems to believe that it can have growth, correctly or incorrectly. You're going to look at the reinvestment rate. You're going to look at the growth rate. You're going to look at the risk of the company. Everything has to convert. So if you have a company with a cost of capital close to that of the market, has a reinvestment rate, which is low reflecting the growth rate, and a growth rate less than economy. So here you can use what I call two-stage models. In two-stage models, what you do is you assume a 6% growth for the next five years. The end of year five, you move it to 4%. It's not much of a transition, so you can make it in two stages. the economy, even though you have a 10-year forecast, you're valued basically as a mature company. It's flexible enough. You can make it two-stage, three-stage, whatever you want to do. Essentially, those are the parameters that drive what your ultimate discounted cash flow valuation is. Yes? Why is 10% the benchmark for choosing between two-stage? I had to pick a number. You're looking at 8%. It has to be close enough to the risk-free rate that a drop is not going to shock somebody. a DCF model. So the Lego that you pick out at the cash flow box is a dividend Lego. Then the only Lego that will print from the discount rate part is the cost of equity Lego. I don't think they make Legos like this, and I might be violating some patent by using Lego. But basically, I'm saying when people claim they've invented a discounted cash flow model, the answer is, what do you invent here? It's a combination of cash flows, discount rates, and growth patterns. basic common sense and being consistent yes sir i've seen like models with like a fade rate that's what a transition period right it is right fade rate is basically my return on capital is 25 percent i think it's going to go to 10 percent i can't make it go from 25 to 10 in one step i'm going so fade rates are just a fancy word for you know and you know what the fade rate usually is right take linear increments every year so but'd like to talk about in the next stretch is what people do after they tell you they're done that can create real damage in valuation. So understand what the next part of the process is going to bring about. Do you guys know how academia works? I'll tell you, I have to work really hard, four and a half hours a week for like 38 weeks of the year. And they give me only like 17 weeks off. And 38 weeks would be going to write a paper write a bunch of papers do research and as I was approaching my sabbatical year at a singular objective I said I want to wake up for 365 days with nothing to do every day I'm going to do nothing in my sabbatical and I admit I must I got a little ostentatious about this whole process the first day of my sabbatical I go to staples and I buy one of these to-do list boards that you can get I stay at home obviously There's another item on my to-do list, pick up kids from school. And after about the third or fourth item, I said, I've got to find things to do to keep my wife off my list. I'm really desperate now. Give me something to do. And coincidentally, I get this email from the process of people adding premiums and discounts to a discounted cash flow value. Controlled premium of 20%, 25%. I said, if you do this, there's no point evaluation because you're going to back into whatever number you wanted by using, I might have used the word arbitrary to describe the premium? $100. I'm going to ask a question that I think is a provocative question. You have a company with $100 million in cash. Are there times or conditions where you might discount cash in the hands of a company? And if so, why? going to take you through and one of the things I want to talk about is this sudden surge in stock-based compensation. I'm going to talk about what do you do when you have management options? What do you do when you have restricted stock? Because people just mangle the process with what they're doing of your dividends come from the income from cash. It's giving you more safety. But the bottom line is we either deal with cash very simply, or we just let it slip into our valuations. So I'm going to show you three companies. And I'm going to ask you a question about these companies, which I think is going to make a difference. Second company, has a history of taking projects that earn a 5% return on capital. Its cost of capital is 10%. It's also a US company. Company C is an Argentine company. Its cost of capital is higher, but it's got really good returns on capital, 22%. I'm going to argue that in one of these three companies, cash is going to be a neutral asset. You know what I mean by neutral assets? What we it about being that terrifies you? They have a history of stupidity. You know what you're doing? You're attaching a stupidity discount. You're saying, it's not the cash that's going to hurt you. It's what these guys can do with the cash. And what have they shown a history of doing? Screwing it up big time. So you preemptively say, you guys will find a way to screw up the $100 million in cash. So you know what? I'll knock off 25%. again. But company C, you might attach a premium. Let's talk about why. If you go back to traditional corporate finance, no company ever needs a cash balance. You know why? Because if you have a great project, what do I assume you can do? Utopian corporate finance, you go out and raise capital. What's the big deal? Just raise the capital. Now do you see why I put company C in Argentina? Five times in the last 20 years, the Argentine capital market is audience pick companies see and I said why you can't trust these Argentines and it turned out that they lost a soccer game over the weekend or something there are other things boiling under the surface but the bottom line is in markets where and it's not just across markets right if I gave you a small company versus a large company or a private company versus a public company you can already see the implications small companies should build up more cash balances than larger company and argue that cash is a value destroying asset. What principle in corporate finance are they violating when they do that? Because then capital's cash is really value destroying. They're $150 billion. I guarantee you, they're not earning anything close to the cost of capital. Right now, they're earning probably 4.8% is the table rate. What's the rule in capital when you look at the discount rate for an asset, it should reflect the riskiness of that asset. point of what question they're asking, who should care. This paper actually looked at what a dollar in cash is valued in the hands of a company by the market. And the way they did this was they took all publicly traded companies, and they ran a very simple regression, market value against the cash balance, and they looked at the coefficient of the cash balance. So cash is valued in dollars, you should get a coefficient of roughly one on the cash balance. I'll give the damn cash back. You know how much they'll resist you? No, we've changed. Doesn't matter. Markets don't trust you. Give the cash back. The discount will disappear. But they will refuse. And that's where a call I can steps. All I can is a one trick point. Looks like you have too much cash. Give me the cash. How much value is that? You young companies, money-losing companies, to have a cash balance. Remember that failure rate that I asked you for your company? That failure rate is partly determined by how much cash you have. The day Paytm and Zomato and Airbnb did their IPOs, their failure rate dropped dramatically. You know why? Because they raised cash, they put it as a cash balance. They added $3 billion in cash. you've got a value in the company. But do you know what a closed-end mutual fund is? A typical mutual fund is an open-end fund, which means that if you send your money into Fidelity Magellan, the number of units in the fund increases, your net asset value is going to be whatever the value of the fund is divided by the number of units. So in an open-end fund, what the net asset value of your holding is is exactly equal to what the fund is invested in. A closed-end fund is 85% of the value, liquidate it, and keep the extra 15%. You can change it to an open-end fund and the discount should disappear. And there are some closed-end funds, 15% of funds, where that happens every year. But the other 85%, because of the way governance is set up, or taxes, because remember, you sell the stocks at, you don't get to keep the entire amount, you still have to pay taxes. There are frictions. And we know that if you look at the history of active money managers, they've had a tough time earning that required rate of return. The typical active money manager underperforms the index by about one and a half percent. So when you put your money in a closed-end fund, you know what you're doing, right? You're effectively saying, hey, you know, I'm going to make one and a half percent less than I should make. So if my cost of equity is 11 and a half percent, and I think you're going to make only 11 percent. Think of what that translates into. in funds, look at the history, look at the discount, I'll wager funds which have a history of underperforming are the ones that trade at the biggest discount. But if you're closed in funds, that beats the market. You know what you're going to do, right? If you expect it to keep beating the market, you're going to actually trade at a premium over there. And I'm going to use a company that you don't think of when you think of closed-end funds to illustrate this process. best regarded fund manager in history running the closed-end you know what this is going to create right what historically berkshire hathaway you look at the book value berkshire hathaway the reason for a long time berkshire hathaway used to report book value berkshire hathaway is just market value of companies so coca-cola it's mark to mark berkshire hathaway used to trade two and a half to three times book value used to tell people you buy berkshire hathaway you're introduction of the B-shares? That, I think nobody even, it was Buffett. He can do whatever he wants. People don't even think about it, the ulterior motive. So, I remember he introduced the B-shares. People said, oh, it's Buffett. He must have a good reason for doing it. It's not the buybacks which even... It's been big for a while, right? You're right. It's getting bigger. That scaling is working. There's probably a very Now, the Buffett premium is unique. You can't pass it on just because you say, I picked a good guy. It's just the age. There are lots of other issues. I think value investing itself has hit some crossroads. But what you're seeing there is a reflection of the expectation of there is no Buffett premium left because he's not going to be around for much longer. We think about personality-driven companies. We think about Musk and Tesla. But the reality is Berkshire Hathaway, What's a minority passive investment? You own 3%, 4%, 5% of a company, and you take no role in how the company is run. Basically, it's just a holding. You can have a minority active investment. You own 15% of a company. You have somebody in the board of directors. You have some role in how the company is run. Or you have a majority holding, where you own 60% of a company. You know how the accounting works? If you have a minority passive investment, all you have to show is the dividends you receive they originally invested for a $7 billion holding. Minority passive is uncommon. Thank God for that. But it's completely disconnected from reality. Then you have minority active holdings. Minority active holdings, you take a stake in the company, you have some role in how the company is running. You've got to use what's called the equity approach. This is the predominant approach that most companies do with cross holdings. and the account says don't worry about it you're operating income 100% of the operating income only 60% don't worry about it then you get to the assets you count 100% of the cash only 60% the accountant says don't worry about it then at the very end of the process the accountant wakes up and says you're only 60% I said that's what I've been trying to tell you all this time you don't own 40% genius we've got to show the 40% that doesn't. The first step in dealing with cross-holdings is going through the accounting and trying to figure out how exactly are these people estimating the value of cross-holding. And in a perfect world, let's talk about how you value cross-holdings. In a perfect world where you were doing things from scratch, here's what I would do. I'd value the parent company standing alone. Take out all the cross-holdings. It does require information. What's the information you need? You need information on your company's parent company's stats. Many multinationals would report both a parent and a consolidator, but some report only consolidator. You don't even have a choice. But you also need full financials on every subsidiary that you have. But here's the problem you're going to face. That's not going to be easy to get most companies. I am way too lazy. This is the kind of company I say, look, I'm not investing in the company. It's too much work to do. But let's say I'm not a lazy person that I'm willing to take the path of it. I couldn't have done it in this company for a simple reason. 60 of the 227 companies were publicly traded. So I could get the financials. The other 167 were private companies with zero information provided at any of the operating costs for revenues and operating income, nothing. So I called the investment relations officer about it for a moment. You have a point, but it's still proprietary. At this point, I'm banging my head against the wall. I'm ready to hang up the phone. She said, wait, I can tell you something about these crossholdings. I'm expecting something like revenues or operating. I said, what? She said, I cannot give you specifics, but they're worth a lot. I said, I'm sitting here with an Excel spreadsheet with a cell next to crossholdings. I'm, no, my cross-holdings are not worth zero. Here, I'll show you what they're worth. But as long as you say, I'll take whatever you show on your balance to the value of your cross-holdings, we're not going to get the information. But in a perfect world, let's see how this will work out. So this was a few years ago when Yahoo was still an operating company. If you remember 2013, 14, it was towards the end of its life. Marissa Meyer had just come in as CEO. 2014, as you know, Alibaba went public as a $200 billion company. So I valued each piece separately. And I was able to do this because Yahoo was a standalone company. I was able to get the parent numbers. Yahoo Japan was a standalone Japanese list. I was able to. And this was right after Alibaba filed for their IPO. So the prospectus was up. So I did an intrinsic valuation of each of the three companies. So I'm valuing three companies to get the value of one. So each one, I value the operating assets. I had cash subtracted. That's Yahoo's. intrinsic valuation all the way through. I'm valuing the parent company and valuing the subsidiary, but I'm able to do it because I have the financials. This is the exception, not the rule. Most of the time, you're going to be able to get only some of the information. You get the parent company, but not the subsidiaries. The question is, what do we do in the limited information that we have? And I'll give you two choices. One is every single time. So the fact is when you look at these companies and you try to value them, you've got to work with the information you have. And with Yahoo, I actually did a pricing alternative. So here's what the pricing alternative looks like. Rather than do an intrinsic valuation of each part, I applied a multiple in each part. So I used EV to sales for each of the companies and adjusted for the fact that growth was different. stuck, at least you know what you're stuck on. You can think about what to do when you get back. Have a great break. I will see you when you come back on Monday. I will give you a break on emails. My last email will come on Friday. For a whole week, you will not hear from me. I promise you. Wait for the email a week from Friday because we'll be back. I've got no other friends. I'm going to miss them. One question. When I came to your office, are you that is if you assume that infection will go up created 8% inflation for the next session. Let's see if I want to do it. I'm going to project that. So it's got nothing to do with what you project as the inflation rate. It's what we switch into the rate that you use in growth rate. You can assume low inflation. You can assume deflation. You can assume high inflation. As long as both those numbers reflect that, really not going to move higher just because the price has gone up because of the inflation. Right. What do you think? What they're telling you is that there are closed end fund arbitrage. There are like 20% closed end funds every year are targeted for unclosing, you know, liquidation. Exactly. on the property the problem there is liquidating the assets is going to be really difficult to do so you can buy the fund but then you're not selling stocks you're actually selling real estate properties that you think are worth more than what you paid but if five properties are in the same city then you're trying to sell them all at the same time who knows what kind of discount you'll have to get but it is a constant push and... Then all I would say is, okay, they're hypocritical. Do not. Don't try too hard. I'm serious. Okay. Not because... Let's say it's an insurance company's core value comes from the insurance business. Yes. Okay? The Berkshire Hathaway is an exception to that rule. Yes. I think when insurance companies get hurt, So I think my advice is, remember, it's an insurance company fundamentally, and your job is to preserve those premiums first. It's very much of a preserved premium, and you want to, of course, deliver solid returns. And if you can make plenty of basis points more than market, you're a hero. That's the hope. I hope to get my offer by the end of the month. We shall see. Good luck to you. Okay. you you you you you",
