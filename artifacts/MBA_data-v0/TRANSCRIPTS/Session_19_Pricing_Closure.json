{"text": " you So today I sat up that email and I've been dying to read it. I live without email, but I'd send it out today. It actually is an email about the valuation, the pricing of the week, and really about the statistics of pricing. So if you want to take a look at all the statistics, take a look at it. We designed your own. when you use a multiple. So I'm going to stay with the conventional practice of calling everything valuation. You've done a discounted cash flow valuation. You come up with $10 per share. The stock is trading at 15. So if I stop right there, it's a no brainer, see? I want to buy that company. But then you do a pricing for your company against the software sector, which is where it is. And you come up with a pricing of 20. So you see the challenge you face? What's the final thing you have to do on your project? what do you think about that idea you had the 20 plus the 10 divided by 2 you get 15 right this is like saying i'll be a muslim for the first half of the day and a christian for the second half it doesn't end well because somewhere along the way you have to make choices never ever mix a pricing with evaluation you know how many ipos i see where people do this the banker would say i bet we've used four different approaches to valuation when you have a sector in a bubble, that's exactly what happens, right? When you price your company against other software companies, you're asking a very different question than when you're valuing a company. You're valuing a company and saying, given the fundamentals of this company, is this company cheap or expensive? When you're pricing a different than the pricing you got against the sector. So, even within pricing, depending on, you know, what the comparison is, you can end up with very different conclusions. So, remember that about pricing, you're asking and answering a very specific question that's conditional to what you're comparing your company to, and a predictable enough reversion to actually make money on it. So let's turn back to slide 55, I think, 56. So if you remember last session, I'll be quite honest,, right? If I ask you, what's the driver of EB to EBIT, you should be able to do the algebra. If I ask you, what's the driver for EB to user? So if any of you are in that space of user-based companies, try this out. It's a very good way to come up with a list of questions to ask a user-based company about what the value of a user is. So today, I want to move to the next phase. We've definedflow. So implicitly we're hoping, we're praying that companies within a sector are similar enough that we can compare. Are they though? 50 years ago, we didn't see your companies. They all look roughly the same. It's roughly the same stage in cycles. Today, if you do utilities, they're roughly in the same stage of the cycle. You take software companies today. You've got Microsoft in there. You've got Adobe in there. You've got startup software companies in there. companies, but maybe start to rethink what we mean when we look at comparable firms. But even if you do everything right, and after you've gotten the list of comparable firms, you're going to face a challenge, which is those companies have differences from your company, higher growth or lower risk. We need to figure out a way to control for those differences. You know how equity research analysts do it right now. old screen. Thank you. So let's talk about the sample that you're going to draw. So those of you who haven't accessed SLP Capital IQ yet, you haven't needed it for intrinsic valuation, but in pricing, it's going to be incredibly useful. dollar plus company. I'm going to look for only building retail with a market gap greater than 100 billion. This is good, right? And then you look at what comes through your screen and it gives you one company. And you look at the company, it says Home Depot. This is not getting you very far. So you see where this is going. When you first start the screen, you want to find companies just like your company, same market gap, yours. But if you're willing to use statistical tools, four companies are not going to do it. You want to go to the large. So you might try both. You might do a small sample, which you want to use to eyeball the data to price it. But you also might want to use a larger sample that captures differences across companies. But that's always a trade-off. The, you can make judgments based on the three companies. So think of that as a first, you do direct comparisons of GM to Ford and you create rules. Again, through much of the 20th century, auto analysts had rules. GM trades at a PE ratio about 25% higher than Ford. For much of the 20G ratio. Just be careful though, because when you brought growth into the ratio, remember you didn't create this clean multiple. You created a multiple that didn't quite control for growth and ended up creating more problems than health. And finally, you can use statistics. In what way? You can have 500 companies in your sample, right? What are you worried about? Growth, risk, leave intrinsic valuation, you enter pricing. The way you measure risk can be completely your choice. So with the bank, you see me looking at tier one capital ratios. So whatever you think is the best measure of risk in a sector is what you're going to bring into the game. So really, this is my sector. I'm going to put out by recommendations on three companies. The growth rates are the lowest in the sector. So it's low growth. What about, hence, and naturally it looks, I mean, think of a peg ratio, right? 9.7 divided by 17. What's the problem there? Look at the standard deviation, the highest risk. Again, I'm not trying to explain things away, but I'm saying in this case, the pushback you would have is they look cheap, but go ahead. Or stock prices. But I could have used standard deviation in earnings if you felt that was a better measure of risk. So pick up any sector, look down and see if you can see an obvious reason why a stock trades at the lowest price to book or the lowest EV to sales and it's usually going to stick up. I get fired as a beverage analyst after that buy recommendation went out. I land on my feet. I'm now the telecom ADR analyst. Let me give you some perspective. Cheaper stocks, you can see where I'm going to go. I'm going to go to Indosat and Telebras because they have the lowest P ratios. These are all telecom ADRs. But if you go down the list, you notice that some of them are emerging market telecom ADRs. Remember, in the 1990s, emerging markets were really emerging markets. And the divide between developing and emerging markets was huge. And some are, you've got the Danish telecom company, the British telecom company. There's a growth rate. So basically that captures the growth effect. How do I read the 121? For every 1% difference in growth across these telecom companies, the PE increases by 1.21. So if your company has a 5% higher growth rate than mine, I'd expect your PE ratio to be roughly six higher than mine, five times 1.21. You're saying, what is this? This is a dummy variable. You know what a dummy variable is? It country risk. Pricing in country risk. As opposed to what an intrinsic valuation would have built it as a big risk premium, had a higher discount rate. Here we're saying, no, we can't do that. We are going to let the market tell us how much it's discounted. Now, is there the problem with zero one is I'm treating all. So in a sense, you're saying high inflation countries with low inflation countries. I could have, but in the sense the I'm doing it all in dollars in the US, I'm not doing it in different currencies. So if I'd done them by pulling PE ratios from localized markets, I'd have had to deal with inflation and interest rates. But here I didn't have mean, it might be personal. I feel much more comfortable with my pricing when I do this than when I tell a story and I go on the one. Because at the end of the storytelling, I say, I have no idea what I'm talking about anymore. I can give a sense of direction. But unless you have something so obviously mispriced, you're kind of stuck. So I'm not saying statistics should replace you doing things, but it's a tool. It's a tool that lets you control for differences on Telebras and Indosat and that money blew up. I land on my feet again. Now I'm the European banking analyst. I pull all the numbers down for European banks. And banks are particularly either susceptible to price to book ratios, because the book value for a bank actually means something, right? Because it's driven by regulatory capital and everything's mark to market. So there are the price to book ratios for the banks. I put that in, that becomes a proxy for how much should I worry about an SVB like blow up at this bank? So look across and think about what to do with the numbers. So first, I'm going to do a low tech way in which you find cheap companies. So help me out here. You want a low return, low price to book rate ratio in your company, right? You can do this and unless something sticks out, obviously, which very seldom happens, you get cool out of three and you say, well, is that good enough? So again, I went back to my statistics rulebook and you can see why desperation drives you back to statistics because I've given up this larger sample and the investors are pricing in exposure at banks into the pricing of banks i don't know the only way to check is to check the data so i get the r squared is 79 percent tells me that at least in this sector i'm able to explain a very high percentage of differences in price to book with return you're saying what if i have a sector where the lower R-squared, you just get bigger ranges. So here's what I did. I took my sample and I used my regression to get predicted price to book ratios. Just like I did for the country piece. that might be pushing the limits of what he can get away with. So we've looked at beverages. We've looked at telecom ADRs. We've looked at banks. Yes? Does that R-squared indicate the influence of both? Yeah. R-squared and T-statistics go together, right? When you get high R-squared, you get high T-statistics. It's so impossible to get a high R-squared. And low T-statistics, it'll never come through there. They're all linked together, right? Because think of what we're doing here. We're taking actual points. We're taking a predicted point. We're looking at the difference between your prediction and your actual. So that's a residual. When the residuals are all zero, you get an R squared of 100%. So think of both as output from your data. Neither drives the regression. They're coming out of the data that you put in and what the link is and how strong that linkage is. And with a sample of P, it's not too large. So the standard is like... The more variables I let you throw into regression, the higher your R squared will get because you're throwing in more stuff. But if you have a small sample, you've got to get really, that becomes really dangerous. With a sample of 18, most I can get away with this too, independent variables. If I throw in a third one, strange things will start happening. I might get a great looking regression, but it's not going to work. So here's my suggestion. you try and you both the sample and your regression you might have to do two or three iterations before you converge on something that works for you and there will be some of you who will find none of the regressions work as I said you can't fight the data in which case what should you do just compare to the average in the industry and say thank god I'm not pricing remember you get to decide which one you're going to base your recommendation on and if you do this in a statistics package and you do a scatterplot, almost every scatterplot in a package that I see asks you a question. Do you want me to put a best fit line through those points? Which is really a regression line. Say yes. Cost is nothing. Let it do it. you to think about because no first choice you think there must be overvalued undervalued but before i do you do that i want you to ask is there something we could be missing because all i'm doing is looking at price to book versus return equity right at the above the lines are these my over valued undervalued stocks overprice i'm sorry overpriced underpriced they're my overpriced i've google infosys and galliard gillian was a young growth pharmaceutical company doing its phone business was dying conoco and exxon mobil again your antenna should start they're both oil companies and when you get two companies from the same sector looking undervalued they might be undervalued but the oil companies remember you take price to book and return equity you're looking at net income in the most recent year and if oil prices surge during the year companies may look cheap it looks like i'm just explaining away the difference with the 100 largest market cap let's start with price to book you want low price to book high price to book you want low price to book you want high return equity low return equity high return equity and you want high growth or low growth so basically you want low price to book high return equity hey you're looking somewhere in here right that's where your cheapest stocks would be there's nothing there the closest i get is time warner and whether you get some kind of investment judgment coming out. Yes. It's a good point. Let's say you take companies with intangibles. What happens to their book value? They're good. Too low or too high? They're going to have too low a book value. So the price-to-book ratios are going to be high. That same book value, though, that low book value, what is it going to do to your return equity? Exactly. So in a sense, you can say, what is the market doing? So I think the other alternative is to capitalize R&D. But the reason we do pricing is we don't book return equity risk and growth a four-dimensional graph there's a way to do it you get like 12 scatter plots don't even go there i mean just it looks impressive you know but if you're trying to make investment judgments it's just going to make you dizzy yeah and finally i took those 100 companies and while i cannot do a four-dimensional That pushes up the R squared. Let's leave that in there. And if your end game is explaining things away because you threw in variables, that's not my end game. Because I want to leave things that are not because of fundamentals unexplained, because that's where my money comes from. Saying, why am I paying a higher P-E ratio for a company after I have control for the fact that there's less risk and higher growth and a higher return equity? I mean, if you really care about risk and bringing that in the right way, just stick with intrinsic valuation. Pricing is what it is. If you rerun this question today, do you expect the record base to matter more? It could be, but the 100 largest market cap, I might still be stuck with this fact that there, percentage difference becomes a rough measure of what you will make as an excess return if you buy the stock at the lower price to book. And what happens? The market agrees with your regression and decides to move everything to your predicted value. Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to make markets do that yet, but that part, so it becomes a return once you act on it and you find stocks that trade low price earnings or low price to book. The question is, are they overvalued or undervalued enough that you can statistically point to them? It could be a one person hedge fund, right? Tell me what you would do if this was the tool in your hand. Buy the undervalued. But what makes for a hedge fund? You can also short the overvalued. Then you get down on your knees and you pray and hope that they all move to the regression line. Because then no matter what happens to the market right you can get the convergence right who cares what the value of something is and how it plays out over time that's i think 90 confidence interval so basically it allows you most statistics package will ask you whether I'm now the trucking analyst. I'm moving down into the most boring sector in the world. So this is my trucking sector. There's my EB to EBITDA multiple for these sectors. Again, remind me, EB to EBITDA is low, is cheap. So I'm going to put out a buy recommendation. I picked Rider Systems. Why not KLLM? I don't even know what KLLM does. variable we talked about with EV debit, because it's a pre-tax number. We asked about the tax rate. You don't have to know what the tax rate is, but again, if I could show you the effective tax rates, they all look the same. So it's not the growth. It's not the tax rate. I looked at the return on capital, hoping that, you know, this company had a really low return on capital. That explains it away. It wasn't return on capital, which brought me to $7 billion. This was actually, I pulled it off an actual equity research report. It said, buy riders cheap EBITDA. And I actually went through the annual reports of trucking companies. They actually report the age of their fleet. All I had to do was add'm getting used to getting fired. I get fired as the trucking analyst. I'm now the grocery store business. Talk about boring to even more boring, right? Characterized grocery store business in the U.S. by Whole Foods because it was very different from everybody else, right? Why is that this much higher margin strategy, higher price strategy? And their initial reaction was, this stock is massively over, you know, but then they tried to explain away, but it has a high margin, therefore it's okay. So 2007, when I first looked at Whole Foods, I looked at that, then I'm going to stick with price to sales. I know it's not internally, I think it falls close to the line, right? There's back to being overpriced. 2007, 2008. It's almost like watching a manic. It's really a manic depressive stock, right? There's no middle ground. why I keep valuing Tesla every year. I get a whole lot of abuse for doing it, but to me it's a stock that will take a while to get it right, especially if you had a CEO who kind of distracts you along the way, that kind of adds to the mispricing. By 2012, markets had learned how to price Whole Foods. And then 2015, I take a something works, right? To explain the price. So you get ready, you're going to do your pricing. You're sure you're going to get a regression with a 60% R squared. And as nice regression, you plug the numbers in. You put a scatterplot. It's actually in 2000. Remember the Amazon valuation I showed you? At the same time, I decided to price Amazon. By looking at other dot-com companies, I did a scatterplot of price to sales against net profit margin. And even scarier, you look at the coefficient on the net margin. It's negative. How would I read it? The more negative your margin, the higher your price to sales ratio. I think a few dot-com companies took this to heart. You lost money, we can lose even more. You lost a billion, we can lose two. It sounds absurd, but it reflects the fact that this is a young business. Nobody is pricing companies based on what they made last year. What are they pricing these companies on? When I looked at dot-com companies in 2000, I said, they're not looking at margins last year. They want high growth companies over low growth companies. So I threw in a revenue growth. I also factored in the scaling effect, which is if you're a million-dollar company, you can trade at 100 times revenues. And some of these dot-com companies did. But as they get bigger, you can't keep trading at 100 times revenues because your base gets much bigger. So I threw in the level of revenue. regression, I got an R squared of 32%. I was ecstatic. In this sector, if I can explain 32% of the pricing, I am way better than what I expected. If you look at the T statistics, it turned out that the scaling effect was actually weaker than I thought it was. I might as well take that out of the regression. down 95%. You won. You lost less. And that's the thing about winning and pricing. Winning and pricing doesn't mean you make money. It just means that you lost less money than everybody else. And if you're judged on a prediction then because more things are going to fall outside. The second is to do what's called forward pricing. This is what every VC does, right? What's a forward pricing? What's the trouble you're having with these companies right now? There's not much substance, not much in revenues, not much in the earnings are negative. billion in year 10. Remember, you're buying the stock today, right? Well, part of you says, I'm just going to discount the 150 billion back today. That's a stock, at least considering time value money. But think of what else you're not factoring in. What else is missing if you just discount the forward price back today to discount rate? Are all these young money losing companies going to make it to year 10? That failure rate. Remember And my value today was about 8 billion. People say, where did all that money go? So I actually took my terminal value and actually started working backwards. This is how much you lost for pure time value of money. This is how much you lost for risk. Because if you think about what you charge above the risk-free rate, this is how much you lost because there was dilution. So what I'm trying to say in a kind of, actually, I can do it. And what I'm saying is, when you're doing pricing, this all happens implicitly. And this is what terrifies me. When people use forward pricing of young companies, they wave their hands, even if they're... But if you ask them, how much is the dilution going to affect me? They can't answer that because without doing the cash flows and thinking about the time, you cannot really answer those questions. You think, is that okay? If the market is pricing users, that's what driving, and your job is to price companies. Guess what? You've got to follow the script. In 2013, when Twitter went public, I did a discarded cash flow evaluation of Twitter. It's on my website. In fact, I reposted it two years ago, a year ago, when Elon targeted Twitter. I put the original valuation. And I priced Twitter. platforms used. I was completely agnostic. I'd say, I'm going to let the market tell me what it's pricing in. How are you going to answer the question? If I wanted to answer the question, what is the market caring about the most? What's the statistical tool I'm going to call on first? I want to see what drives market cap or enterprise value. I did a correlation matrix. I said, tell me what you correlated with. I don't to, you know, and this is how the pricing worked. So at about $100 per user, Twitter had 240 million users on the date of their IPO. So guess what my initial pricing for Twitter was? I took 240 multiplied by 100, which gave me 24 or how much I pay for the company or how quickly the adjustment will happen. So even if you don't like the fact that markets price companies based on users and downloads and subscribers, if it does, it's good to know what that process looks like. So take a look at those seven examples from the beverage thing where I wave my hands all the way to the users and kind of, you know, you get a sense of what pricing is. companies. But if I control for differences in growth, risk, and return equity, I should be able to compare. And if there are differences, I cannot explain away. That tells me that there are some segments of the market that are being mispriced relatively simply because people are taking a sector and overpricing it or underpricing. So I decided to do this when the first time I decided to do this, before I ran the regression, I wanted got an R-squared of 25%. I was actually pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a lower R-squared. 25% of variation in PE ratios across all US stocks can be explained by growth, bait, and payout ratio. Again, I'm not doing a kitchen sink regression. I'm staying in all three variables r squared of 25 percent i don't know how much you remember when you about linear regressions in statistics but when you run linear regressions the first question you're always asked is is this okay it's a relationship non-linear they I remember listening to this and saying, who the hell cares? I should have listened better. What are my three variables in my regression? Payout, growth, and beta. There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that these are going to be uncorrelated with each other. Why? High growth stocks will tend to have low payout ratios and high betas. head. It's just data. If your high growth companies all tend to have high betas, you blame the computer if it gets confused about what beta is measuring at some point in time. In fact, beta here is becoming a better proxy for growth than it is a proxy for risk. And in the regression, what you're getting is two variables measuring growth. One called growth and the other called beta. And there is the explanation for the positive coefficient. But if you do, when you price companies, it can create a problem. Let's say you get a negative intercept of minus 10. I've actually run regression of the negative intercept of minus 10. And then you start to predict PE ratios starting with minus 10. You can end up with a predicted PE of minus 2, right? but in return you get zero intercepts. So if you have an intercept that's creating trouble, you can rerun the regression through zero and that effectively will give you, take care of the problem. It'll give you a less robust regression, but one that's more usable. And finally, here's the correlation matrix that I put. So if this were a perfect regression, you know what this matrix should look like do all of that, you end up with these convoluted, complex regressions that you can't explain intuitively to people. So here's the end game though. You're saying, why am I running this regression? Because I want to price stocks. If I came to you with a stock like Disney and say, hey, and then look at the 10 most underpriced and the 10 most overpriced. And if your basic regression is sound, hope that they can start to move towards your regression line. So if you go to my website, I mean, this is, I don't want any of you the growth rate was 0.462. Think of that. Remember I talked about the equity risk premium is the price of risk in the market. The coefficient you see on growth is how much the market is willing to pay for a 1% growth rate. your worst case scenario with that company is the equity risk premium soars and the price of growth drops off because now you're not getting paid much for growth you're getting punished for being risky 2023 look closer to that at the start of 2023 it's improved sets so if i re-ran this regression now my guess is the growth coefficient has gone up market seems to be willing to pay for growth again but we started this year with the market saying hey", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 85.65], "text": " you So today I sat up that email and I've been dying to read it.
