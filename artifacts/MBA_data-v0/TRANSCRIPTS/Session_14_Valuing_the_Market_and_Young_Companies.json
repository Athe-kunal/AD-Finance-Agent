  "text": " it is that long-term potential problems that we're talking about in the context of the pandemic. Thank you. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you know what's coming up next Monday, right? You have no idea. Second quiz is next Monday. You have no time. If you've been working on your DCF project, you've in a sense been working on them, the bulk of what the next quiz is going to be, which is everything from growth to all the mechanics of valuation. So your next quiz is next Monday. And then I looked at 3M and how a crisis can change your valuation for a company, even though none of the numbers change. So today I'm going to continue with that. I'm going to talk about valuing the S&P 500, and then I'm going to go off into the deep end. We're going to embark on what I call the dark side of valuation. Sounds mysterious. It's about difficulty to value companies. But today I want to start with a couple of questions. One is very closely related to what you're wrong and the market is right. If that's where you end up, essentially, that's where you end up because you know where the end game then is, right? At the end of this class, this will be the last valuation you ever do. And you're going to put your money in index funds. And you're saying, why am I wasting my time choice that's off the table, but you can both be wrong. And you say, please, God, let me be a little less wrong than the market. That's what we're hoping for. So don't put the weight of the world on your shoulders. And at the end of your evaluation, how do I know I'm right? Because you're not going to be right. You're going to be wrong, but you brought down the temperature and said, no, I don't have to be right. I just have to be less wrong. revenues, it's in your margin, but I'm asking about that negative 1 billion in free cash flow you get in year one. To get to year two, and to get all of your future, your nirvana to come through, what are we implicitly assuming? That capital is coming into the firm. Are we assuming some mix of capital? You are, right? And your cost of capital, you tell me your debt is 5%, your equity is 95%. You're implicitly telling me you're going to raise asked, why aren't you adjusting your share count for the fact that you will have to issue new shares in the future via young company? And there will be the notion, why are you not doing? But that doesn't fully answer the question. You still have to ask, the value is based on your forecast for the future. So if you're projecting everything else in the future, shouldn't you also be factoring in the increased share count you will have? year one, year two, year three, it's already in there. And people say, where? Here's the simplest way to show it. Compute the value without those negative cash flows in the first three years. Compute the value that you got with the negative cash flows. You're going to get about, I'm going to do Amazon today in 2000. I'll get a value about 20% lower because I counted the negative cash flows. That's the dilution effect cash balance. And then if you have a negative cash flow and you have seven, you have to come up with the whole process again. Now, in practical terms, what the company would probably do is they will not give you the cash flow, in which case your effective cash flow will be zero in that positive cash flow year. They keep the cash flow to cover the negative cash flow because it's more practical. You save an issuance cost. But that's always this open question. What if a year from now I'm unable to raise capital? You see how that can happen? We're right now in a VC freeze. Let's talk about how Silicon Valley Bank is going to make it even worse. You're a young company. What did you assume. You guys are going to fall asleep here. I'm noticing a hangover. I'm sorry And if I wanted to do this the long way, I could compute the free cash flow to the firm for each of the companies, add them all up. But that's going to be tedious and incredibly messy because they have different growth patterns, mature companies, growth companies. So I'm going to cheat. Here's what I'm going to do to value the index. This was in September 20th of 2022, but I have an updated version from January 1st, 2023, which you can bring up to try. So let's start. To value the index on a discounted cash flow basis, I need expected future cash flows, right? I could go the full route and compute free cash flow to the firm for the entire index, but it's messy because I have banks in there, I have underestimating the cash flows equity investors collectively receive from companies. Because if you look at 2022, I think two-thirds of the cash flows returned took the form of buybacks. So what I started with was dividends and buybacks in the most recent year. And the question I have to ask is, what will those numbers look like in to be. So I want to start with that question. Second, I wanted to also think about what inflation would do to my discard rate. We know as inflation goes up, interest rates go up. But we also know that as inflation goes up, the uncertainty about inflation increases, risk premiums go up. So the three big questions were, The reason index units are different from what you look at at billions of dollars is you have to convert it all into the same number of units of the index, the S&P 500 is at whatever, you know, 3,875, then everything has to be converted from whatever the actual dollar value is to those units. So 225.3 is the expected earnings in 2022, 24 I went from January 2022 to September of 2022, were analysts getting more pessimistic about future earnings as talk of a recession went up? You can decide for yourself, but if there's an effective recession on these expected earnings, you can hardly see it. It's almost like analysts live in a different universe than macroeconomists are forecasting recessions. I'm sorry, it was 77%. But as you go through time, you can see there are years in which that number has exceeded 100%. And on average, across those 22 years, you get about 80% to 85% of cash flows being returned to investors. Again, you can say that's too high, that's too low, but that's what the pattern of effect into 2023 or into the following year as the recession wanes. So my earnings numbers are going to be lower than the analyst estimates because I think a recession will damage those earnings more than analysts are forecasting. You might look at the same numbers and come up with an even bigger cut if you feel the recession is going to be deeper or nothing at all if you feel there's going to be no recession. For the felt the bulk of the inflation had already been built in. So I left the T-bond rates pretty close to where they were in September 2022. And finally, if you look at the equity risk premium, the equity risk premium, I use this framework to compute an implied premium. Here I get to make a judgment on premiums. Because if you just use the implied premium, you know what you're going to find, right? So when you're forecasting a recession, what are you doing in five years to the terminal year? To the terminal year, okay, at that point, we're not expecting COVID. You're smoothing out because there you're using a growth rate equal to the risk-free rate, which means there'll be recovery years after that year, recession years. And because you're not able to forecast when, that's why when people look at my terminal growth rate, they complain that it's too low. I say it looks too low because you're thinking about good years, but there will be bad years. the index value as I got. And you know why, right? Because people always think about analysts driving the market. If analyst numbers, if I did not build in that drop of 15% in earnings, I would actually ended up with 3,800 as my valuation. You know what this tells me? Markets have their own views about earnings. I have a feeling that you're going to see this band play out through the course of this year because nobody really knows what the end result here is going to be. But inflation and the economy, in spite of the banking crisis, because I want to know whether the collective response to SVB has kind of made banks collectively undervalued. There I'm willing to take a stand on my valuation because we know what panic does to sectors. So maybe backing out what the fair value of the banking index is with reasonable numbers about what this will mean can be a good way to get past the smoke and the noise that's been thrown up because of the banking crisis. that best fits your story. And you should probably act consistent with that story then, because your story and numbers will match up. So now let's move to what I think is the real reason for even spending a class in valuation. I'm going to call this a dark side evaluation. It's the title of one of my books, and I'll give you a history of how I picked that title. the current earnings, the current cash flows. The second question might be the most difficult question to answer in valuation is what is the value that is added or destroyed by future growth? Notice how I phrased that. I didn't ask you what's your future growth because we know growth has a good side and a bad side. The good side of growth is it makes your revenues and earnings higher. The bad side of growth is you have to reinvest to get that growth. The net effect can be positive to evaluate. So I'll start by making an obvious statement. When those questions are easy to answer, valuation becomes easy. So if you're valuing a company with a long history, Con Ed, why are those questions easy to answer? Because it doesn't have a whole lot of competition. It's got a long history. It's a regulated attorney. Each of those questions becomes easy to answer. If every company you valued was like Con around, right? R&D has to be capitalized. All the numbers have to be restated. And finally, if you have a company with significant truncation risk, what's truncation risk? Well, normally when you think about cash flows, you think about being wrong. Your year three cash flows are wrong, right? You know what truncation risk is? Will there be a year three? That risk is difficult to incorporate restructuring, but they're going to change their business model because the history no longer is useful. And declining companies are downright depressing to value because you're asked to do things that don't come naturally, putting a negative revenue growth rate, margins that decrease over time. It goes against human nature to be that pessimistic, but you have to be. So we're going to talk about those three groups, why I used to say banks are the easiest of all companies to value pre-2008, what happened in 2008 to change my mind, how I changed the way I valued companies after 2008, and how 2022 might cause more changes in the way we value banks. I want to talk a little bit about commodity and cyclical companies, what makes them different, Why we bother doing it? You're going to see the shift in value you get when you do the right thing. So let's start with young companies. I'm going to make you an entrepreneur. You've started a new business. Lots of prompts. And you've asked me to value your company. So I come in ready with my four questions. Ready? So the first question I ask you is, what are your cash flows from existing assets? What's your answer going to be? What existing assets? I don't even own the chair I sit in. That was easy. companies. I've never met a VC who can sensibly value something, but that doesn't seem to matter, right? You price things, you sell it to a higher price. You're a successful VC. So let's talk about making this even more challenging. So young companies are difficult to value, but they get even more difficult to value if you're in a sector where every other company looks just like you. All young companies, all money losing, all with small revenues, Every company looks just like yours. You're learning nothing from the industry averages. You have no financials, no history, no comparables. This is the trifecta you want to avoid in valuation because in a sense, you're in a nightmare scenario. And when you're in this scenario, the dark side will beckon. You know what the dark side will say? Things like, technology, you don't have the kinds of booms and buzz here with manufacturing. It sounded credible in 1999 as markets were booming. Paradigm shifts. Second, whenever you ask somebody about a company, rather than talk about the company, they talk about macro stuff. Why should I buy Rivian? Electric cars. Everybody's going to have electric cars. And for those of you not familiar with Alibaba, Alibaba pulled off an amazing feat. It beat Amazon head to head in China. And essentially, it beat all commerce. Because in 2002 or 2003, it was a tiny company. So in 2014, it went public. And at the time of the IPO, one of the biggest IPOs of all time happening on the NASDAQ, I decided to value the company. So it's still on my blog if you want to go check it out. So I valued it. And I called it the China story. open the Taobao page, which is the entry point. You'll have to wear sunglasses, right? You get hit with 15,000 things coming at you at the same time. And I think the perfect description for what Alibaba did to succeed was what the economists called them in 2014. They called them the online bazaar. You guys ever put in a 25 growth rate which was what the chinese are because and also 75 of all online retail traffic in china close you know It's $165 billion. That time, the highest value I'd ever attached to a company going public. So I come up with that value. CNBC calls me and says, Alibaba is going public in a couple of days. Would you come in and talk about Alibaba? And I say, yes. Bad mistake. I show up. They put me in a green room. I don't even know why they call it a green room. It's neither green nor a room, but it must be some carryover from some history. And I'm sitting there waiting to go on. And this guy comes in. I recognize him as an equity research analyst. But you can't use that as an explanation for any value. But that's the dark side. Use a big story to justify whatever you pay. And finally, you see metrics in these companies you've never seen before. The dot-com bull. For the first time, investors were dealing with young companies, money-losing companies, small revenues. None of the traditional metrics work. You know what I mean by metrics? you say that sounds high right because you have some frame of reference typical company trades are 20 times on how about 500 times revenues you're saying that sounds like a high number if i asked you to pay 300 per eyeball you're saying i like my eyeballs 300 doesn't sound like much you have no frame of reference when you have no frame of reference you can pay absurd prices and not even recognize it and they'd give me this look of total contempt and say, academic, and walk away. It's not meant as a compliment. Basically, academic basically meant you really can't value these companies. You can just talk about them. Talked about the fifth or sixth term of being called an academic. I got pissed off. I said, you know what? I'm going to value Amazon.com. 1997, I sat down to value Amazon. And here's what I ran into very quickly. website. It's called the dark side evaluation. Can amazon.com be bad? The answer is, give it away. Yes, but you'll have to get all over all of these roadblocks. So what I'm going to do is take you back not to 1997, but to 2000, January 2000. And the reason I picked January 2000, it's the peak of the dot-com boom. Amazon is the poster child for value them. I said, yes. So I'll give you a compressed version of that web cache. So you're setting the table. At the time of this valuation, Amazon had revenues of $1.1 billion. Let me pause right there. A U.S. retail company with a billion dollars in revenues, big or small? Let out and stay simplistic. What has to happen to the small revenues over time for it to become valuable? They've got to become big revenues. What do I need for that? Revenue growth is my mechanism for getting from small to good. What's going to happen to the losses? Not just reduced, but they've changed sign, right? Otherwise you're stuck. So the losses have to become profits. So what do I need? I need a revenues? I'm starting with a billion. I'm making it 40 billion. I'm increasing your revenues 40 fold over the next 10 years. And you're accusing me of being pessimistic. You know why it sounded pessimistic, right? What are they comparing the 42% to? Revenue growth in the most recent year for Amazon was 200%. The%. You're saying, where do you get the 10%? That was the 75th percentile of operating margins for retail companies in 2000. Not online retail companies. You know why not? They were all losing money. I assumed that over time, So I said, if you're a consumer, this is great. It means you have two places to go to buy everything. In the long term, I'm's perhaps better to build off and make sure that the revenues you're giving them are not out of sync with what the total market looks like. So the total market will come into play, but it'll come into play when I check, what should I use 42% or 55% of 30%. So it's implicitly there, just not explicitly there. for Amazon in 2000? Big negative number. What does the reinvestment rate look like? Big negative number. You think this is very convenient. Big negative number times big negative number gives me a big positive number. But what the heck is a big positive number applied on a loss going to do? Just make the losses bigger. I took the capex and depreciation the most recent year and tried to do financial modeling. Disaster, right? Because depending on your base year, it can do good things or bad things. You can let it. We're generating his revenues per dollar of investment capital. Here again, the pushback was, shouldn't online retailers be more efficient because they don't need brick and mortar? They don't need brick and mortar stores, but guess what they need to reinvest in? Computers, technology, acquisitions. Those three assumptions allow me to come up with reinvestment and free cash flow. You can see already that in this upbeat, optimistic story that I'm telling for Amazon, cost of capital. Already, you know you're on dicey territory because if you're taking a company from a money-losing small company to a money-making mature company, you should expect your cost of capital to change. And if you look at my cost of capital, it starts at 12.84% for Amazon in year one. Small money-losing company that can't afford to borrow money ends at 9.61% by the time you get and then I subtracted out remember we talked about the option overhang I subtracted out options and I was floored by how much of my value had been given away by Amazon in the previous decade and Amazon wasn't alone because you had accountants telling you it doesn't cost you much just give away millions they took it to heart the option they gave away took away 2.9 billion 35 it's trading at 20 and he asked me what are you doing i should be willing to say i'm buying otherwise what's the point of valuation and half my portfolio is composed of companies i've bought because of that question a value company somebody says what are you doing and i either have a choice telling them i'm not buying and losing their you know attention for the rest of the valuation classes i'm buying so ask me the analogous question you're obviously not asking me whether me to say not in this lifetime it's not confidence remember that to make money what do you have to do you have the market price is correct so when i buy something undervalued you ask me how long am i willing to hold my answer is as long as it takes i'm not a portfolio manager i don't have to be right, but I have to be right within six weeks. This is one of the great asymmetries in investing. When something is undervalued, there is a bargain basement strategy, right? You can buy and hold and wait. When something is overvalued, there isn't an analogous strategy on the other when it'll happen. Yes. Do you ever find it useful to think about when the big dislocation between your value and the market price, what has to be true for the price to convert? You can always, but you can solve for only one variable at a time. That's always been the limits of expectations investing, which Mike Morbush, one of my favorite authors' books is, is basically surveilling the companies. Why don't you solve for a variable? It can be growth. It can be margin. It can be sales to capital. It can be discount rate, but you can't do all four. with young companies. If you're valuing a snowflake, don't go look at the regression beta page. Because here's what you can see. In January 2000, when I looked at the regression beta page for Amazon, 2.23 was the regression raw beta, but there's a standard error, 0.50, which means the true beta for Amazon can be anywhere from 1.2 to 3.2. So what's the solution? What do we use when you don't trust the regression beta? Use a bottom-up beta. And in this case, I used two bottom-up betas. Don't come into the kitchen. You don't want to see me make the food I deliver, even at the very top restaurants. I'm going to take you to the kitchen and it's not going to be an edifying site because I'm going to tell you how the numbers came about. So let's start with the revenue growth rate of 42%. When I first valued Amazon, I did it the way I was taught to do valuation, which is sequentially. What that means, you do your one, then you do your two, then you do your three. a pretty large retail company. You're saying, what does that even mean? I didn't know what it meant. So what I did was I went to download it. And this is the nice thing about a space like retail with most of the big players are publicly traded. Download the companies. I looked at their revenues. I wanted to get a sense of perspective. What does a big retail company look like? The biggest retail company in 2000 was Walmart. I think 180 billion in revenues. I stopped and said, will Amazon end up as big as Walmart? And in 2000, my answer was probably not. adjust terms about 40 billion. There's your secret. 40 billion is my end revenue because that's where I think they'd end up. You say, how do you come up with all of these growth rates? I just made them up. The growth rates are not the end game. The growth rates you have in your DCF valuation, that's not the number. The number you should be focusing on is the end revenues in your 10. Your growth rate is just a means for me to see how big you can make the company, your value shouldn't change that much. You're saying, what about margins? Well, what about them? I have the starting number, I have the ending number. When I first sat with the spreadsheet, all I had were blank cells between years one and 10. And I'm a lazy person. And I said, you know what? Minus 36.7. What's my ending point? Plus 10. What's the distance between the two points? 46. I've moved half the distance to my goal, which brings me to minus 13.35. I'm at minus 13.35. What do I want to be? Plus 10. I moved half. Why saying why half? Why not? I smooth, you can say by year four, I'm going to be at my target margin. If you think it's going to take a lot more work and you say year 10, I'm going to have to, I'll end up at the same margin, but I'll have to dig deeper and lose more money before I get there. But it's a mechanism for capturing that part of the story. So as my margin goes from negative to positive, That's 46.71. Divide by two, that moves me 23.35%. That brings me to minus 13.35. For the first year. Now you're at minus 13.35, you're going to plus 10. The distance is minus 13.35, 10, it's 23.35. I take half the distance, it brings me to minus 1.68. So revenue growth, I just made up. I just, the only rule I followed is higher numbers up front, lower numbers later. I keep track of your losses for the first three years. And this is the most effective way to deal with NOLs. It's rather than keep them separate, incorporate it into your cash flows because the only effect of having an NOL is the taxes will save you when you first start to make money. It's only in year five that I first start to pay taxes, but even in year five, there's an NOL left over. And year six, you get the full tax rate. So when you give me the marginal tax rate for a money losing company, this study that came out of Wharton about 20 years ago, which actually looked at IPOs and IPOs is in the most cases, a company's the peak of their growth. You go public when growth is peaking. And they look at the revenue growth of these companies relative to the sector that these companies belong to. So one year after the IPO, if you look at the revenue growth rate, it's 15% higher than the second. You're saying, that's why I bought these IPOs. Look at the how high the growth rate is. Two years later, rather than the rule. So if you feel the urge to add an extra five years, do so. But remember, if you value a company to be an exceptional company, you have no upside left for yourself as an investor. So I'm going to stick with 10. But it's easy to expand that out to 15 or 20. There's no technical reason why you can't do it. It's a purely investor reason. Now, let's say it's a capital ratio. invested capital with your sales to capital ratio assumption. If I divide the after-tax operating income by the invested capital, I come up with, let's call it an imputed return on capital. You're not using return on capital directly, but whether you like it or not, you're making assumptions about future return on capital with the assumptions you're making about margins, growth, you're saying so what? In the case keep track of your imputed return on capital. So you can use that signal to go back and tweak your sales to capital ratio. It's one more piece of input into what should my sales to capital ratio be in the future is whether you're ending up with a company that you can live with, that you're comfortable. Now, I talked about this at the start of the class, but let me reemphasize. These young companies, 15 billion, it would have been 18 point something billion if I did not have those negative cash flows. I'm effectively knocking down value by 16% because of those negative cash flows. That's a dilution effect already factored into your value. And that's why I don't want to count it in the number of shares as well, because that would be double counting. Now, one of the lessons I didn't take% die in year one. And every year you can see the drop off. By the time you get to year six, in this case year seven, only 30% of companies that started up survived to year seven. There are a couple of things you learn. One is the failure rate decreases the longer a company is around. So if you're value a startup that just started up, the failure risk can be 60%. If it's been around two years, that alone adds to it. a company, I can estimate what failure risk there should be. It's a work in progress. It's a one number in my valuation where I'm working to come up with a better way of estimating failure risk. Because the young companies, it could be a huge factor in what your final value is. Because the higher the failure risk, the less chance there is that you will get to that elephant in the room, the Nirvana number, the terminal value. And I'm saying somebody buying this from you in a fire sale is going to pay only half of that intrinsic value, 25%. If you're really pessimistic, you can put in 0%. So that failure risk can also be used for things like nationalization risk, because in nationalization, the worry often is that the government will pay you half of what you're worth, one quarter. So think of failure Somebody must have owned the stock at that time. And I said, possible is such a weak word. And this is the expectations part. I said, there is a combination of revenue growth and margins that will give you $84. I can back it up. And the nice thing about a breakeven table is you're actually allowing two things to vary. So basically the shaded cells are all of the inputs and where I was off and how that has affected my valuations of Amazon in the year since. But I'll kind of hold off on that because there's a, there's the rest of the story here that I think we can learn from when you look at young companies. So we'll see you on Wednesday. which is companies that might be fairly valued that I bought when they were undervalued, but I've left them in the company like 3M, Coca-Cola. Companies like Facebook come and go. Now, because the more swings there are in the price and the value, the more likely it is that a company will come and go from your portfolio, the more stable value and price become. So I bought companies that used to be young companies that have now become mature companies admission of failure in value. I come in saying I'm willing to hold for a long period, but I'm also willing to sell really quickly if the price goes up too much. I don't like it when that happens because it creates more tax consequences for me. I prefer to be right in the long term than right in the next six weeks. I don't quite understand. it's like a long-term investment philosophy part of it right that's why you value companies it's part of an investment i mean i'm saying value might be part of your toolkit it might not be depending on what investment philosophy you put now if you get a chance you go to my website i have an investment philosophy class it's an it's a free class you can actually watch the sessions about why you know why how do you pick a philosophy what is an investment philosophy",
