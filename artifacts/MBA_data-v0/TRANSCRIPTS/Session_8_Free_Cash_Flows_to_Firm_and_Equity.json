  "text": " I think we're going to need to pop that. Yeah. Hello. to be able to work with the local community to be able to do that. So I think that's just a few things. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My suggestion is you keep your work as much as you can on the quiz, because it's not multiple choice. I look for steps to see if you got through each step. So now, but I've made it one sided. So if you make a mistake, you can scratch it out right in the back of the page. There's plenty of page right. But if you want to bring scrap paper so you can do calculations on the side, you're welcome to. Now, but you can bring a calculator. If you don't have a calculator, create a calculator on your phone. my suggestion is if you've just started preparing don't start with 1997 and work forward that's the wrong strategy start with 2022 and work backwards right because they're more relevant in terms of the material i cover it's going to change in fact the original exams are midterm exams i used to give one in the middle of the class quiz by looking at a couple of things we're going to run into today. One is, you know, some of you are valuing money losing companies. And many analysts value money losing companies. One of the ways they deal with the fact five years, even if that's normal, you're missing the fact that your company might have doubled in size over the last five years. Using dollar look at ways of getting around that. There are other things you can do. Second, we're also going to talk about free cash flows equity towards the end of today's class. And we all know how to compute it, right? It's an after debt cash flow. So you start with net income, you subtract reinvestment, you subtract out net debt cash flows, and you come up with a free cash flow equity. And sometimes that number can be negative. In fact, for that to happen, markets have to stay open and accessible. Is that a safe assumption? I'll give you an example. I'm going to show you an evaluation of Amazon I did in 2000. Peak of the dot-com boom, negative cash flows. Without a batting of an eye, I assumed that they could raise the capital. You know why? Because I was caught up in the mood of the moment, dot-com company raising capital. How easy can it get at the peak of the dot-com boom? One year later, I valued Amazon. it's done. The game is over. Nirvana is not showing up. You're not going to get to terminal value. You could, but if you're the kind of company we're talking about, right? The assets you're going to sell are going to be a fraction of the going concern value. These are not large physical assets, right? You're not selling infrastructure. You're not selling plant equipment. You might have some patents, brand names you could sell, let's talk about going back and let's talk about leases. We talked about converting leases to debt. Somebody give me the intuition. Why do we convert leases to debt? What is it about lease leases that make them debt? Oh, anybody want to try what, what, what makes leases debt? Yeah. It's a contractual commitment, right? the operating income. What does that mean? You take the existing operating income, you add back the lease expense saying I should never have subtracted it out. Then you subtract out the depreciation you'd have had in the leased asset. A messy process, but you're effectively saying if this were debt, I'd have created an asset, the asset would have depreciation, you restate the operating income. In most cases, it will push up the operating income for companies with lots of lease commitments. In some cases, it can push it down, but most cases will push it up. No, you're not subtracting the first payment, right? You're taking the asset that's created, then you're applying some kind of depreciation method to it, right? So if you have a 10-year lease, you in fact have a 10-year asset. So you take the present value of the lease, it's almost like you're writing off one-tenth each year. company? What kind of return on capital do I earn? All of those numbers now get altered because I'm taking what I think is a more realistic measure of what leases should be. Yes? Anybody who follows IFRS a gap has to. It's not a choice anymore nice thing is they still give you the lease commitments as a footnote so you can double check. That's why for the last three years I've been capitalizing leases, even though accountants have done it for me because I just don't trust them. So accounting did come to its senses finally in 2019, 70 years after they realized it was a problem, they're capitalizing leases. Now it's part of debt in year for the next three years. It's a contractual commitment. It is debt. If you had to value Al Nasser, 61%. Europe, I'm starting to lose some traction, 47%. You go to emerging markets and Japan, you completely lost me because what accountants treat as debt is very spotty. So my advice to you is with every company, capitalized leases, in some cases, you're going to capitalize that that was a waste of time. You can just use the accounting debt. In others, lease, there's different words for the same thing. A one-year lease is like a one-year, I mean, effectively. No, if it's a one-year lease, it wouldn't show up in your balance sheet either. There'd be no commitments, right? It's a much more flexible company, but there's a consequence, right? It has less debt, but what's the danger? Every year, you've got to go to worse company, right? It's just a different company. So would you rather have a more indebted company with a more solid business model that you know is renewable or a company with less debt with a business model that every year has to get renewed based on what the lease agreements are? I'm not sure one wins out over the other, right? So it's not as if you're a beer company, right? Better form, more form, less form, I don't know what you do research on. So R&D is not an issue in many businesses. But in the businesses where it is an issue, I think accountants miscategorization really screws up the numbers. They're taking the biggest capex these companies have and treating it as an operating expense. I've always struggled with the accounting reasoning for doing it. expense and treat. But I got to this R&D and say, I really don't get this. My accounting professor told me that if you have an expense that creates benefits over many years, it's a capital expense. And here you have the ultimate capital expense, R&D, and you're expensing it. Tell me why. Think like an accountant for a few minutes, but then snap out of it because it can ruin your way of thinking. If you think like an accountant, what's the accounting rationale being conservative. You know in what sense expensing R&D is conservative, right? You lower your income. They say, we're reporting lower income. We can have a debate on whether we want our income to be estimated conservatively or realistically. I think realistic is better than conservative, but I didn't even want to fight that fight. I said, let's assume that you are being conservative and you're lowering income. What do you show on your balance sheet when you wait for them to do the right thing. So let's do it right. It's not that difficult to do. To capitalize R&D, here's the process I'm going to go through. I'm going to start by asking you a question. It's going to be a tricky question to answer, but a question that I think any business that spends a lot on R&D has to think about. On average, how long does it take between the time you do R&D and a commercial product emerges SAP. I'm going to try to move that up. I'm sorry. You've heard of SAP? It's a German software company. It competes with Cisco. It's a business to business company. Very well run technology company. Now, I told you the amortizable life. I'll give you a very simple indicator years and the most recent year. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to take the R&D expense from five years ago, $745 million. Remember, I've been writing off one-fifth of it each year. I write the last one-fifth off this year and it's gone from my book. So I keep track of what I'm writing off and what's left over. R&D from four years ago, I write off one-fifth, there's one-fifth left over. R&D from three years ago, I write off one-fifth, there's two-fifths left over. So if I put 2.9 billion in the asset side, I've got to add 2.9 billion to the other side. And I have two choices. I can add it to debt or I can add it to equity. Which one should I add it to? It came out of equity earnings. It's going to increase my book equity. Question. Because timing in a discounted cash flow valuation is very weird. So when I start my valuation, I say this is time zero. where did the money come from right it came out of your net income it came out of after debt no income so it is your income as so if i hadn't done that it would come to you as retained earnings right so that's basically why it goes to equity because equity investors are effectively paying for the rd yes why is the emirate because shoe waiting to drop. And here's what that other shoe is. When you do the calculation, your operating income will increase. Why? Because I've added back the R&D, subtract out the amortization, and my R&D exceeds my amortization by 117 million. There's a tax thing that I'll come back and deal with the loose end, but my operating income will go up. So I'll. Exactly offset. So you say, why did we go through this torture if the free cash flow to the firm is not changing? Because it changes the composition of your free cash flow. It gives you a much better sense of what your company is actually earning and what it's reinvesting. My problem with tech company earnings right now is they're incredibly opaque. It should, if you're keeping track of the remaining book value. Yes. How does capitalizing on the reinvestment ratio? Because remember the reinvestment ratio looks at what you put back into the firm divided by after tax operating income. And the original SAP calculation, the reinvestment is 2 million on top of whatever the original operating income was. I think it was 1,285. Looks like they like Apple that's already profitable, and then you clean up for the R&D. Your margin goes from 48% to 55%. They're much more profitable than they truly are, but accountants watch the Super Bowl ads. Some of those ads are getting you to try to buy stuff right now, but a big reason you run Super Bowl ads is not to get current consumption, but to build up a brand name, right? And if your biggest asset is brand name, then at least a portion of the advertising, maybe not all of it, should be treated as a capital expense. I did this for Coca-Cola using a 30-year life because you want to keep people working for you long-term. It changes the way we think about it. Now, I think we routinely miscategorize items outside of the traditional manufacturing companies. And in valuation, you're not bound by accountants coming to their senses. You have to do it yourself. One final example, if you're a company like Uber or Netflix, how do you measure success? What does Netflix get out when they do an earnings report? it has a loss of a half a billion, but its loss is coming from a one-time charge. And it's truly one time. And I'll explain what I mean by truly one time of a billion dollars. Your job just got very easy, right? To value this company. If it's a truly one-time charge, remember all you care about is earnings in the future. What are you going to use as earnings next year? You have a loss of a half a billion. You have a one-time. Just use a half a billion as profit. Act like you're not. This is the easiest scenario. income line. You can report earnings before extraordinary charges, after extraordinary. And companies have become really good at playing this game of moving operating expenses into extraordinary or one-time charges. And it's your job and my job to make sure that they don't get away with it. So my advice to you is look at the, you know, if you can download the history for your company, assuming it has a history, look at their history of extraordinary charges. If you see an extraordinary expense showing up once My nightmare scenario, valuing companies, is valuing a company, but if you see a dozen red flags and they keep recurring over time, there's something going on. I'll give you a few examples of red flags. First is a company that reports income from unspecified sources, shell companies. You know, Enron did this year after year. Nobody had any billions of dollars coming in. Again, by itself, it might be okay. But if you see it in conjunction with other things, time to worry. file. But for some companies, you'll see the 10K for 2021. And then you'll see five other 10K filings for 2021. Because each time you restate your 10K, you have to go back to the SEC. So if you see a company consistently restating things, again, by itself, it might be just an honest mistake, but you see it recurring, there's something going on. One of my favorite measures is actually, if you look at the net, the income statement, you get a measure of accrual income. actually give you indicators. One is by a guy called Terry Smith, a UK-based accountant, great writer. So you can see some of the things he looks for. But I would look at companies, I mean, there's short sellers like Hindenburg and Citroen, because that's their skill set. That's what they do well. They're not good at valuation, but they're pretty good at forensic accounting. Which brings me to the money losing company. At least one out of every five of you doing money losing companies, this is your page where you decide the template you're going to use. If you have a one-time or extraordinary charge, that's your easy scenario. Just take it out, recompute the income, you're home free. Probably maybe one out of every 100 companies that you can get away with this. Your company might have been affected by some macro effect. 2022 was not an issue, but 2020 oil prices dropped. Every oil company lost money. Something in its business model that's not working. It's fixable, but not fixable overnight. Maybe you're a manufacturing company or you've abandoned or not taken care of your manufacturing facilities for a long time. They're inefficient. You got to make them efficient. You can't make them efficient overnight. In those two cases, you can't replace losses with profits next year. You've got to map out a pathway from negative income to positive income. I'll show you some of the ways to map it out, but that's the target margin. so some businesses you might conclude there is no pathway to value in which case the equity is worth nothing probably could get a liquidation value if you liquidate it but that's entirely okay that's part of valuation as well as deciding not to push the envelope don't normalize every company don't make every company go back to help because that might not and in fact i i think you struck you hit the nail on the head when you said But here we're applying the tax rate to all of your operating income, not to the margin. So the debate becomes a little different. So I'm going to give you some choices on what tax rate to use. And I want you to think through the consequences of what will happen if you use that tax rate of the country you're in that comes from the tax code the u.s it's 25 in germany it's 29 so based on the part of the world you're in the fourth is you can use some kind of weighted average marginal tax rate of all of the countries you operate in the fifth is maybe it's none of the above but if that's none of the above you better give me what you're going to increase your earnings, increase your cash flows. That might be okay if the reason your effective tax rate is lower is permanent. What do I mean by that? Apple's effective tax rate is lower than the marginal tax rate because they generate income in other parts of the world where tax rates are lower than the U.S. This isn't going to go away. help you do this. You have depreciation methods. You can use some kind of credits you take. And the tax court is full of things you can use to defer taxes. The key word is defer taxes. If I use that lower tax rate now as my tax rate forever, you know what I'm effectively assuming about tax defer? That you can defer taxes forever. And there's a padded cell in a federal penitentiary waiting for you. rate all the way through. You can, but you're going to undervalue your company, right? Because for an Apple, you're definitely then overpaying taxes and understating cash flows by assuming they'll jump to 25% right now. So use the flexibility of being able to adjust tax rates over time. And you can take advantage of the fact that your company has reasons for paying lower taxes now, but those reasons might disappear. Yes of trying to bring it into my cash flows. So here's the simple rule. If you're looking at free cash flow of the firm and you look at the tax rate, you can start with the effective tax rate and move towards the marginal. If you're a multinational, I still use the country of incorporation for my tax rate, partly because so many of my companies are either US or annual report, somewhere they should tell you how much they're carrying forward in net operating losses. You think, why would it matter? you're going to pay your marginal tax rate. That's what I've built into the spreadsheet is I keep track of the NOL. So I ask you, what's your NOL? Then I keep track of your losses. The first few years that you make money, you notice you don't pay much in taxes or no taxes at all. It's my way of bringing the effects of the NOL into your free cash flow to the firm, as opposed to what a lot of bankers keep the NOL separate, treat it like an asset. Then they It's because you want to grow in the future. Your assumptions about net capex have to be tied to your assumptions about growth. Notice I used your assumptions on both because you assume both. And you have to be internally consistent. So if you tell me I have high growth and high net capex, I'm not going to fight you on it. It's what you think about the company. You say you have low growth and low net capex. I'm going to say that's perfectly OK. more growth, am I also thinking about CapEx? Because you cannot de-link those items. In fact, one thing to do actually is to link directly what you're assuming into reinvest into your growth rate. So you're forced to think about what will it take for me to get this higher growth rate? My simplistic device for that is that sales to capital ratio, where I say, okay, you want more growth? This is how much reinvestment you'll need. And you can override me and say, you know what? I don't need it for the first five years. I have excess capacity. But there's another way you can grow that we haven't even talked about. If you're in a hurry to grow and you don't want to take projects, you don't want to acquire customers one at a time, you go out and do an acquisition of another company. I've never understood why acquisitions are not treated as gigantic capital expenditures, because that's what they are. I'm not saying they're good orbased, they're not cash-based. So I'll give you an example from a company that was riding high in 1999, a company called Cisco. Cisco's market cap increased from $4 billion in 1990 to $400 billion at the peak of the dot-com boom, a hundredfold over a decade. And what made Cisco unique among technology companies was it grew almost entirely through I was able to get the numbers right out of the statement of cash flows. The other three I found in the footnotes, but not in terms of actual money paid, but in terms of number of shares they used to do the acquisition. I had to go look up the average share price around that day. It was a pain in the neck. But if you look at the three biggest acquisitions, they were all stock-based acquisitions. My total acquisitions in that year was $2.516 billion. net capex at Cisco was not 98 million, it was 3.7 billion. So what's the bad news and the good news? When I have this much reinvestment, what's the bad news? My free cash flows of the firm are much more negative, right? What's the good news? When I project out growth, I can be much more expansive about my growth assumptions. So that's why there's no good news or bad news about capitalizing something. I'm not saying this company is going to get more or less valuable. It's actually book value of equity. It's the only place. You have one accounting number divided by another accounting number. This is the stuff of nightmares, right? Because everything accountants do to one of those two numbers or not due to one of those two numbers is going to screw up your ROIC. You don't capitalize R&D, you screw up your, you take a big restructuring charge, you screwed up your ROIC. So I think it's a metric, but it's a very flawed metric. For mature companies that have settled in, you can get away with it. worry about with ROIs. Yes. There's no certainty around any cash. So let's take the word certainty out. Everything is uncertain. It's a continuum metaverse. So you could give them all the pain of the reinvestment, but none of the ammunition to predict out any gain from it. So guess what happened to Facebook stock price? People assumed you'd reinvest 100 billion. And they said, you have no idea what you're doing. Otherwise, you'd have told us. So we're going to assume you're going to do nothing. So you're right. It's a job we constantly face. We're trying to make our best judgments. We make the best judgments. We have to think through what does that investment mean? constant amortization until 2001, you wrote it off over 40 years, equal amounts. Now it's done, this, it's keep accountants employed because basically every year they've got to come back, they've got to reassess your goodwill. And if it's gone down in value, not if it's gone up in value, they've gone down in value, they can impair the goodwill. So it happens. And it's take them out of current liabilities and make them dead in my cost of capital. So they're out. So I can't count them because I've counted them as part of capital. So what am I left with? Supplier credit, accrued liabilities, deferred taxes, deferred this. Let's go to the current asset side. Help me out here. What am I going to see there? Here you'll see cash. What else? me rephrase it. What has to be true for cash to be a wasting asset? I'm sorry, what did you say? If it doesn't generate interest, it's almost there. But if you were in Europe three years ago, there was no inflation. So if it doesn't earn a fair rate of return, you're saying what's a fair rate of return? Well, companies invested their cash in banks and checking accounts, sometimes with no interest, because they said, what else can we do? That is a wasting ass when you earn below market rates or leave your cash someplace where you're not earning interest. If you have a CFO, it's a $100 billion cash balance. It's left it in a checking account. I check his house for toasters. Maybe he's getting a lot of toasters, and that's why he's chosen the most wasteful arguments in valuation, which is people say, is it operating cash or non-operating cash? I don't care. The question we have is, is it wasting cash or non-wasting cash? If you're Walmart, you need $4 billion in cash and operations, but you keep that $4 billion invested in T-bills and commercial paper. I don't care that you need it for operations. Second, it's an incredibly volatile item. Changes in working capital are notorious for jumping from positive to negative, which means if you take last year's change in working capital and you make it your basis for forecasting cash flows, you might be doing some very strange things. What can you do to fix it? Average things over time. I actually take working capital as a percent of revenues because it's a much more stable, predictable number and an easier number to forecast on. which brings me to free cash flow equity. When you think about free cash flow as equity and you think about the difference from cash flow to firm, the key is these are cash flows left over for equity investors. Now, I've often had long arguments about how do you measure potential dividend? Because that's what we're trying to measure. I've seen analysts say, well, earnings are potential dividends. And you can see their reasoning, right? If a company wanted to, they could pay all their earnings out as dividends. are not potential dividends. What are potential dividends? Potential dividends are cash flows left over after you've met every conceivable need. The way I describe free cash flow at equity is think like the owner of a business. You're sitting in front of a cash till. And every time you have a payment, do you pay it out? Every time your cash goes, I mean, they go into the till. It's the cash left in the till at the end of the year after you've met every conceivable need. Working capital, be in the operating cash flow section. The net capex will be in the investing section. And then I'm going to look at the financing section to see if I borrowed money, which is a cash inflow, or repaid money, which is a cash outflow. So I start with net income. I subtract out reinvestment. I take that effect of debt. I come up with a free cash flow equity. That is my potential dividend. I can pay stay fixed. Your debt ratio will go down. A healthy growing company should generally have a net debt inflow every year. Because if you don't, you're going to become an all equity funded company over time. And that might be your plan. But if you're growing, you keep your debt ratio fixed, which is what you've done in your cost of capital. You're in effect assuming that there'll be debt borrowed every year to keep up with the growth of the company, to keep that debt ratio stable. So it seems like a free lunch. As I said, everything's there, except for acquisitions you pay for with stock. And that's why they're tricky, because you go to the footnotes, you got to look at what they did. But the free cash flow equity is your potential dividend. There's actually a neat little trick in the statement of cash flows that you can use to check your free cash flow equity. Now, what's the end game in the statement of cash flows? What do accountants use it to explain? The change in your net income look like? Probably a net loss. All your future is in growth. paying dividends, right? Because as you mature, you're going to see a free cash flows to equity kind of become more positive and get more positive. And then you go into decline, the company starts to shrink again. I think this is all very abstract. I tried this on Tesla. It's actually a pretty interesting story because, you know, actually zero. That's why it's not there. 2021, you've got net income of 5.5 billion, free cash flow equity of 2.3 billion. As Tesla matures, here's what you can expect to see. Net income growth is going to start to level off. Free cash flows equity are going to climb towards net income, right? Because your reinvestment is going to drop off. There's nothing special about young growth companies. You just have to figure out where they are in the life cycle and graph them out over time. So if you get a chance,, I compute these numbers for every company. So what I did at the start of 2023, I went and looked at the net income in the aggregate for companies, every publicly traded company by part of the world. So there's a net income. I computed the free cash flow equity in Many parts of the world, the cash return, if you think of dividends plus buybacks, is well in excess of free cash flow equity. US, for instance, in 2022, at $231 billion in free cash flow equity, they returned $1.5 trillion in dividends and buybacks. Remember I said you could use net income versus free cash flow equity. And talk about growth rates. Whatever their stock quote is like, the history of never paying dividends, which are even years. From the company standpoint, they're actually the same, right? I did get an email. If I can buy my brand, if Coca-Cola sold the name and kept its syrup, its value dissipates in a second. And I'm convinced. Because the person buying the brand name would get the pricing power, not the person voting the syrup. That basically means that brand name has less to do, at least in these consumer product companies, the brand name is the biggest revenue,, does it have value? Absolutely. Does it have permanent value? Not necessarily. But it has a greater stake by the most of the competitors. I think that it will vary across even within businesses. There are things you need to look at Nike versus some startup shoe company might be very different. Yeah. You know, besides the market niche. And it also depends on how much of your products real benefits come from not what the product is offering, but the psychological to cash flows from going on an effective, eventually margin. Correct. Is that applicable to the cost of tax benefits? No, cost of debt always is at the margin of tax rate. Even though Apple is 12% taxed, you get the tax benefit because you choose where to borrow, and you make sure you borrow in those spots on the world, and you get the 25% tax benefit. The tax rate as a tax rate wouldn't make sense. get two or three years of financials and then you your valuation will be more dependent on looking at industrial averages or public companies you want to get a sense of is my margin mutual and of course but the country of course which is morocco is a unique market so if i think about what what you're what are your competitive advantages to mid-year valuation, you know all you have to do is get the value, multiply by one, because the capital raised to power 0.5. You've effectively done what those guys did with all their mid-year, because that's all the effect, right? The half-year discount rate effect. The problem with mid-'t think it's worth it. you you you Here they are. They're those things right there. Yeah, but they have to come down. Right, so how do you get them down? That's why I was calling IT. Me, it has to do something that has to do with the system. Oh, okay. So we just can't pull them down. Right. So, Willie's going to come. Let me just confirm that the guidance is in place. And see what people need to know about it. It's on first and mean, I don't want to bother her. She's at home, isn't she? Yeah. She's working.
