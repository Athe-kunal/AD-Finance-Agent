  "text": " Obrigado. Thank you. are valued now. Anybody value First Republic? Anybody value Silicon Valley? That's kind of dead in the water. Now you might have to change companies. And who knows, First Republic, by the end of this week, you might have to do your own set of gymnastics. But we're going to come back and talk about value-backed, because I think that, I tell people, there's no sector I hate valuing more than banks. And you can see what happens if the trust gets shaken. And I think this time around, you have less trust to begin with, because 2008 was the original shakeup. And I don't think the trust has ever fully come back. So you can already see people's conspiracy theories that this has all been designed by the big banks last few cents in intrinsic valuation. Because partly because I want you to be able to clean up your own intrinsic valuations. So let's start with our usual, start with the classics. Today, one of the things we're going to talk about is the difficulty of valuing. Some companies are more difficult to value than others. Why? Because they're complex, they're in multiple businesses, they're in multiple countries. So let's say you're comparing two companies. So first company is in a single business, has a very simple holding structure and is transparent to content. How many of you would value the complex company because you don't understand it very well? When I phrase it that way, it sounds weird, but nobody? If you open up any textbook and you start entering numbers, what are you going to find? Same cost of capital, same growth rate, same cash flow, you plug them in. Traditional valuation, we actually value simple and complex companies equally, and I think it's dangerous. to do about complexity. I'll tell you when my wake-up moment on this issue came about. It wasn't right away. It took me a while to get there. But talk about the effect of complexity. Can you assume that the marginal investor understands it better than the one on the airport could diversify the online real estate? You're assuming that's already priced in, is that what you're in better shape because nobody really knows what's going on. So I think the most dangerous scenario is when insiders, it's not even margin investors, when the insiders know it and they basically price it in and push the price down, but you don't know it and you're still keeping the value elevated. So we'll come back and talk about the complexity issue. in which case you're subtracting the face value of the debt from the estimated intrinsic value to the company or is it 20 million which is the so the real question i'm asking you should i subtract our book value of that face value debt should i subtract that market value i'm willing to listen to both sides how many of you think i should be subtracting out the face value of the debt The reason the market value is lower than the book value is simply because interest rates have moved. I'm still allowing for the fact. I'm not saying I'm not paying, but I'm paying over time. I'm paying 100 million right now. It's spread out over time. That's a good news. But what's the second scenario where market value is going to be lower than book value? It's got nothing to do with interest rates. If you're in bad shape, you're going to be a distressed company, right? And then it gets more dangerous. You see what? you got to ask why is it different purely interest rate moment there's no distress issue stick with the market back because remember those higher interest rates are being incorporated into your dci how are the higher cost so you're incorporating the effect you have to be consistent so what you subtract out to get to value equity can sometimes be a little dicey especially with distress comments which brings me to my third and final thing And you're going to see in a minute what I mean by this. Let's assume your shareholder is an accountant. 100 million shares outstanding, trading at $10 per share. I decide to give 10 million options to my CEO. Why? Because I really like the guy. But to cushion the impact, I say, look, I'm going to set the strike price on these options equal to the current stock price. Just because an option is that the money doesn't mean it trades for nothing, there's a time premium on the option. When you give away options, you're giving away value. Whose value? They're giving away equity value. They're giving away stake of your equity. And you can't cop out and use the third choice. I'll wait till I see what happens because you've already paid the price. So you've got to incorporate that into your value today. So today we're going to talk about stock-based compensation. We talked about what to do with cash. And what did we say we should do with cash? We said we need cash in the company. Most of the time I said do nothing, but there will be times when you discount cash in the hands of a company. And why is that? What's the reason for discounting cash in the hands of a company? What kinds of companies do you discount cash? Poorly managed companies. You don't trust the management with your cash. In some cases, you might attach a premium to the cash. Why? If it's a small's not an asset. But then you start to see assets that really have value. So let's suppose you're looking at a hotel company. Let's make it the world office store. You value the world office store. So what of the story is 1.25 billion? Why not? You can't have your cake and eat it too, right? You can't sell the real estate and say, guys, can I run a hotel on this real estate that doesn't work that way? The Plaza Hotel became essentially Plaza Apartments because stuck with the hotel cash flows. So if you don't control the company, you don't get to pay the higher of two numbers. But if you could acquire the world of Astoria, would your answer be different? Let's say you could buy the whole company, you can't count both. But what's the essence of this kind of cash flow valuation? Who cares what's in the balance? It's cash flows. What's that land used for? Build a building. What's the building used for? To get you those revenues. Once you do that, you can't count the land, you put the money in, it gets invested in whatever, and you get whatever comes out of it. You can't have overfunding or underfunding with a defined contribution plan. But if you have a defined benefit plan because you promised a fixed pension, whatever money you collect and you invest, funded pension portion to the value equity. I didn't like it then because three years later, you know what happened to that overfunded portion, right? The market collapsed and there was the overfunded. In general, I would not add it. It's not a good practice, but it's nice to have an overfunded pension plan because it allows you to set aside less in contributions, at least for the near term, to cover the difference. So what did. And of course, he seeded the fund. And it's been run for the last 20 plus years. You can see the returns that you made over time. It's a rolling portfolio management, right? Because each class graduates, a new group comes in and runs it. And the Michael Price Fund is built on making pitches, basically. I don't know what the change is. So if you want to buy a stock, you've got to pitch it to everybody else in the group. I said, I don't see a conundrum yet. He said, I've come up with a value of 240 million. It's trading at 300 million as a market cap. I said, I still don't see a conundrum. It looks overvalued. Let it go. He said, here's my conundrum. Seventh time in the three minutes we had the conversation, the word comes out. He says, they have one big asset that they have that I haven't counted in the 240 million. What do you think he was talking about? He said, technically, yes, but you've got a problem. You've got an 80-year-old in a bathrobe hanging out there. You can't exactly throw him out onto the street. And I was talking about the fact that Hugh Hefner was still in the match. He says, what should I do? I said, why don't you check the actuarial tables? So what am I checking for? How long 80-year-olds surround themselves in 26-year-old playmates? It's 11. A lot of pressure on your heart. You could kick the bucket any day. Let's say five years. This is what you come up with. he died and then this guy you see why would i pay that well i guess he wanted the glamour of the mansion you know reflected glory whatever it is maybe he planned to wear a bathrobe and hang out in the mansion you sold for 200 million this is a truly baby bastard so when you think about what can i add on five years to add on things like brand name value this is my worry with accounting and drains your equity value. You've got to come up with more. I'll give you two ways of dealing with underfunding in your discounted cash flow valuation. You can do one or the other, but you can't do both. There'll be double counting. And you can start thinking already about the two ways that you can show it up. One is that you can show up as higher contributions you need to make to lower your cash flows in future years. The other is you can show it as debt outstanding to debt and subtracted debt. But I'm going to give you two rules on debt. One, when you do cost to cap. And there, I don't think you should include accounting statement that claims to be in English, could you read it, but you have no idea what language it is, read it again. It's a language that only accountants or lawyers understand, which is inside accounting law. The objective is to confuse you, not to inform you. So one company simple and I think we kind of decided that simple company should be what, but I also made the confession that in traditional valuation we make the assumption that what you don't know gets G lost 15% of its value. You think what's one company got to do with the other? How do I describe Tyco? A conglomerate that go through acquisition. You see how, why GE was affected, right? Investors said, we got burned by Tyco. How do we know GE is not doing it? And I was teaching this class in the middle of evaluation class, and we brought this up and I raised this issue. Should we be punishing companies I think I was teaching 260. And I said, here's how I'm going to measure complexity. I'm going to count the number of pages in the 10Q and the 10K. I know it's incredibly simplistic, but if there's a company you want to avoid valuing, here, which is the company you least want to touch? I know which one I don't want to touch. This is 1,026 pages in a 10K. This isn't war and peace. to measure the bug out factor. I'll give you examples of things about a company that claims to be geographically diversified but doesn't tell you when. Or they tell you where but you don't recognize any of the regions of the world. It's like a Lord of the Rings universe. I've never seen that. What is that? As you remember value BMW. They're claiming that seven of their revenues came from Oceania. I'm thinking my geography class. countries. We use the example, remember EMEA, we talked about this. So I took all these things and came up with the score and I said the higher the score, the more complex it is. But do you like this more? I said yes, this is so much better. This is why we pay 150,000 dollars for an MBA. I said it does come with a small cost or a big cost. To come up with the going and I thought big companies would be complex. In fact, there were small companies that were incredibly complex and big companies were incredibly simple. Second, emerging market companies were about 20-30% more complex than developed market companies usually because of cross-ordinary structures, not of family group companies. Third, any company that grew through acquisition was almost automatically 30-40% more complex. And some of you might be finding with the luxury sports, the most complex company in the class that semester was GE, Hyundai Heavy, the courier company, but it was GE. I've told people, look, if I become the debtor and my job is to deal with all the investment bankers who get sent out to hell, here's what I would do. I'd make them value GE, if it does not affect the cash flows and it doesn't affect the risk, it can't affect value. So I'll give you the choices. One is, you know, you can do what some analysts did in the late 90s, ignore complexity. In the good times, this tends to happen. People ignore it because they assume what you don't know can't hurt you. Then you go to the other extreme. In a crisis, you completely act like all these things are worth the S&P 500 and split it down the middle. 250 complex companies, some judgment calls at 250 simple, 250 complex companies. For how I computed an implied cost of equity for the S&P 500, I took the index level cash flows. I did that for each half. The implied cost of equity for complex companies was about 1 this class was a star company of those days, Android. So whatever you do, if you decide that your company is deserving of that punishment, there's a place to show. But it might also show up in that final judgment you make. You find a company to be undervalued, you get ready to buy it. It's a complex company with a lot of data and all. Remember the danger of doing that is, especially if you have doubts, it becomes a way you can hide behind those doubts. Value Consulting Incorporated. Citicorp is your first client. They walk in and say, our price-to-book ratio is only 0.9. How do we double it? Easy, right? Knock 300 pages off your 10K. Sounds facetious, but remember, Citigroup had 1,000 pages in its 10K by design. It started the day Citicorp, a bank, bought Travelers Group, an insurance company, because there's too much you don't know. Let's talk about that. There are two places in valuation you're going to run into the debt risk. The first is when you need a cost of capital, right? You need a debt to do cost of capital. The second place is you need a debt to subtract out once you get the firm value to get the value back. And I'm going to give you two I have underfunded pension obligations. I'm worried because I'm at the target of a lawsuit that I can reach. When you get to subtract out the debt, then the rules change. The first is when you talk about book value or market value, the rule that I stated earlier kicks in. If the market value of debt is lower than the book value, simply because of interest rate movement, stay with the market value. There's really no upside to going with book value. companies no longer offer defined benefit plans. This is the legacy of the 20th century. And many of those companies, especially automobile companies, have looked at the government for a bailout. But if you don't get that, it has to come out of equity, you subtract it out. But there's a trickier component, which is if your company is targeting a loss, let me rephrase that, if you're a US company, when your company is targeting a loss, it's not a question of if, then I could end up losing 10 billion, 15 billion, 20 billion. So what should you do with those? Find a good trial lawyer. This has nothing to do with economics because now you're talking about what is the chance I will lose a lawsuit? What will the appeals process look like? What will the end payment look like in Brigham and Sir? What happened in the middle of the 30 years was Congress actually offered the truck companies a deal where they paid tens ofanto they bought themselves a roundup lawsuit which in a sense could potentially bankrupt anyone. I think they've eventually figured out some kind of you know payout tens of millions of dollars but until that payout comes you have to set the likelihood where almost everybody ended up on Wall Street. It was a traders' school, right? You ended up at Goldman's. And those days have shifted. So I think about two years ago, the largest employer here was Amazon. Increasingly, tech companies are competing with banks at the top of their schools. And many of these tech companies are younger tech companies. Lots of problems. The Ubers are the worst. The snowflakes. There's a long lead in them. I thought it was a long lead. What do we do with the rest of compensation expenses? We treat them as cost of console. Come up with operating. So if you use stock-based compensation, what should you do? The logic is impeccable. You need to be treating them like expenses. Finally, accountants are doing this because the longest time they didn't. But they are expenses. And because they're expenses, they're lower income. The fact that they're not cash is neither here nor there. They're in-kind expenses. compensation. Starting in about 2007 and 2008, increasingly stock-based compensation is taking the form of restricted stock. You think what is restricted stock? There are shares in a company that come with a restriction. The restriction is you cannot trade those shares or sell those shares for X number of years. First, you have to vest. In most companies, you have to stay with the company for a period add options or add the money, you say what's the big deal? Right now it's not a big deal right? But they some of them will get exercised and what are the conditions under which options get exercised? Your share price goes up or share price do? They buy back shares and they hold the shares. But either way, it hurts you, right? That buyback comes out of your cash flow. So there's no escape at you, right? Equity investors, one way or the other, you're going to pay for these options. So I'm going to start with a very simplistic example of options. Give me the three ways in which analysts deal with options, ranging from what I call the bludgeon approach, million at the money options to my CEO. And this was a question I asked you, what will happen to the value per share? And of course, the accountants until 2007 would have said, don't worry, these options are worth nothing because they're at the money. The value per share should be unaffected. You can already see the logic doesn't work out, but that was the sales pitch. The second is options do affect your value, but the question is by how much. The reason you're overstating the effect of the value of your equity is you're ignoring the cash that's going to come in when these options get existed. So it's an easy way to fix that. When these options get existed, the 10 million options, you're going to get $100 million in cash coming in, right? So the second approach here is all right. Here's what I do. value of your equity because you're ignoring the time premium there must be a goldilocks solution which is we can bring the time premium of the options in i should be able to get a much better sense of the value what does that mean how do we bring in the time premium option well up to 1971 that's what you had. And we may have option pricing models. And option pricing models are actually, among all valuation models, the ones that are most precise because most of the inputs are given. The S, the K, the R, right? It's somebody on the other side. So the winners and losers, but the company is a side there. But when you have employee options, they get exercised, the share count actually changes. The very act of exercising options can affect the stock price. Imagine the CEO with 10 million options exercising the option, the stock price goes to 18. The minute that exercise happens, there's going to be a. Can you sell your options? Employee options are not trading. People have tried to set up trading platforms, but the companies come down on it very strongly. They're not trading. dollars and strike price of 10 or the example that I just gave the option looks like it's at the month but if I adjust for the fact that exercising this often create dilution the stock price gets adjusted down to 958. essentially I'm adjusting for the expected dilution of the option which will lower the value to call option if I'm worried about only exercise I can take the maturity and maybe even use a five year maturity in fact thing. Just the magnitude of the number of options together was translated into billions of dollars, not hundreds of millions, billions of dollars. But basically, that's what we're trying to do. So now I'm ready to do the right thing. So I'm going to go back to my original example. Remember, I valued the first equated value. Let's talk a little bit about what accountants used to do and what they do now and how that might explain the shift to restricted stock. I told you options took off in 1992. Tens of millions of tech company booked, dot com booked. Everybody gave options as if they were free currency. And accountants aided and abetted them by saying, if you grab at the money options, it's a zero expense. That's when you saw the shift restricted stock. But to show you that you can lead a horse to the water, that way you can pray. What do analysts do? The thousands are not doing the right thing, right? They're trading stock based compensation as an expense, reducing the earnings. And what do analysts do? They revise the whole damn thing. We sometimes wonder, would they do the same thing with leases? I mean, stability must be just built in so deep into their thought processes. headed back to the non-cash expense. It's an in-kind expense. It'll lower your future earnings and cash flows. And the reason I would separate the two is there are some companies that used to give stock-based compensation a lot and have stopped for the most part. Some companies that used to give stock-based compensation in the past will continue to do so in the future. And some companies which have never granted stock-based compensation in the past but might do so in the future. So you have to deal with two separate problems. we're going to go to our preferred spot. So we're a number cruncher, you're going to go with the number cruncher, you're going to build Excel spreadsheets, you're going to make them more and more complex. We're a storyteller, we're going to tell bigger and bigger stories. And left to our own devices, we're going to operate in our own delusions. So this is a pushback on working on your needs. So what I'd like to do is take you through the process of going from story numbers. And this is a process I go through on almost every one of my evaluations. And the reason I'm going to use to illustrate this process is a company that I valued 10 years ago, where I learned a great deal more about storytelling and connecting to numbers than any other company I've had. It's a valuation I did of Uber in June of 2013. Let me lay the groundwork. the no rule out on the you should take it away so so but i look at them and say what does it do so my task is laid out for me right i can't vary the company i don't know what it yeah so guess who i call first my son but he's sleeping it's only 11 30 in the morning but he kept what i call college student hours magical things start to happen the gps opens up and i see a car trying to drive towards me why new york city you don't get from the point a to point b in this truck with zigging and zagging all these one-way streets closed streets and i can see the name in the car it says george i've never seen this with the yellow car fascinated i want george and his car to navigate their way in front of 44 west fourth street i don't know there's a hi george He said in New York City, it's illegal to stop on the streets and offer somebody a ride. And that's actually true. There's all these rules against gypsy cabs. He said Uber connects me with customers. So that's interesting. And I could understand why this guy drove Uber. So 30 minutes later, he dropped me off and I offered to pay. He says, you don't have to pay me. I said, it's free. He said, it's not free. When you download it, they, you own a car and call it. Why do you need to use a right? I acted like I knew what Roomba was right from the beginning. Why do you want to use a right chair in the service? He says, dad, on Friday nights and Saturday nights, I really like Uber. Now, there are some follow up questions you don't ask as a parent. I kind of got it. I said, I mean, this is a kid who would never call a yellow cab. Which led me to one final question. What's so special about Uber? Why couldn't I go down into my basement? It's an intermediate. Get a big computer, connect cars to customers. And I can think of two things that Uber had that I didn't. One was $3 billion, which is what they raised from the VC. They had it. I did not. A little bit of a disadvantage there. Ubo is a privately owned company with almost nothing publicly available. The only thing I knew about Ubo was how much they had as gross bills leaning in and how much money they lost. And those were leaked by in a VC presentation somewhere. What I'm trying to say is even if I had access to all of the financials at Ubo, what would I have learned? Small revenues, big losses. Why do you like Uber? Is it possible? Why do you drive for Uber? Because I get much more information from those drivers than I would ever get from the top executives. So I drew a picture basically of how Uber made money. They're an intermediary. What made them special? The networking benefits. And essentially it became the platform that I used to value the company. So that's the first step is understand the business you're in because I'm going to tell a story for the company for every business story. What do you have to convince me as an investor? That you found a pathway, you're looking at a pathway to making money. Is that asking for too much? You'd be surprised at how many startup stories I listen to, but some are usually a geek. It's a great app, it's an amazing app, you've got so many downloads. Finally put up and say, how do you plan to make money? Looks at you like you have two heads. Let me go back and tell you how interesting the app is. At least tell me you thought about the possibility of making money. it as an urban car service company. Already you can see in my story, where do I see it succeeding? In cities and towns as a car service business, which would expand the business by bringing in new users, like my sons. So it is going to expand the business that you see out there, but bringing users would not have been part of the car service business private, who work on it. Remember, car service has been around as a business for 100 years, companies in different parts of the world dominating each region. I did assume that we could keep doing what it's doing. That 20% is completely arbitrary, right? That they keep. I'm sure that, you know, Travis Galatnik was eating dinner in 2008 and somebody said, what percentage of these fares do you plan to keep? He's writing the tip out. You know what? 20% sounds good. There's no good reason for it, but once it sticks, I'm going to assume that it's going to stay sticking. this before. Is it plausible? You need to show me something more, then it can be done. Let me show you it's worked in certain parts of the world and you're going to be able to and probable requires even more specificity. I struggle with explaining the difference because it sounds like I'm playing around. So I've wrestled with lots of different ways of What does that mean? So it was about six months before the World Cup. I said, is it possible that Brazil will win the World Cup? You asked 300 Brazilians six months before a World Cup, is it possible that Brazil will win the World Cup? What do you think the answer was? Of course it is. We won it five times before. I said, okay. Is it plausible that Brazil will win the World Cup? If I had asked this question in December of 2014, that room would have been a little shaky. And if this happens, if this happens, then right. You can see with each one, I'm raising the ante. And I think about it the same way. When I hear a startup story, I have to first make sure it's possible. Then I'm going to ask the right questions, make sure it's possible. And you can see that this is what separates fairytales from business stories. So I'm going to leave you with some thoughts. You can have impossible stories. You'd be amazed at how many business stories I hear, right? This is the story. I'm not even asking you any questions. where banks have to say a deal makes sense. And that valuation, I have a core estimated a 6% growth rate in Tesla in perpetuity to justify the valuation. My first reaction is, what currency you value in Tesla? Argentine pesos? Turned out to be US dollars, 6% growth rate. That's an impossible valuation. Or a valuation that claims that growth can come from being more efficient every year in perpetuity. You can cut costs and cut costs, but your margin can't exceed 100%.",
