  "text": " Hi, welcome to Valuation. I know many of you come in with preconceptions about what this class is about. And rather than feed into those preconceptions, I'd like to talk about what this class is not about. And in the process, perhaps, perhaps, you will get a sense of what this class is about. I know for many of you, valuation is a set of equations and formula and models, and perhaps that is what you're expecting to get, a script. Rather than cook from a recipe, you'll be able to cook on your own. Second, I know for many of you, you're expecting a class built around valuing publicly traded companies. You want to value the Coca-Colas, the Airbnbs, the Ubers, the Facebooks of the world. And that's okay. That's pretty much what many people think about valuation. But I hope to make this class much I hope you can value just about any kind of business, small or large, in whatever sector, in whatever market. Third, I want to draw a contrast between two words we use interchangeably in investing, value and price. Let me set this on the table. If I believe that markets are efficient, what I'm effectively saying, the value and the price are pretty much the same thing. And if you believe that, there's really no point taking this can only be pressed. Fourth, I'm going to surprise you. I know many of you are going to come into this class expecting to see Excel spreadsheets and I'll make a confession I've never opened an Excel spreadsheet in the context of a class. To me the essence of evaluation is not the collection of numbers that make it but the story behind the numbers. You can hear a lot of storytelling in this class but storytelling with a purpose where every number in my evaluation is",
