  "text": " y This room gets progressively colder things. One is when I put the Tesla valuation of the week last week, I said, let's make this a crowd valuation, right? So there were 89 of you, maybe 93 of you who did the valuations, and thank you for doing it. So I pulled the evaluations up. I decided to do a distribution. And this might be pure coincidence, but the middle of the distribution worked out to roughly where I put out as my base case. I mean a Brazilian company. You've decided to value, and you have a choice. You can either value it in Brazilian reais, or you can value it in US dollars. how many of you think it should be in u.s dollars okay you've given me an opening to increase the value of a company then right all i'm going to do is switch to another currency with a lower risk free rate so why stop at u.s dollars why not go to japanese yen right would you like to get the same value with the two currencies it's the same company same point in time if you tell me it's cheap in dollars and expensive in reais i'm not even sure what to do your entire valuation, ignoring inflation entirely. And that seems tempting at times when inflation is high and unstable. So you know what? I'm going to ignore the problem. I'm going to remove the problem. That's called doing your analysis in real time. Sounds fancy, but you're essentially forecasting your cash flows as a company without inflation behind at your back. And getting a discount rate that's a real discount rate. So I'm going to reframe. Would you like again, if you would like to get the same value for your company nominal in real terms? I would. The analysts who most use real analyses were Latin American analysts until very recently. Almost all Latin American analysis was either done in US dollars or it was done in real terms. We asked analysts, why are you doing it in real terms? The answer was because we don't like to deal with inflation. interest rates, right? And if you ask most people the reason they give you, if you listen to CNBC, the culprit is the Fed. The Fed has kept rates low. It's one of the most absurd reaches you can think of. Sounds like the Fed must be setting rates. So this is a question we'll try to address today. Have rates stayed low in the last decade because of What role do Fed, what's the rate? And maybe you can tell me this. What's the only rate the Fed actually sets? The Fed funds rate. Everything else is set by markets, right? The Fed doesn't set US treasury rates. It doesn't set mortgage rates. So before you freak out and you say that 6% mortgage payment, don't go and do something rash at the Fed. They did not set the mortgage rate. So we're going to talk about the transmission mechanism, Smokes, you know how in the Vatican when they elect a new pope, so the Federal Open Market Committee meets in a closed room, they send smoke signals. Black smoke means rates are going up. White smoke means rates are going down. And everybody else just waits for the smoke to come out. If the Fed truly sets rates, I understand that obsession. But I'd like to dig a little deeper as to why rates were as low as they were. Final point. something is unusual, people assume that it must be wrong, and they've been trying to fix it. European analysts, for instance, have often tried to replace the negative. So when you think about negative rates, one of the things I heard over the last decade is when rates turn negative, you cannot do valuation. I want you to think about that for a moment. What is it about rates turning negative that'm going to argue that they're unusual, but they're not some strange phenomenon that should never happen. We'll talk about what it is that causes rates to be negative, and then what do you do in valuation when rates turn'm exposed to a lot of risk. Let me bring in the discount rate. But I'm going to argue that before you take that leap, step back and say, maybe not all that risk matters. You say, why not? Because risk has to be seen not through your eyes or my eyes, but through the eyes of the people who are pricing the company. I'm going somewhere with this. The risk you see in an investment is the risk it adds to your portfolio. with a lot of money who trade, which effectively means that in most companies, it's going to be some type of institutional investor, right? We can dance around this as much as we want. It could be Vanguard for one company and State Street for another and BlackRock for another. And those are investors who own not just one stock, not just 10 stocks, but often 30 or 40 or 50 stocks. People often make modern portfolio theory the enemy of valuation. This has nothing who buys just one investment. If you're a public market investor and you do that, that's your problem. I'm not going to come and bail you out, but you can see why in private businesses this can happen, right? You're a doctor who wants to buy a practice. You're a young doctor. You already have, what, a $400,000 loan from medical school. You're not exactly flush with cash, right? You take whatever wealth you have and you put it all into equity is risk you cannot diversify. Let's start with that statement. The only differences across the models is how they measure that risk. That's sort of the oldest and still most widely used risk and return model in finance. You go to every investment bank, every consulting firm. It's a capital asset pricing model of the CAP. 1964, 58 years old, 59 years old. It's showing its age. that huge an assumption. Second, you have to assume that you have no private information. That's a euphemism for you can't pick stocks. You say, why do you need those two assumptions? The argument for diversification is a common sense one, right? Spread your bets. Every additional investment is basically making that firm-specific risk get smaller and smaller. And that diversification benefit exists when you add the first stock, the second stock, live in a world where whether it's true or not, we believe we're bringing something special to the table. You see what the CAPM assumptions do? I've removed the two reasons for stopping. If I remove the two reasons for stopping, what's going to be in your portfolio? Every single traded asset in the market. That's all the CAPM you need to know. You've just derived the CAPM because once we all hold that portfolio with every do, but let's estimate a beta against each one. The arbitrage pricing model, you could have five betas, but still five factors that affect all stocks. And the factors were unnamed. It was a statistical model. That's why it's called an arbitrage pricing model. So what is factor one? It's factor one. Not particularly intuitive, right? Because who wants to pay a higher find out which companies are riskier. And we assume that markets are roughly right. The stocks that earn a high return should be riskier than stocks that earn low returns, especially over long periods. You've kind of given up on measuring risk. But then you look for proxies. Small companies earn higher returns than large companies. Therefore, they must be riskier. there's no rule here you're still measuring return that's a judgment you have to make as an investor right if you want to maximize return you have to tell me how much risk you're willing to take right you can't just you can't have an objective function with no no constraint so if that's your rule then what are you going to do you're going to go find at least in the cap m world you know what you need to do right to You borrow money, you buy the same index, your expected return will be much higher because you have less equity at play, right? So when stocks go up 10% and you pay 4% as interest, you're going to make 35%. You think, this is great. I'm going to borrow and keep borrowing. There's a downside, which is stocks don't just go up. They sometimes go down. It's a double-edged sword. potential small downside, which is you could lose it all in the next two weeks. And you come back and say, what the hell did you do? You told me to maximize returns. Never ask somebody to maximize returns without putting a subject to, I can't afford to lose more than 50% of this or 20%. The minute you add that constraint, you need five risk premiums. So you need a risk-free rate and a risk premium. And so far, your company hasn't even entered the mix, right? Those are external numbers, risk-free and risk premiums. The third input I need is how risky is your company relative to other companies? So that's the only input in this model that think two minutes. I was told the U.S. Treasury rate is a risk-free rate, and we moved on. Shows you how dollar-centric my MBA program was, and how little time we spent thinking about risk-free rates. It's not that easy. So to understand risk-free rates, I'm going to set the table. For something to be risk-free, you need to know exactly what you're going to make one-year cash flow. If you bought a T-bond a year ago, you thought you were buying a guaranteed return. T-bonds are down 18%. The return was minus 18%. Why? Because rates change. When rates change, the price of the bond changes. are risk-free in the local currency. And there's a very simple logic for that, right? Why should a government issuing a bond in the local currency? What's the rationale for why they should never default? What should they be able to do? Put more money, right? So historically in classrooms around the world and in investment banks and offices around the world, if you ask what's a risk-free rate in rupees, we take the Indian government bond rate. printing the money. What happens if you print the money? Yeah. It's not good. I double the amount of currency. I debase my currency. Devalue is just too kind of word. I debase my currency. And I'm going to make a statement. I'll try to back it up. Latin America has been the epicenter of both default and inflation for the last, what, 200 years. It's almost like they've perfected it to an art form. to issue long-term bonds denominated in reais. Do you see why? After you've had 5,500% inflation, if I try to say, I'm issuing a 10-year bond, you say, right, I'm not buying that bond. The Brazilian government could not issue 10-year bonds in reais. It took until 2006, 14 years after hyperinflation, before the Brazilian in Buenos Aires, Argentina is back again. Portfolio managed from around the world. It's almost like that collective amnesia about the last time they did this. Countries have learned that it's easier to come back from default than from debasement. you will use as a risk-free rate for evaluation. So I'm going to be very explicit because in evaluation, you're estimating cash flows next year, two years out, three years out, four years. In fact, you're estimating cash flows forever, right? So I want you to keep that in the back of your mind and tell me which of these rates you would use as a risk-free rate. A three-month T-bill rate? You know, a third of all DCFs I see use a three-month T-bill rate. Tell me what's wrong with it. What am I doing wrong? Yeah. You're doing the valuation. So you tell me how long your cash flows lasted. What happens after the end of 10 years when you're valuing a company? And what does the terminal value capture? Cash flows forever. Don't let the period that you estimate the cash flows drive your risk-free rate. This has nothing to do with it. So just because you stop in five years doesn't mean you stopped estimating cash flows. for cost of debt. I have to come up with default spreads. You know how I come up with default spreads? I find corporate bonds with the same maturity and compare them to the US T-bond. You see why I don't want to go with the 30-year T-bond? Because if I make that my base, I have to find 30-year corporates. It's really difficult to find 30-year corporates. So I'm going to go with the 10-year T-bond, even though I know I'm probably undershooting, Petrobras definitely is not risk-free. And even Disney is not risk-free. Companies have issued 100-year bonds. And governments have. The Brazilian and Canadian governments used to have console bonds. The U.S. Treasury has never gone beyond 30 years. There's no reason why they cannot. In fact, you could argue that maybe when rates were low, they should have just gone and locked it in forever. That moment has passed. Yeah. I don't want to use the 10-year rate. It's way below my one-year rate. I'm going to use the one-year rate for my one-year cash flow. So if it's going to make a difference, and you can tell mathematically if it is, then it's completely okay. In fact, it's probably the purest way of doing risk-free rates is take each cash flow and have a risk-free rate that matches that cash flow. And if you go to check a Bloomberg terminal, you can get a yield curve of zero coupons. That goes from one year to 30 years. So getting the information is easy. you get 1.5% plus whatever the inflation rate is that year. So next year inflation is 2%, you get 1.5% plus 2%, you get 3.5%. If inflation is 8%, you get 1.5% plus 8%, 9.5%. So what does that make the 1.5%? Remember I talked about real valuations and real valuations. If I were doing a valuation-free rate is. Now, in doing all of this, though, I'm making an implicit assumption that could come back to bite me, right? Which is about the U.S. Treasury. What am I assuming implicitly about the U.S. Treasury when I'm using the moment, I'm leaving it as default free, but I'm going to leave that door open just in case I change my mind. Let's move on to a different currency. So right now I'm going to use the 10-year T-bond rate. What is it at? I think it's like 3.51, 3.53, something like that. So that's going to be my risk rate for the moment. It could very quickly change in two weeks or four weeks. all of which have 10-year bond rates. Here's where they are. Which of these rates would you use as a risk-free rate and why? They're different, right? You've got to pick which one you'd use and why. No, not the answer. Because then you're saying if you did a Spanish company, you'd be using the Spanish government bond rate, right? And God help you, if you're doing a Greek company, you'd be using a Greek 10-year government bond in euros than the German 10-year bond in euros? Let's make it more specific. As a bondholder, what's the only component of risk you care about? Default, right? The rates are different because there's more default risk in some of the EU You should use the Portuguese. This has nothing to do with this being Germany. For the moment, it's Germany, but it could be whatever country has the lowest rate. And even they are saying, please, God, let there not be enough default. In fact, there are some people who argue you should use the ECB, the European Central Bank bond. It's almost exactly the German Euro bond rate. But you're looking for something default free. And here you found a country which is AAA rated, Most Indian analysts use the 7.34% as a risk-free rate in rupees. There's one stop they forgot to make before they got to their destination, right? Which is, is any of this due to perceived default risk in India? So I cheated. To answer that question, I went to Moody's. I know ratings agencies are not the sharpest knives in the drawer. They come to their conclusions too late. But it's free. BAA3 rating. Just to give you some perspective, India's rating has changed fairly dramatically towards a positive side over the last 20 years. They moved in the right direction, but BAA3 still means there's default risk, which means that 7.34% has some default risk in it, and I'd like to take it out, right? if you do that. And you're going to see what I mean by that. The second is you could take the 7.34% and add 2.69%. Is that the right way to go? Am I going in the right direction, the wrong direction? I'm actually double counting default spread, right? So the right thing to do is take the 2.69% out, which means my risk-free rate in rupees is 4.65%. You know how many people who saw my Adani valuation last week wrote me back, Currency where there's something risk-free. I'll give you, and I'll make this specific. Most of the Latin American countries issue 10-year bonds, not only in the local currency, but also in U.S. dollars. Brazil issues 10-year dollar bonds. Peru issues 10-year dollar bonds. So you can look up the rate on that bond. So if you look at Brazil, you's say the Brazilian government bond is a rate of 7% in dollar terms. That's much better than the 3.5%, right? But there's default risk. You can go to the sovereign CDS market and you can buy insurance and the insurance is quoted on a have neither a sovereign cds spread nor do they have a bond in a different currency but many of them have ratings from moody's b double a b a b%. File that away. That's my first shot at getting the default spread. Do I trust it? Depends on the trading of the bond, who's buying the bond. So I went to the sovereign CDS market and Brazil has a sovereign CDS spread that's rated. And according to the sovereign CDS market, that spread is 3.52%, much higher becomes your second estimate of the default spread. But there's one small glitch in the sovereign CDS market, which makes it difficult to read that number as a measure of pure default risk. And here's what it is. The sovereign CDS spreads for 80 countries, including countries like Switzerland. You know what? market down with them? Because what's the point of insurance if the other guy never comes through? So I'm going to do this very ad hoc adjustment. I'm going to say, look, the 3.52% you're seeing for Brazil is not entirely for default risk. There are these frictions in this market that makes it a less than pure insurance market. And the way a third shot. And in Brazil, I can try all three. Brazil has a rating of BA2. Brazil, unlike India, has gone in the wrong direction. It actually started with a higher rating 10 years ago, and in the last 10 years, the rating has kind of slid because of, you know, first the Petrobras, the car wash, etc., etc., etc., scandals, and then you had, hang in there with me. Pick one, stick with it. Because when you pick it, you're going to say, but I'm getting different answers. In fact, in the risk-free rate, the 10-year government bond rate in Brazil at the start of 2023 was 12.76%. If I net out the spread from the government bond market, my risk-free rate is 10.49% because I'm subtracting out a smaller number. If I net out the spread from the rating, the risk-free rate is 9iaz is 12.76%, and I start adjusting the risk premium for the fact that Brazil is riskier, I am counting Brazil risk twice, once in what I call my risk-free rate and once in what my risk premium is. So once you've picked your company, if it's in a country where there is no default free entry, you're lucky if you're in the dollars or euros or Swiss. some two or three, some you're stuck with just one. And you're saying, what if I'm valuing a Syrian company? God help you. But no, we'll come back and talk about what to do about Syrian companies. But maybe getting a risk-free rate might not be the biggest of your problems. Any questions on the cleaning up? So we'll come back and we'll revisit these spreads. Now, let me go back to doing things in real terms. I said, one of the world operates in a nominal basis, right? Your taxes are based on nominal income. You know where you're going to be doing real analyses? You're in Ghana, you're in Zimbabwe. You're saying, look, I can't deal with inflation here. You're saying, but I can't find something like the tips rate in Zimbabwe. Trust me, don't even look, you will not find it. I'm going to give an easy way to get a risk-free rate no matter where you are in the world, but then I'm freely, that the real risk-free rate in Ghana could be higher. But I can't think of an easy way to get a real risk-free rate in a currency. My suggestion, if you're really stuck and you're valuing a company in Ghana, do it in South African rand. Currency is a choice. You can value any company in any currency. give you the big picture. So you saw what I did with the Brazilian RIAI and the Indian rupee to get a risk-free rate in the two currencies, right? At the start of every year and midway through each year, I tried to get risk-free rates in every currency where there is a 10-year government bond available. So notice the add-on there. Not every government has 10-year bonds outstanding. So about 45 currencies where you can get a 10-year rates, some currencies have low risk-free rates, and some can have negative risk-free rates. So here's the question that's going to crack the currency code. I know I've been promising this all the way through this class. Why do risk-free rates vary across currencies? see inflation is going to be like a wind at your back. You value a Zambian company. Don't be surprised to see 20% growth, even though it's a mature, slow-growing company, because with 15% inflation, you're going to get this high growth number. Your cash flows will have high growth. Your discount rate will be high, high, high, cancel out. If you take that same company and decide to value euros, it's true your discount can just sit on it for the rest of eternity. It makes up this stuff. I mean, let's say you valued a company a year ago. And let's assume nothing's changed in the company. It's got the same earnings, the same cash flows, the same growth rate. You value the company today. Will your intrinsic value be different today than a year ago? What's changed? treasury rates collapse. You went from 1.7% T-bond rates to 0.7%. Your T-bond rates went to zero. It is what it is. Complaining about it doesn't make it go away. It is a fact of life. Rates can change and rates change. Your value changes. And my advice to you is to have a separate input page where you keep things like T-bond rates. See, what do we do then? Seven years ago, I was valuing an Egyptian bank. I don't know why. I must have come up with something that I was asked that I was trying to do. And I wanted to value the bank in Egyptian pounds. So an Egyptian pound risk-free rate. it was about 15%. See where I'm going to go next, right? Take the difference. If you're in a hurry, just take the 13.5% difference, add it to the T-bond rate. You've got a risk-free rate in Egyptian pounds. In fact, the reason I do a little messier is because things compound, inflation is on top of a real rate. It gives you a slightly higher number, but you can see that you can come pretty close just by adding the differential inflation rate for Egypt. What's the mistake I've made? I've come up too low a risk-free rate in Egyptian pounds, too low a discount rate, right? But then when I estimate the cash flows, I use 15% that's too low an inflation rate. It's great to have mistakes that average out. And on macro variables, this is what I'm looking for. I tell people, look, people talk about normal as if it's a number we all agree. And one of the tests I would run when I did these sessions the last decade is I'd go in and people say, that's a low rate. It's much lower than a normal rate. And I said, what's a normal rate? Someone said 6%. I said, you've been in the market way too long. If you started in markets in 1980s, what you think of as normal is framed by is nonsensical because normal based on what history you look at. But in this case, the tendency people have is to take a current rate because it looks too low and replace it with a normalized rate. How about taking an average over 30 years by looking at what they saw as rates 30 years ago? Do you think that's a good idea to normalize risk-free rates? Let's say I'd done this a year ago. something you mess with. Risk-free rates. If you want to normalize margins, normalize growth, go ahead and do it. But don't normalize risk-free rates. This is an actual opportunity cost you face right now. So I don't care whether you think rates are too low or rates are too high or what you think the Fed will do. In valuation, the safest place to be when you think about risk-free rates is whatever the current rate is. You're not saying the market is right. You're saying, but that's what I will have Fed building downtown. It's in Marine Street or somewhere in the downtown area, and they take you on a tour. The most exciting part is when they take you down to the Mint, and you can see all this cash, don't get any ideas. It's well protected. Unless you're part of Ocean 17 or 18, and this is the big heist you're going to pull off. I almost made myself persona non grata right at the start funds rate. You can try, but it's not going to work. It's an overnight borrowing rate for banks. It's not for you and I. The Fed doesn't set rates. It sets a Fed funds rate. So where does this illusion about the Fed setting rate? It's because you, you know, I don't know whether, have I ever told you the story of Chanticleer? I'll tell you the story. It's actually a fun story. It's about a rooster who actually is viewed come up. You say, what's this got to do with the Fed? What do we say causes rates to be different? Inflation, right? The Fed is, if you think about interest rates in general, it's an equation called the Fisher equation. It's one of the first things you're taught in Econ 101. Fisher equation says if you have a nominal interest rate, there are two components to it. There's an expected inflation and an expected real interest rate. So here's what Absolutely. At the margin, I estimated the Fed effect has to be about 0.25% over the entire from. It's like the Wizard of Oz. Your power comes from the perception of your power. And God help you if people lose faith in that perception. Happened to the Japanese central bank about 30 years ago. For the last 30 years, you know what the Japanese central bank's effect on markets has been? Nothing. Once you lose that power, you've lost every piece of control you have. and Swiss franc, but the risk-free rates turn negative. That makes people uncomfortable. In fact, the rationale that people did for not valuing companies, if I use a negative risk-free rate, I'm going to end up with a really low discount rate. Yes. But complete the story. You're going to end up with a really low discount rate. But what are you discounting? Cash flows in the same economy, right? And if you have an economy with negative risk-free rates were negative because I tried to make sure that whatever cost rates to be negative were also reflected in my expected cash flows. So I'm going to stop there because risk-free rates, I mean, I know I started this by saying, let's take the easiest of the inputs. And if this is what the easiest of the inputs look like, you're probably saying, I hate to see what the more difficult inputs look like. But I think this",
