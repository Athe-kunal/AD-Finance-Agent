{"text": " um. Next week, as you know, Monday is a holiday, President's Day, so there will be no class on Monday. And because Monday is on a holiday, I've decided to go back home for the week, which is home for me is La Jolla, California. So I'm going home tomorrow morning. I don't want to come back just for a Wednesday class. So this is all about me anyway. So it'll be a Zoom session next Wednesday. and I pride myself on being a realist, which is I would love for you to be obsessed with this class and forget about all your other classes, the rest of your life, your family, your friends, but that's not going to happen. It's probably not healthy if it happens. So the email I would send you, I've already done this for my corporate finance class, but I'll send it after this, will essentially list out what I think is realistic given your time constraints. zero to three hours this is what you should do three to six here's what you should be doing six to ten then obviously you can do valuations a week weekly challenges and if you're one of those people who ends up being obsessed with a class and time is no longer a constraint you don't have to sleep for 15 weeks you're willing to just spend it all in valuation i've given you a template of what to do as well but decide you can ask questions directly from sitting in the lobby. I would say find a much nicer place than this room to sit in if you're just going to watch the Zoom. But, you know, it'll be like a regular class, you know, just be a live class. You can put up your hand, you can ask questions. In fact, there's a little more interaction on Zoom than it is in person because, you know, you often turn your face off so got nothing to do with your grade. So you have to decide what you want to take out of the class. I'm not going to prejudge it for you because you have a life to live, constraints to meet. So today we're going to talk about, we're going to finish the discussion of equity risk premiums, and we're going to talk about paydus. it's made to seem like a fact, right? I mean, so I'm going to first test that proposition. If beta is obtained by running a regression of returns in a stock against returns in a market index, then let's go look at what that regression looks like. I don't know how many of you have had a chance to access a Bloomberg terminal. I was told this morning there's one on the fourth floor. Find a Bloomberg terminal, pick your company, and type in the word beta. There'll be a beta page that pops up. against the Sensex, German company against the DAX. We'll talk about whether that's good or bad, but that's a regression I got. So that's a regression to the left. But remember, I can go change the parameters. So I said, okay, it's Petrobras. Why don't I take the ADR, which is the dollar-based security and run a regression against the S&P 500? There's my Petrobras ADR. So I'm going to ask you a question. This is going to start unraveling the entire myth gives you letter but you do you have an alternate view depends upon what base you want to pick if we are higher square may not be the right so tell me something tell me so you pick a base and tell me give give me an alternate answer i mean if we are evaluating into s and b there's only one valuation you're going to get right so frame yourself so pick whatever role you want to play and give me crappy. A, because they're not capturing risk in Petrobras, because ultimately what's your objective? To find a true beta. There can't be 17 true betas. There's got to be one. You say, which one of these? And second, I think again, remember we talked about forgetting statistics when we did historical risk premiums and a big Achilles heel with historical risk premiums with its standard error. I'm going to pull that card out of the deck again. absurd. Do you think in my Tesla valuation that my beta was my big assumption? It wasn't even in my top 10 list, to be quite honest. But people focus in because they just don't like betas. It's deep. It's deeply entrenched. People could be analysts, could be investors. Warren Buffett has been famous for saying, you know, he just doesn't like betas. Charlie Munger uses even more salty language. And that's why he says he uses salty language for pretty much everything surprising number of investors see where the 10 came from i have no idea but it's got firmly lodged in this person's head and guess what when i put out my cost of capital this year the median cost of capital for a company was around 10 they said there i told you so this is like a clock that's stuck at 12 o'clock point of how come you're using a pricing-based measure of risk to do an intrinsic valuation. Isn't it inconsistent? And it's in a sense inconsistent, right? Because if I believe in intrinsic value, maybe I should use some intrinsic number, maybe earnings, maybe cash flows, look at the variance over time. and the final argument is a mechanical argument which is you're okay with the price using prices you're okay with the diversified investor assumption you just don't like the mechanics of how we estimate betas because as you saw with petrobras it's not a number it's a range of numbers depending on the choices you make the reason i push people to tell me what makes them uncomfortable or betas is the solution i'm going to offer is going to be very different depending and finish up our discussion of equity risk groups. So we started with historical risk premiums, and we very quickly concluded that it's a great way to look at risk backwards, but it's not forward-looking, it's not dynamic. I gave you the alternative implied equity risk premiums. I don't know whether I convinced you or not, but at least I want you to start you need a forward looking premium, especially given your mission, which is to value a company given where the market is today. And the response I would get at many of those places, it doesn't matter that much. You say, what do you mean it doesn't matter? You say, all our analysts use the same equity risk premium. And as long as we use the same equity risk premium, what does it matter if it is wrong? So I want to push you on that premise. You're pushing it up above what it should be. You're pushing down the value and every single stock you value is going to look over value. You can't live as an equity research analyst with that, right? So you know what they do. They play games with the earnings and the growth rates to get to a buy. It's an extraordinarily unhealthy thing to do, but you can see why it happens. If I impose a discount rate that really cannot be justified in the market then, let's say it's 5%, and you decide to use 4%, and you find your company to be undervalued and you ask me to buy, I'm going to push back and ask you, do you want me to buy this company because it's undervalued, or do you want me to buy this company because you think the S&P 500 should be 25? Because implicitly, by using a 4% premium, you're sending me a message about the overall A good measure of equity risk premium should be a reasonably good forecaster of what equity markets will do in the future. In other words, if I give you the equity risk premium now and I give you what returns are in the next 10 years, a good equity risk premium has been roughly two times the BAA default spread. So the BAA default spread is 2.5%. It's a very simplistic way, but you can say, look, I can go observe the BAA spread in the market, double it, and it becomes my equity risk premium. And then I check to see how well these four approaches forecast future returns by looking at the correlation with the actual returns next year, the actual returns in the next five years, why people are so stuck at historical premiums. But I think one reason is they've lost the script. This is not about getting a number for last year. It's about forecasting the future and it does the worst. And if you look across the other numbers, you can see actually why I stick with current implied premiums. It turns out that smoothing it out might make you feel better, but it's not giving you a better forecast. The current implied premium actually Go back to the S&P 500 calculation. I need a level for the index right now, right? I need to know what the cash flows were on the company's dividends and buybacks last year. And I need forecasted growth on these dividends and cash flows. I don't need any historical data. I could do this a growing market. And that's fine. That's an estimation issue. When I solve for the IRR, I's useful to compute this premium, especially for a market like India. Last session, when I computed equity risk premiums by country, and I started with a mature market premium and added spreads and added equity risk premiums, I was taking the perspective of an investor who has global choices. the U.S. market is giving me a much better equity risk premium. It's not like you can go online and buy me a thousand shares of Facebook. You might buy a mutual fund and there are some in India that offer you U.S. exposure. And even that's an improvement over 10 or 15 years ago where Indian investors had only one choice. You could invest in Indian stocks or Indian stocks. state. Real estate is a bubble. It bursts. You go to gold. You have this moving bubble all over the place because you have no escape hatch. China is a variant of the same problem. They've tried for the last 20 years to open up investments for Chinese domestic investors outside, but there are still significant constraints. You say, why hasn't're assuming you have to invest in an Indian company. So my guess is I will find probably 20% of Indian companies undervalued, even if the Indian investor finds, because as an outsider, I have choices. I don't have to invest in Asian paints. And then I download every publicly traded stock in the world. This is the nice thing about S&P Capital IQ. It takes me 20 minutes to download 300 data items on every single one of 47, just like I did for the S&P 500, across those 25,000 developed market stocks and the 21,000 emerging market stocks. So let me go back to the start of 2004. Start of 2004, if you looked at how developed market stocks were priced and think about computing an implied return, the order in dollar terms, I can compare apples to apples, 7.28%. Emerging market stocks in the same day, 10.55%. markets. You might not remember the stories that were being told them, but the story was 2008 has changed the game. There is no such thing as a developed or an emerging market. We're all emerging markets, we're all developed markets, depending on the story you want to tell. Brazilian stocks, Indian stocks, US stocks, German stocks, who really cares where you're from? And markets had pushed the expected returns down. Now, I didn't buy into that me Spain. I'm not sure which country should go on which side of the divide because the differences have started to kind of melt. So it's a number that I track just to get a sense of what's happening across markets. But it's again that technique of computing an implied expected return that I wanted to take away. So any questions at all about equity risk premiums? I'm kind of done companies. Second, no matter how well you run a regression, it's looking backwards, right? So if your business makes this change as a company, you're changing as a company, your beta, even if it's right, is not going to capture your company as it is today. It's going to capture your company as it was over the last five years, the last two years. And third, whenever you compute a regression beta, embedded in there is how much debt did you two years into its listing. And I got a number, right? So if you look at Bloomberg's description page for GoPro, it have reflected, it have shown a beta 1.4. And that's one reason you have to be careful about that descriptive page because they picked a number out of this regression. First, that's really not the regression beta. It involved you know what the adjusted beta is for every company in bloomberg it's a raw beta times two-thirds if you don't trust me pick up any company look it up it's a raw beta times two-thirds plus one-third times one you see what the regression beta is 1.8 i'll make it 1.53 1.5 will become 1.33 0.6 will become 0.73'd get a prize, right? 93% R squared. Standard error close to zero. Every point is on the line. But the reason is very simple. Take a look at the index. I'll be quite honest. When I ran this regression, I thought I was regressing against a witch's curse. So the hex has always been to me. You know what the hex stands for? The Helsinki exchange. You're saying, what the heck lot of the time the two move together surprise but this is a completely useless regression right because you know who the largest single investor in nokia was in 2000 was barclays as part of the global index fund if you're adding nokia to your portfolio near your global index fund you're not going to run the regression against the hex you're going to run it against the msci and guess what you're going to find a big step standard errors I looked up the beta pitch. You know what Bloomberg told me the beta for GameStop was? Minus 0.62. They were telling me to liquidate all my treasuries and put my money in GameStop. It's beyond riskless. It actually is going to, it's nonsensical. You know why it's beta turned negative, right? What does beta measure? It measures how much your stock moves in relation to be different. You think, who cares? Remember we talked about bias at the start of this class? This is an instrument for bias, right? You want to increase the value of your company, sit in front of a Bloomberg, keep playing with the index, starting point, ending point, weekly, monthly, until you get a really low beta. Print that page off because that'll document the biggest reason that many value investors don't value companies, which strikes me as a strange thing. You claim to be a value investor, but you don't value companies. They'll tell you it's because they don't like betas. This is like saying you don't like a surgeon because he has no hair. He's not operating you with his head. He's using his hands. You're picking the wrong argument. You don't like betas. no, no, I believe in price-based measures, then I can give you alternatives, CAPM, the arbitrage pricing model, the multi-factor models. I'm also going to ask you, do you believe that risk should be measured through the eyes of an investor who's diversified? And if you say, no, I don't like that, then I'm going to come up with measures of how to adjust that risk for the fact that investors are not diversifying. In other words, you tell me what am I going to do with 50%? I'm going to compute that standard deviation for every company in the market. Not difficult to do. And then let's say the average across companies is 20%. So your company standard deviation is 50%. The average company standard deviation is 20%. I'm going to divide the 50 by the 20. I'm going to end up with a number that looks like a beta, right? 2.50. are proxy models. Now, one of the, we'll talk about some of the ways traditionally services of classified companies, but often they use proxies. And finally, there's a third set of models called CAPM plus models. So what are those? The CAPM, you have a risk-free rate plus beta times risk-free, right? Let's say you plug the numbers in and you come up with a cost of equity of 8% for your company. You look and say, that looks too low. premiums till you get to a number. I feel good with that. Which my response is, why don't you just use that number in the first place? Why go through the charade of acting like you used to risk it? You wanted to use 20%. Use the damn 20%. Don't look for ways to get there by acting like you're using a model. But that's a fact. In fact, desperation time is when analysts add what's called a company-specific risk premium. Now you're replacing betas with an accounting number and say i trust that as my basis for risk services used to come up with these ranking systems for you know value line which is around So what I'm saying is don't let betas become your battlefield. Don't argue with people about using betas. It's not worth the effort. It's not going to create the kind of consequence you want. So ask them what they would use instead. Then try to make it into a scale measure and move on. But I'm going to take you back to what I think is a more healthy discussion of betas. service, your customers cannot live without. So I'd expect grocery stores to have lower betas than discount retailers. Discount retailers to have lower betas than department stores, and department stores to have lower betas than luxury retailers. In fact, in econ, what do we do? How do we measure discretion? There's an econ term for it, right? It's elasticity of demand. Every other class you take is in service of this class. You can see why you take an econ class. because think of the cost structure for an airline. Almost everything is fixed. Hotels, high beta business. Unless you have an entrant who decides to bypass and have a very different business model. So who's disrupted the hotel business? Airbnb, right? We can debate about Airbnb's future, but one thing they bring to the table is a more flexible cost structure. So in 2020, when COVID hit and the hospitality business shut down, get more volatile, your beta will reflect it. So rather than think of what does Bloomberg tell me the beta for my company is, start off by thinking about what your company does. I'll be serious. Don't even look at a beta. Say if I were reasoning my way to a beta for this company, would I expect to see a high beta, an average beta or a low beta? That's the opening I'm going to use to try to come up difference in operating leverage. So you're Southwest, you have much lower fixed costs than a typical airline. I want to adjust your beta for those lower fixed costs. But I'll tell you the practical challenge you're going to face in adjusting for operating leverage. But there's an information problem. I challenge you to open up the income statement for any company in the world and tell me, based on the income statement, which costs are fixed and which are variable. Because accountants don't break things into fixed and variable. There's cost of goods sold. There's SG&A. You can try to guess and say SG&A is probably fixed. Cost of goods sold is probably variable. But really, there's no and there's equity. Everything in market value terms, because beta is a market risk-driven concept. I'll give you the conventional way in which you adjust for betas. It's 50 years plus old, but I'll give you the limits of the approach and why some people have trouble with. Basically, the way you adjust for betas, you start with the unlevered beta. So think of the unlevered beta as a beta coming out of the business area and after adjusting for operating levels. So you have a number. And then I ask the non-diversifiable risk in a company, a market risk in a company is borne by just the equity investors. Put differently, the beta of debt is zero. Not that debt is riskless, but it has no market risk attached. Which if you're a triple A, double A, single A, even a triple B, a company is not a bad assumption because what drives that trade is interest rates and default spreads, not what's happening in the company. my beta for that because effectively I'm sharing my risk with the lenders. That's effectively what I'm doing is I'm taking risk that used to be entirely on my shoulders and say, hey, you guys share some of this risk. If you're interested in estimating beta debt, I actually have an entire section and I'll send you that section. I never use it because I have never felt the urge to adjust for the beta debt. But if you have somebody who's a purist says, I need a beta debt, I need to adjust it. Again, the mechanism exists if you choose to take it. So casino tobacco, I want a beta for my company. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go find as many publicly traded casino companies as I can. Let's say I find a hundred casino companies and as many publicly traded. What does my other sin tobacco, a hundred tobacco companies. So publicly traded. So what can I look up for each of them? I can look up a beta for each of them. Hang in there. You see, but you told me you don't like regression betas. I'm going to start. I end up with an unlevered beta for being in casinos and unlevered beta for being in tobacco. I come back to you and say, well, how much value did you get from each of these businesses? And your reaction might be, I don't know how much value I got, but I can tell you how much revenues I got. 70% from casinos, 30% from tobacco. You know what I'm going to do next? I'm going to take a weighted average. I now have an unlevered beta for your company. Then ask your final question. Do you have any debt? Terrifically bad betas. And I take the average of those 100 betas. You know what the standard error of the average is going to be? I pick the sample size deliberately as 100. It's called the law of large numbers. You take the typical standard error, 0.5. You divide by the square root of the number of companies you have, which is square root of 100 is 10. 100 crappy betas, and the average is magically precise. problem. That's a risk premium problem. You're going to get a far more precise. Second, if I entered the casino business yesterday, there's no chance a regression beta can reflect it, right? But when I do a bottom-up beta, not only can I reflect the weights of the businesses you're in today, you plan to be in the fossil fuel business next year, I can bring that into your weights. I control the process now. I'm not at the mercy of some Bloomberg beta page. two quick examples so you can see this process player. It's a beta page that I use in my corporate finance class, a company I use as Vale. They're in four businesses. They're a Brazil-based mining company, largest iron ore mining company in the world, but they also have businesses in metals and mining, fertilizers and logistics. So I broke them down into four businesses. I went looking for publicly traded companies in each up their enterprise values and the revenues and computed a multiple of revenues you multiply what vale gets as revenues from each business by that you get an estimated value i know this is a long way to what seems like something that you could look up on bloomberg but those weighted the the weighted average that you get across those betas 0.84 is my a very different beta for theme parks and for streaming. I now have the capacity to compute a cost of equity and capital for every business separately. It's a simple tool. 50 years ago, the data would have been the biggest impediment, right? How the heck am I going to look up betas for 25 companies? For those of you who haven't signed up for S&P Capital IQ, value, right? Just market value. Each of the 48 companies is a revenue. So I divide the enterprise value by revenue for each of the 48 companies. I take the median across the companies. You don't have to, right? What do I need from the financial statements? Revenue. But enterprise value just is market value equity plus debt minus cash. So it's four data items, basically, all of which are among the most observable. You can look up Yahoo Finance. for that is right go to an intrinsic valuation of every one of the 638 companies not going there and there's some things in valuation we got to say look i'm going to do the best i can but beyond that it's going to take a reach that i'm not willing to do but the alternative is to just use revenues which is effectively saying the enterprise value to sales for every come every every company the word is i would rather take mis, there's a quick and dirty way you can convert book debt to market debt. But remember, book debt and market debt are not going to be hugely different unless your interest rates change in a dramatic way. Book equity and market equity is where the real fight is fought. Yes. Part of the debt is not trade. It's not bonds. It's bank debt. Therefore, we're going to use book debt. Equity, you don't have that. If it's a publicly traded company, there is a market value. No, because otherwise, as you said, it's a Pandora's box of adjusting. Then we'll have to come back to that because then I don't think even that book value makes sense. But since there's no market value left to come up with a solution, that's one of the things we'll debate about. Hey, what do you do at private companies when you don't have a market value? want. You do weekly betas, you do monthly betas, you do daily betas. It's amazing. The numbers all look roughly the same because, as I said, the divergences average out. This is why when you do an individual company, your choices matter a great deal. You say, should I go back two years or five years? Should I do daily or weekly or monthly? Because your choices make a difference. If you're doing bottom-up betas, be sloppy. It's going to be okay. Sloppiness cuts both ways. And this is, I think, to open this door on, because many people, when they take this approach, assume that you have to find companies in the same market doing the same thing to get a beta. So I'd estimate a beta for Embraer. Embraer is an aerospace company. There's the unlevered beta coming from looking at global aerospace companies. Now, if you go to Capital IQ, you can American companies? I'm going to look at aerospace companies globally. Not a huge sample even then, right? But I get at least some companies coming. And this makes some people uncomfortable. They say, it's a Brazilian company. How can you use the betas for US companies or European companies? Here's a counter that I would offer and be willing to use this counter on anybody who asks this question. indonesian companies indian companies european companies and put i can't do this with most other metrics i can't do it with price earnings ratios i can't do it with with numbers with our but betas i should be and that's a good thing because imagine working for a bolivian analyst and saying look i'm going to stay with just bolivian companies to do my bottom-up beta good luck with that because what does the law of large numbers require what business is Facebook in? Please don't say social media. Advertising. You think Facebook invented advertising? No, it's been around for as long as people have been around. When you want to make the argument that there's a new, maybe they're more fixed cost, a friend, you want to adjust the advertising beta, be my guest. But this notion that somehow you have a company that's never been tried before is delusional because every company is in a business that's been around But Embraer actually has more cash than debt at the time that I did this. If I computed a net debt ratio, the net debt ratio would have been minus 3.32%. Don't try to fix the minuses. I don't like minuses. If you do net debt ratios, they can be negative. Apple has a negative net debt ratio. What does that mean? My levered beta is actually going to be lower than my unlevered beta. Now, by itself, this looks momentous, right? is now I'll bring in the 16% of Embraer that comes from debt and I give it a much lower cost. My cost of capital is going to come down. If I use a net debt ratio though, and I get to the cost of capital stage, tell me what the cost of capital calculation is going to look like for Embraer. You're going to have a cost of equity based on the net. What's my equity ratios going? If it's based on net debt, it's actually going to be greater than 100%, right? So it took us a long time to get to this end page. But we talked about three numbers, right? For the last three sessions, risk-free rates, equity risk premiums, betas. Each is trying to convey a singular message. What does the risk-free rate convey? It conveys what you can make on a guaranteed basis on your currency of choice. That's what risk-free rates are there for. They're not there to show you how risky you are as a country or what business you're going to stay in control if not you can very quickly start to double count triple count, quadruple count things you shouldn't be counting so I will see you on Zoom a week from today and have a great presidency I just want to make sure I was understanding why it's important to just think through whether or not investors are diversified. Is that because when you're looking at your new investment, you're assuming that all the betas, still each company individually should be then regressed against their own index. Again, the advantage of large numbers. But only if you assume... That's right. You have to regress every regression that you run against a global index. A global index. You take all 47,000 companies, regress them all against a global index. But not everyone against the S&P. Then you would just be assuming that the S&P is the average, which is... Right. The beta is the average. So if you look at everything against the S&P, and you were doing it in dollar terms, you'd see the beta is going to be that different than if you did it against the MSCI. Because the S&P is 40% of global equity in the end, right? If you look at the US equity. So the MSCI is about 60% because they have such a set of... Yeah, who finance standard. Against a global index. But I think that it matters less and less as you go. Normalizing it will give you normalizing against the average. It's completely missing the diversified events today. Okay, so if you give me a measure, you have nothing to do with it. Thank you. When you're calculating a lever data and you're talking about the market value, the book value of 10, so what is the ideal way thing to do. Because you're not assuming that they will not pay, you're just assuming that the value is the present value. What you're doing is you're going down the enterprise value to the credit. Right now, I think we overestimate the value to spread companies by using the credit. You take Bed Bath and Beyond. Yeah. The way they can be the enterprise value, they take the market debt, they take the total debt on the books. Yeah. They subtract that cash. Yeah. And they go, oh, the enterprise value looks too high. Yeah. Because you screwed up with the total debt. True, true. problem is that cash flows continue to decline, in which case on the cash flow. It's not the debt that's keeping you in your debt, it's the fact that you essentially have a business that's trying to drop. You're trying to, see the problem is that we want to lose higher discount rates for distressed companies. We can't do that. We can't do rate and drop now. And the problem is that analysts want to adjust the discount rate, that's why they don't need the discount rate to end game of health. Your margins are dropping, your revenues are shrinking. It's a cash flow problem in value. Okay. So I understand that concept, but then I'm just thinking on the maths over here, the cost of debt that you're taking, and I get that the enterprise value should actually have the market value of debt because it's kind of the market value of the risk period. But why is that? For example, if Bed Bath & Beyond has, let's say, a term loan for 10 years or 15 years, and they have a fixed, let's say, term loan. And that's, let's say... The cost of debt is an opportunity. The question is, if I invested that money elsewhere, what would I make today? 5% years ago, I'm going to lock it in at my cost of death. I'm going to end up with too low a discount. I think it reflects the reality that in bed back and beer, but maybe that needs evaluation. You face all these challenges of the market. The first side looks like you're better than me. You're making a debt ratio. And I'm not because I'm going to push the cost of that up. Respect the fact that it's a really risky country. happen in any way right okay so i'm using a service code which means i'm at the mercy of whatever they're okay so in fact they're unleveraged no regression is nothing yeah it's given that they're left you always have to clean up those so you can assume that they were never under the base so you're on leopard by taking the average that they could or the media i mean they're statistical choice the reason averages can be tricky especially with small small effects This is standard for US services. It uses the European index. It doesn't use local indices. So it actually does better than Bloomberg in that venue because these local indices are 30 stocks and you know what your Siemens doesn't always look like. You know it's because you are the emerging markets. I think they were from, I've written to it is there, but the fix for me is to adjust S&P Capital like two betas to make them at least follow the basic round one number. I go with those. The second room is average weight people. The third room is full of underweight people. You obviously can't put the weights across. But what if I took every person in every room and divided by the average weight of the person? I'm going to get a relative weight person. So I said, you know, find me the people with the highest relative weight. But if you have like two different companies in two different geographies, but let's say 1.2 beta, they don't have the same. They should have the same. Risk comes from business and fixed costs. I mean, but let's say one of these indices is actually filled with more companies with let's say fixed costs. So they have to have, let's say, higher beta in general. But operating leverage is not, that's going to be more business. The operating leverage is a, is a multiplier. to get enough companies like India and China. Because there will be cases where you say an Indian retail company is really not like a retail company in terms of regulatory restrictions and things like that. So I'm going to focus in on regional data for that reason. But make it a great reason. The right reasons are the business itself, it's changing its characteristics. But very much to do with indices. By the time you get to these big indices, yes, people are all going to be brainwashed. Amateurs actually want the industry. They want it to be strange. It's a U.S. industry. You have UPS and things like that. You have home buyers. It's not even home buyers. This is complete. They've lost the script. They will actually say it's a U.S. investor. No, U.S. investors have global choices. I mean, I might choose to invest in U.S. companies. So it wasn't even something that's reasonable to invest in the home buyers, that's what we're doing again. It's just the fact. services. It's only in the last 25 years, but they just took what bar did with us companies and replicated on the local basis in every month. That's basically what the portfolio about that. Even the adjustment to what one is a bar I just it's starting in 1970s. So I think there's no good reason for what life services do what they do. I didn't the fact that there's a non-dollar company. But you can even adjust the returns to make a dollar return. So I think it's number one. We have the capacity to do it. The only problem is doing it for myself with 47,000 companies. You know, I've been spending 365 days and not required that. It's a big thing. But I think, you know, we have this mess of faith in terms of how because AT&T is a company that's changed so much over its life. And even though you have history, it's not capturing the operating leverage today. So you don't take. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Most of the processes. Why? Because. Most of the processes are very difficult. Because the way it makes the content, it is based on. So you just have to look at their operations. That's the thing about the business. And that's the thing about it. Thank you so much. Thanks so much, Manish. So now that India has imposed 20% pieces on investing in the money stocks, how is it going to affect the prices? But if you look at the demographic, the number of people who trade, I mean, invest in foreign stocks within 1 lakh to 10 lakhs is nearly 50% of what is being done. So, I mean, they are not able to get this opportunity now. No, but the first line item would be sales received by cash receiving center. Yeah. Yeah. So basically they're controllable, right?
