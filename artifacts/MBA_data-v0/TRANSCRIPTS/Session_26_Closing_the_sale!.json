{"text": " okay that's fine I think 10 people who did not turn it in, but you still have time to get the numbers in so you don't lose the five points. But everything you're going to see will reflect your numbers. You know how you have those disclaimers on emails that you get saying, I'm not responsible for any of this stuff here. So I've just taken your numbers. So if you screwed up and added an extra zero, I just left the extra zero in because, you know. So I'm going to show about what you've turned in. And I'm going to use your presentation as kind of the lead-in to this class. So if you think back to the start of the class, I said there are three ways you can put a number on an asset. People like option models. And I let you pick your own companies. I really did not restrict you on what you could do. But if you go back to the core of what we were doing in intrinsic valuation, essentially, we were trying to estimate the value as a function of questions you ask about a company. It shows up as a model, as an equation, expected cash flows divided by discount rate, but embedded in there are answers to questions like, what are your cash flows from existing assets? That's where we always start, right? you see an Excel spreadsheet in your DCF model, step back and say, what are the answers that the analyst is giving to these questions? And do I agree with those answers? And of course, in my version of the model, which I kind of forced on you, and I did it partly for my own purposes, made my life easy because I wasn't checking a hundred spreadsheets from scratch. There are three drivers of your cash flows. Your, next year, two years from now, three years from now, five years from now, and then you estimate cash flows forever. That's a going concern. Why is that a problem? If there is a chance your company will not make it because it's distressed, it could be nationalized, terrorist attack could wipe it out, then you've got to bring it in explicitly to a failure risk. lower values because one of those inputs is essentially a number that you don't like. So those are the drivers of that. And early on, we talked about, hey, you can make whatever assumptions you want about each of the inputs, but your valuation has to be internally consistent. Consistency is what you can check for. What does that mean? You want to assume a high growth rate. It's your company, your story. As long as you're not making your company bigger than the market, valuations off the tracks is when you pick one input and just move it up and down as if you're in complete control. I talked about how when something lowers your cost, your first instinct is I'm going to give the company higher margins. What's the question you need to ask before you give them higher margins? Are your costs and only your costs lowered or everybody's costs lower? This is why I don't buy the AI pitch, which is if AI comes along, everybody's going to get more on lululemon you think that this is the biggest most dominant company in the world and it should nvidia made it to the top list this year which it hasn't before so it tells you something about no and we'll talk about what it is that lets you know when you pick the company remember you didn't do it randomly right you picked it based on something my guess is you have a lot of momentum companies in your portfolio because they caught your attention right the companies are 50 percent companies. First, the date you did your DCF varied, you know, because I know for some of you, there was this question, first quarter reports are just starting to come out. And I, you know, I got at least a couple of emails last week asking, a first quarter report just came out, do I need to update the numbers? And I said, you don't need to, I'm not going to penalize you in terms of points. But if you're going to put real as well, but it wasn't, I would think. It's almost like you can see people picking it up. It's what I use. Why didn't I do it? So DCF perspective, you were finding a lot more overvalued than undervalued companies. And here was the list of the most undervalued company, according to you, is Upwork, undervalued by about 75%. You can go down the list. You're saying what happened in Aviana? I think that the person doing it made the value of the pricing, but they either couldn't make up their mind about buy or sell, or they forgot there was a row out there. But again, I don't want to play editorial here. macroeconomic environment. And I would add one more thing. Can a valuable bank become worth nothing in a week? What has to happen? Deposits leave, right? With a bank, that's always, you're worried, sticky deposits. So one of the things I wrote about in banking is what drives the value of a bank is how sticky your deposits are. What determines stickiness of deposits? So you look at diversity of deposit. Regional banks are more likely to have deposit runs than national banks because you're in a particular region, people panic. They see lines outside a bank and other people join in. It's also going to be driven by growth. Growing banks will have less sticky deposits. Why? Because it's like you've seen cohort analysis that if somebody stays on a service for longer, they're more likely. With Citi, I'm less concerned than I am with a regional bank. It's a national bank. It's a boring, stodgy, badly run bank. But it's priced to be, and even worse, a boring, horrifically run bank. And if you can buy a bank that's badly run and it's priced as it's horrifically run, you're getting a bargain. But with banks, I can understand. If you find a regional bank to be underval your story. Here's the story. That, I mean, ultimately, the old way in which newspapers, which is through circulation, advertising is breaking down, right? Online advertising is coming in. In fact, you see this almost with most traditional newspapers. What's allowed the New York Times to stay above the fray? What have they done? by the New York Times not to read the news, but to do the crossword. I know it sounds weird, but they've essentially, I mean, but you can see that one of the few newspapers that's done something, but in the story that's being told here, all of that comes to naught because the digital version. So it's a plausible story, but it's almost overvalued. And you can go down the list and essentially gain the percentage overvaluation is captured of intrinsic valuation is the weight. I'll tell you what I find. If you look across the years, on average, there is no, it's beyond, so this might sound like a song, you beat randomness. Randomness would be 50-50 shots. About 60% of buy recommendations go up and only 45% go down. It's not a hundred and zero. So it's not perfect, obviously. And he looked at what your returns would have looked like if you took the top 10 stocks out of every year. You'd have made less than the T-bill rate if you took the top 10 stocks out of every year. Now, you can look at it and say, that's why I pick stocks. But you can also look and say, that's why I don't pick stocks. Do you see why it can justify both? You can say, that's why I pick stocks, because I am good at finding those top 10. of the gain in market cap, the 7,500 companies in the market. The lesson I think you take out of this is those winners are what's driving the portfolio. Now, for whatever reason, I don't think this has ever happened before. My name came up in the Berkshire Hathaway and I got like a thousand text messages. It came up in a good way and a bad way. Some guy got up and he asked a question about% plus of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio it did much better than the other stocks so the question is become a large person in the portfolio, they've got to be outperforming everything else. But it's a debate worth having about what to do with the winners in your portfolio. Finally, stocks that were undervalued on both a DCF and a pricing basis did better than stocks that were just undervalued on one basis. I know often people make you choose. Are you a believer in intrinsic valuation or do you do pricing? it's not that they're correlated, but remember for you to make money on your valuation, what has to happen? There's got to be a correction. There's got to be a correction, right? So what you're saying is if a stock is both underpriced and undervalued, you've increased the odds of that correction because when something is underpriced, remember for valuation, you're saying nobody else is doing intrinsic valuation. How will they ever know? With pricing now, you have a second force that might cause traders to do a valuation, I didn't ask you to value control. But let's say I'd added that as something to do on the project. You know what you'd have to do then, right? You'd have to take your valuation and say, what if somebody else ran the company? And it releases you to change some of the key inputs about how they fund the company, how much they reinvest, how well they go. So it's almost like you'll have a revenue growth margin and sales to capital ratio with a different person running the company delivering a different value. It could also come from the presence of activist investors. There was a time when activist investors were restricted to the US. Now you see them in Japan. There's a point where activist investors in Japan were essentially not even allowed into annual meetings. Now you see change? And if you decide to go that route, then of course the value of control comes in. So I'm going to talk about four contexts where this expected value of control comes into play. The most obvious one is when you think of a hostile acquisition. What is the word hostile? Have as an undercurrent? What do you say? That you don't like the management of the company more valuable. It could be a company with voting and non-voting shares. So I said this used to be par for the course in Latin America, where you had preferred shares and common shares. But around the world, there are still companies with two classes of shares. We know intuitively which class should trade for a higher price. The voting shares should trade. But the't get to say how the business is run. We'll talk about how to attach a value to that discount. So let's start with a hostile acquisition. I'm going to go back and use Blockbuster as my example because we have two values, right? If you remember, one value was right? In a sense, it's unfair. So if you go value control, first step is how much of that value do I keep for myself? This is not a number you're just going to pay as a premium because otherwise all your hard work comes to nothing. Let's say it'll take you three years to make this change. How would you modify the premium? First, would the premium go down or go up if you have to wait three years? It's going to go down. 13 cents was the status quo value and 1247 was my optimal value. Could you estimate a probability that change will come to the company? You solve for it. Turns out the probability of change coming to the company is 59.5%. But this was after Carl Icahn showed up at the company. Before he showed up, the stock price was only 820. And that attached. So you're saying what happened? count. I guess what you're saying here is over time, that's going to result in a less... Yeah, because in a sense, if I make it more difficult for change to come, investors are not basically going to go back to status quo value. This used to be true in many emerging markets. I mean, we're reinventing history. It's not just the UK. Look at the US, we have two classes of shares. You're essentially moving in the wrong direction. Across the board, we now risk pushing prices down towards status quo value and making change impossible at these Google or Facebook or any of the large companies that have essentially gone public. I think the exceptions are companies like Uber that decided not to have two classes of shares. And I've got to give Uber credit for not doing it. But they were the exceptions rather than the rule. I'll talk about voting and non-voting shares. So to see how this would work. Remember, I said that in Latin America for the longest time, this was the rule, not the exception. that I thought they could change. It came up with 14.7 billion. You got two numbers floating around, right? And here's the game I played. I'm making some implicit assumptions that I'll make explicit in a while. I took the 12 and a half billion and I divided by the total number of shares, voting and non-voting. Essentially, what am I saying? If I get a non-voting share, I'm stuck with the status quo. There's not much I can do. So essentially, your price per share or value per share should be based on the 12 and a half billion. I came up with $17.19. The voting shares traded a premium, but think of what's driving the premium. First is, how well managed or badly managed are companies? Let's pause right there. At well-managed companies, what should happen to the difference between voting and non-voting shares? They should go towards zero. The more badly managed a company, so this might be, if you want to do some research Canadian companies with voting and non-voting shares. These are closely held companies where the owner is three or five shares, but those are the only voting shares. And there are thousands and thousands of outstanding shares. And this comes up in Canadian courts all the time because those voting shares can trade at 50 times the price of the non-voting shares because you're loading up all of that expected value of control into a few shares. So if you run into a company voting and non-voting shares, you can always use to the 2 million. You get 1.02 million. You take a 49% stake in the same firm, you're going to pay 49% of the status quo value. Look at that 2% difference in how much it translates into. Again, the better run a private business, the smaller the minority discount should be. If anybody offers you 49% of the Madison Square Garden, kind of digging into the property change coming, because there are lots of different pieces in play. Which brings me to the final point I want to make about the intrinsic valuation section. When you think about a DCF, lots of moving parts, right? Imagine trying to explain your DCF model to a CEO. After about the second input, he's going to lose, no, he's going to lose patience. He says, look, I don't have the time for this. I have a lot of meetings lined up. Could you give me one metric? First pushback, yeah, it's earnings. I'd like a cashflow. So CFROI fixes the earnings by replacing with cashflows. And second, the second thing you worry about with return capital is there's no time value attached, which is you don't, you wait in earnings, you'll make it the future years and current years equally. CFROI doesn't, it's like an IRR for a company. And Holt Associates is Chicago-based outfit, sold it as the magic bullet, right? If you're a company and you increase your CFROI, your value will it up. It was the fastest growing metric in use in companies. Half the S&P 500 at one point in time in the 1990s adopted it. The sales pitch was, this is amazing. It'll change the way you think about value. In fact, they would use words that would drive me crazy. You'd get a better valuation can prove that if you value a company with EVA, CF, ROI, and DCF, you get exactly the same value. But the point is, it was sold as this magic bullet. All you need to do as a CEO then is to focus on your EVA and everything else will get taken care of. It's a shortcut. You know what the problem with shortcuts is? That you're making a lot of implicit assumptions that people are now going to exploit to game the system. So here's what I want you to do. it's just operating income, right? Can I increase my operating income next year by doing some short-term stuff? That absolutely. EVA encourages, basically, if I judge you based on EVA, I'm encouraging you to go for short-term investments that pay off as higher operating income in the near term over long-term investments that might be better for my company. Does it matter what goes into investment capital? Early on when EVA was computed, people did not capitalize leases What he could say? He was a great salesperson. So I remember being on a panel with him and, you know, he was one of the European CEOs at that time. He was talking about value enhancement. He got up and he held up an annual report for Coca-Cola. He said, Coca-Cola uses EVA. At that time, remember, Coca-Cola was soaring success. Coca-Cola has doubled its market cap. Taking logic classes in school, it needs to be me. So you want to be like Coca-Cola, you should adopt EVA. Remember that Michael Jordan probably had Wheaties that morning as well, according to the ads. I said, I feel like slam dunking the basketball. I'd love to tell you something about my leaping ability. It's like six inches off the ground. The only basketball hoop I can do a slam dunk on are those Fisher Price hoops. I can wear all of the Air Jordans I want, need all the Wheaties I want. I will not slam. So my point is just because Coca-Cola did not become successful because it adopted EVA. second describe the multiple look at the histogram look at the data don't use rules of thumb we have the data in front of us analyze the multiple if an equity multiple go back to a dividend discount model or an equity valuation model do the algebra and you can tell me what variables drive that multiple if it's an enterprise value multiple go back to an enterprise value multiple and do this and only then apply the multiple define describe analyze apply and i said the EV to sales, it's operating margin, return on capital. Essentially, with each one, list out the variance. Those are the variables you want to control for when you look across that multiple. So I asked you to pick a multiple. And here's what you picked. Almost half, I mean, in this class, half of you picked EV. Do you see why you keep climbing to EV to sales? What's the nice thing about pricing things relative to sales? Jackie? There's no negative. fee ratio and price to book ratios. So in terms of equity multiples, nine plus eight, 17% of your companies use equity multiples. And my guess is a few of those are backs. You had no choice but to use an equity multiple because of the bank, there's no such thing as an enterprise value or an enterprise value model. And here's what you found on your pricing relative to your DCF. So I took your DCF value and I took your pricing to see what, and you're probablyvalued by 10% plus. Here, the overvaluation is only about 3%. In fact, I would be surprised if it's not different from zero. You see why with pricing on average, the typical company is going to be fairly priced because by definition, if you're comparing to the rest of the market, you're going to move towards the average. And the breakdown is almost 50-50. Half the companies came out as underpriced, half were Nigeria I don't even know what the second company Academy Sports plus Outers what does it do no I don't know and you can work all the way down you see a few big names GameStop Uber, Zillow Alibaba a lot of younger tech companies part of that so I think it depends on overpriced stocks. I did ask you to try an option pricing model, but what are the two things I said you should look for to see if it works for you? One is it has been money losing. Don't do this in a money making company. Others, there's a lot of debt. This is an option to liquidate. That's why for a growth company, it's kind of pointless even opening this box because the option to liquidate a growth company is going to give you a number much, much lower than a DCF valuation. option where you hope that something good will happen to the casino business and perhaps pay off it just means you can't get the operating assets greater than the outstanding debt right in fact the other class there are at least 15 companies with the dcf value was negative right but ultimately a negative value doesn't make sense because you don't pay a negative price so the value goes below zero you're basically putting up a hand saying i would pay for the equity in the model might kick in. With AMC, what's the optionality? Do people still go to movie theaters? Yeah, right? In fact, you could argue that Disney needs AMC more than AMC needs AMC, right? Because if you take AMC out of the mix, Disney becomes like any other company. They'll go directly to streaming. One of the big things about being a movie company is having that outlet. So maybe one of those companies might step in and say, I'm surprised it hasn't happened already, so what is the final part of your project i wanted you to tell me whether you would buy this is why along the way when people said should i run three regression should i run five my response was do whatever you need to do to make a decision right if you need five regressions to get there run them but this is about converging on that final decision i try to do buy and buy or sell but a lot second you know whether you like it or not when you buy a stock based on evaluation do you believe in market efficiency eventually yes right because how do you make money so we're all believers in market efficiency we just have this very convenient definition of efficient markets that markets putting 5% in it. Yeah, right? In fact, if you're putting all your wealth, you'll almost never pull the trigger, right? It's too much at stake. One reason I put this requirement of no investment I ever make will ever exceed 5% of my portfolio to begin with is it actually makes it more likely that I'll make a decision. Because otherwise I have too much riding on the decision. I'm going to on one hand, the other hand, or the third. I'm buying sitting. Do I feel sure that I make money? Of course, what does the word moderate in front mean? So I would take out the moderate and pick one or the other. Don't do this buy-hold. You can't do both at the same time, right? But this reflects the fact that this is why analysts can do stuff like this and get away with it, right? It's not their money. It's a strong buy, weak buy, moderate buy. Take the moderate, strong, weak. You either buy or you sell. to sell ratio. So when that number is above one, there are more buys than sells. So let's start in spring of 1999. It was close to one, which means there were as many buys as sells. Spring of 2001, it had shot up to what I think the highest number ever. There were one and a half times more buys than sells. So what happened in spring of 2000, spring of 2001? The dot-com boom bust. In a sense, all of a sudden, you know, first, what do you value? No, depends on the asset value, how marketable it is, whether it has a capacity to generate cash flows. For God's sakes, don't waste your time valuing Bitcoin or valuing a Picasso. There's no such thing. You can price it, right? How do you price a Picasso? You look at other Picassos, a Picasso, light paintings, you see what other people pay for them and you adjust the price. probably should be doing more pricing than valuation. Time is not your ally. If I asked you, do you have a long-term... I'll wager if I go around the room, you'd all claim to have a long-term rise. Why? Because that's what we're supposed to say, right? But this is really not your choice. Some of it you were born with. Some of us are naturally more impatient than others. Some of it is thrust upon you. You're, you know, wondering... buy the company and hold it for its cash flows. They're doing it because you want to beat the market over the next year. And finally, it'll depend on what you think about markets. How do markets make mistakes? They make mistakes that they correct over time, which is what intrinsic valuation is built on. But they make mistakes in the cross-section. They're right on average, but they're wrong on individual, which is what pricing is driven by. So if you ask me, which is better, valuation or pricing? I'm going to turn it back on you. Messier and more complex than you thought it was. And this isn't for you. It's a very healthy recognition when that happens. Because you know what it's going to lead to, right? You're going to put your money in index funds, going back to live the rest of your life. You live perfectly fulfilling life. So you never value another company. I know I'm not supposed to say that in evaluation class. Millions, billions of people over time have lived fulfilling lives without ever having valued a company. So you can be able to develop that. Trust in numbers is too strong a word, but acceptance of numbers is something you have to talk about in business. And if you're a number cruncher, and I said this was the tougher task, I hope you feel enough confidence in changed, that the old rules don't apply. And the more I see things change, and the more I see them change back, the more I'm convinced that it goes back to basics. I mean, when you talk about business, it's revenues, cash flows, growth. I mean, those things don't change just because you're in a new economy and a new kind of company. So go back to basics. And if nothing else, I hope that's second. I mean, in the evaluation, that sales to capital that you took hours and hours thinking about, if you did 3% growth rate, you know what? The sales to capital ratio is making almost no effect on your value. Why? Because your revenues are growing so little. If your revenues are growing 30%, it makes far more sense of what's the right sales to capital for your company. The reason I did not kind of make it explicit is sometimes you've got to work with numbers to the point where you say, that's the number in this company that I should be focusing on. kind of evidence here. And people still use it, right? They use the example of an individual company when in fact, we have the data to counter. We have hundreds of companies. Let's let the data guide us. Keep your perspective. It's only evaluation from about 15 years ago. Now, end of one of my classes, somebody who's graduating comes up to me. She was a history major from Yale. he's scared and I said what are you so scared about she says what if I make a mistake I said be glad you're not a brain surgeon brain surgeon makes a mistake somebody dies on the table right you're an equity research analyst you make a mistake what happens somebody gets richer somebody else gets a little poorer just make sure that somebody's getting a little poorer is not you that's the only requirement think like a Marxist you move some wealth around the world has intended the peak of the dot-com boom. And all she would talk about was what was in her portfolio, what was out of her portfolio, what she wished was inward. And she thought I was interested, but I had to act interested. That's what son-in-laws do. And then she lets it slip that she owned Cisco, one of the great stocks of the 90s. I was impressed. I said, Judy, why did you pick Cisco? I was afraid the answer that I wrote now, but there is a CFE you're supposed to fill it out. You know why I'm reminding you of doing it? Because if you don't fill And the time, I think, is 1.30 to 3.30. So around the time of the class. What? I don't want to take it for the soonest. So, I'm not excited.
