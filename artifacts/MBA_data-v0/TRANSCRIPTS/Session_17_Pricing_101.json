{"text": " Diolch yn fawr iawn am wylio'r fideo. session captain two more packets to get through Okay, folks, let's get started. I hope you had a chance to pick up your quiz. If not, it's still up there. So try to pick it up as soon as you can. So you can at least check the grading, make sure I haven't missed up. So today we're going to change gears. We're going to actually talk about pricing things rather than value. So as a lead in, let's start with a question. And in fact, I'm going to do any of that stuff technically the answer is that's true right but one of the things we're going to talk about in the context of pricing is is that really true are you not making assumptions or is the truth a little more difficult to going to argue that the skill set you need to deal with pricing is actually statistics. Because what's statistics designed to do? What's the object of the discipline? What are we trying to do in statistics? Trying to make sense of large and contradictory data. Both pieces have to be, if it's just five observations, you don't need statistics. You can take whichever market you want. And I drew a histogram. Remember histograms and statistics? You count the number of companies, p-ratio, 0 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 12. And I put up a distribution. Will that distribution ever look like that distribution we so love in statistics classes? The normal distribution. In fact, let's step back. What is it that's so nice about the normal distribution statistics? Why, when you see a normal distribution, to the tails. Minus infinity to plus infinity, right? The tails get really thin at the end. What's the lowest number of P-E ratio you can take? Have you ever seen a negative P-E ratio? No, you don't. You know why? Because when the earnings turn negative, the P-E ratio becomes not meaningful. So the lowest value P-E ratio can have is zero. What's the highest value a P-E ratio can take? They're called asymmetric distributions. And he warned us, never trust the average when you have an asymmetric distribution. Why not? There's going to be a skew, right? Basically, all your outliers are big positive numbers. There's no big negative numbers to offset. The average is going to give you a number that's at a p-ratio software company trading at a p-ratio of 12 the average for the sector or the median for the sector is 20 let's suppose we're not playing the average yet the median for the sector is 20 and you're trying to make a judgment so based on those numbers what's the usual judgment it's it PE ratio, but staying with it. How risky are you as a company? So even if you don't want to talk about cost of equities, and odds are that many companies that trade at low PE ratios are there because they're much riskier companies. So questions you need to get answered before you decide something is cheap. And that's basically what we're going to do with every multiple is come up with a list of here are the questions you need to ask, whether it's PE or price to book or EV to EBITDA or EV to sales. Because if you can ask those questions, you can do pricing well. I don't have a problem with pricing, but I have a problem with sloppy pricing. So let's think about the drivers of pricing. model might be the vehicle you use to deliver those assumptions, but it's cash flows, growth, and risk. What drives price? It's demand and supply. You think, are demand and supply driven by cash flows, growth, and risk? Yes, but they're also driven by mood and momentum. In fact, for the last 50 years in finance, behavioral finance has developed as an area to explain why people might price things that should not be in the value. And you might come to that conclusion after you valued a couple of companies and you might say, I'm making these assumptions. I have no idea what I'm doing. And you know what? That's a healthy conclusion. Because how much money it's going to save you and how much time it's going to save you to buy index funds and you go back to living the rest of your life. It's always value pricing process. So they don't waste any time and pricing. They think it's a waste of time. And finally, there are pricing experts. What are those? They're the ones that say, what is this intrinsic value talk about? There's no such thing. It's in your head. My favorite show on CNBC to be on is Fast Money. It's a show that happens after the market closes. It's actually where they get four traders on the, what I'd like to at least set up as the process is to think about what each of these groups has its dilemma. The efficient market group is the only one that has no dilemmas. They're secure, and Gene Farmer sleeps well at night saying, you know what? Markets are almost always right. Why am I wasting my time? But let's say you're in the value gap, which presumably because you're taking this class, you'd believe there's at least about value, the price has to. Are you uncertain about whether or when that will happen? You should be. Why? Because you don't control the market. Do you see the two uncertainties bubbling up to the surface? You're uncertain about your value. You're uncertain about price adjusting value, which is one reason I diversify. Because I know I'm going to screw up in individual companies. Hopefully, I don't screw up in all 50, which is, I've done my job, I've done all the homework, I value the company, the price is what it is, and it'll adjust, will not adjust, it's not in my control. The karmic view says, I don't control that, so worrying about it is not going to make it happen. 1,000 billion, right? Because in terms of numbers, there's nothing really, but there seems to be some magic we attach to the market crossing 40,000, 35,000. And from an intrinsic value standpoint, people say, who really cares? But I think we should. And here's what, when a company hits these arbitrary targets, more attention is played to the company, right? Because it hits. And one of the arguments you can make is the board of directors. They have an activism score. It's a whole host of numbers you might use to decide where that correction is most likely. So I'll give away where I come from. I believe in value, but I also know I'm going to be wrong in value, and I don't control the pricing process. So if you get a chance, if you go back, I've been valuing Apple every year since 2009. looks overvalued today could very well become undervalued, especially if it's the kind of company that's overvalued by 60%. It's overvalued by 60%. When it gets undervalued, it doesn't stop at being 5% undervalued. It'll shoot in the other direction. So what makes it overvalued by large percentages is also going to make it undervalued. Now, if you think about what we're trying to do here, it's to get to the comfort point where you're actually willing to put real the story of the Wizard of Oz? I'll tell you the story. And as I tell you, don't jump on me because I don't make up these stories. It's about a girl called Dorothy who lives in Kansas. And a tornado sucks her up and drops her into this mythical land called Oz. You're saying this is so unrealistic. I'm not telling the story. This is the actual story of the Wizard of Oz. She lands on a witch. I don't know. I always get the mixed up witch of the East, the witch of the road. And for three and a half hours, this is what she does. She hops and she skips and she never walks. If you don't believe me, watch the movie. She's always hopping and skipping down. And along the way, she collects a motley crew. A lion, which is cowardly, a scarecrow. They all want something and they're all told, go see the Wizard of Oz. He has the answer to every question you might have. Three and a half hours later, it's a really long movie. evaluation. If you watch the movie, it turns out that each of them got what they were looking for on the journey. Dorothy found these red shoes, and all she has to do is click the shoes. She's back in Kansas. The cowardly lion fought off some bad guys, and along the way, she already had courage. Essentially, they learned everything, or they got what they wanted on the journey. You still don't see what's got to do with evaluation, right? on the journey. You learn valuation by doing. You learn valuation by getting stuck and unsticking yourself by reasoning your way to an answer. I wrote a piece for a teaching journal saying, the curse of Google search. You know why, right? Because when you have a question, what's your first inclination? Let me go look it up on Google search. Somebody's intrinsic valuation, the answer often lies by going back and asking, what is the question I'm trying to address? So that's the last you'll hear from about intrinsic valuation, at least for the moment. So let me start on packet two, because. My youngest son lives and works in New York. So we were going to go to opening day, Yankee Stadium. But he had to work. His employer, for whatever reason, insisted he work between 1 and 4 in the afternoon. He said he couldn't make it. So we said Sunday, we'll do it. So two days later. And now he still keeps college student hours, which means he goes to bed God only knows when. is I went on SeatGeek. Now you're buying a ticket. You're saying, how much should I pay? SeatGeek makes life really simple. Have you ever used the site? SeatGeek is an aggregator site with sites like StubHub and other sites where you can buy tickets. The nice thing about SeatGeek is not only does it aggregate, it does your homework for you. So I wanted something at field level because it would be fun. So I got a field level seat. And I picked Se to find out. But the essence of pricing is what do you do? You look at, first you identify comparable assets. In this case, seats in the same price there usually means dividing the price by something, price by earnings, price by workers, a multiple. And controlling for differences would be why do some companies have higher P-E ratios than others, growth and risk and cash flows, all the things you were running away from in intrinsic valuation. So I'm going to start with a statement about pricing that I think I can back up. When I say that almost everything that passes for valuation out there is pricing, here's where I make that statement. plus 45 is 495. What about the other 55? I was completely mystified is what they were doing. Maybe they were using tarot cards and doing something, but I have no idea. But among the ones I could classify, 10 to 1, pricing outnumbers. If you don't believe me, walk into a Goldman Sachs or a Morgan Stanley, but they have all the equity research reports lined up. Pick up each one and read it. You're going to see roughly the same statistic. that they weren't DCFs, they were actually pricing in drag. Why? What's the biggest number in a DCF? The terminal value. And how does the terminal value estimated using a multiple of EBITDA or revenues? So even in M&A, it seems like pricing dominates. And almost every investing rule is based in some kind of a multiple, right? A PE ratio less than 10 is cheaper. Price to book less than one is cheaper. PEG ratio less than one. Everything is stated in terms of pricing metrics, with both valuing your company and pricing your company. I know it might be a sample size of one. You've only done it with one company. If you had to pick right now, which one you trust more, which one you will base your decisions on, seven to two, people pick pricing over, I'm sorry, valuation over pricing. Reflecting my biases, I guess, you know, you're reflecting. So when you leave my room and when you start working that makes you go from being believers true believers in intrinsic valuation to everyday users of pricing so let so i started what might be the reason the first one came revenues your cholesterol is 350 not a problem relative people who died of heart attacks in the last four before two years you look okay all i have to do is pick the right comparables and i can pretty much tell spin you any story or what we forget how 12 times EBITDA, because that's what the sector is pricing companies at. Think of how small the target is. You don't like 12 times EBITDA, take it up with the market. In effect, in pricing, that's basically what I'm saying. It's not my fault. I am just the messenger here. significantly better than the market. But I'm going to be wrong about 43% of the time. With pricing, I think if I'm lucky, I might be right 51% of the time, even if I bring all the data and statistics. 57 beats 51, right? I'm right more often at the intrinsic valuation. But here's the catch. When I'm wrong on intrinsic valuation, I'm far more likely to be wrong alone. You see why? dot-com analyst in the late 90s, stayed on as equity research analyst in the next decade, right? In any just world, Barry Meeker should never, ever be allowed into equity research ever again. But if you're doing pricing, your argument is everybody was doing it. When I first started teaching this class, I used to try to talk people out of pricing. I don't do that anymore because the reality is most of you People are doing what they're doing. I might not agree with them. It might give me a basis for at least coming up with a way of saying, this is when I should buy a company when it's undervalued. Understanding why markets do things can be critical in how you value companies or when you act on those valuations. And if you're in a job where you're going to get judged against other people doing the same job, whether you like it or not, you've got to be working on parallel paths. When you look at a multiple and you look at the numerator, the numerator will almost always, in fact, let me take the almost, will always have a market number in it. That market number can just be the market value of equity, market cap. It can be market value of equity plus market value of debt, which is total value of the firm. Or it can be market value of equity plus market value of debt minus cash, which is called enterprise value. They're all numbers which are market set. You're getting desperate, but you need a positive number in the denominator. If nothing else works, you say, I'll divide by the number of cars in the parking lot. You need a pricing metric scale to something. So it could be revenues, could be drivers of revenues. It could be earnings, right? The earnings can be to equity investors, which is net income, or it could be to all investors, which is operating income. It can be to cash flows. accountants think your company is worth. What does that mean? You can divide them by book value of equity, because that's what the accountant says your equity is worth, by invested capital, which is book value of equity plus book value of debt minus cash, or even book value of equity plus book value of debt, which you can think of as the book value of the firm. Revenues, earnings, cash flows, and book value. So when you look at multiples, first thing to do is, what are they doing? What's in the numerator? What's in the denominator? Get that kind of nailed down. rules on multiples on that they be consistently defined i'll come back and explain what i mean by that and uniformly estimated which is actually easier to understand because you're going to compare 15 companies you got to be estimating the same way for all 15 companies you start with the definitional test second step i'm going to describe the multiple sounds fancy right but i'm going to play money ball you've seen the movie i'd strongly recommend my favorite movies of all time had long histories, but none of them worked. So a scout would say, this guy has a crooked arm. People with crooked arms are very good pitchers. Trust me, I know this. And after you paid $15 million to get this guy with a crooked arm, it turned out that he had some malfunction in his elbow, and his elbow blew up. So finally, he said, why are we trusting these guys? They have no idea what they're talking about. And baseball is a sport, more than any other sport, fan when he was playing for the Red Sox. The God of walks is what he was called because he found a way to actually, he had a very good eye and he managed to walk, you know, 30% of the time. What I'm going to do is the equivalent of what you saw in the movie. We've been listening to scouts tell us rules of thumb and investing all this time, but we have this incredible amount of data in front of us. What if we used to play some money ball? And luckily we don't need Jonah Hill to do this. We have the data, we have the statistics, compare across companies. Define, describe, analyze. And only then am I going to apply. You know, the problem with pricing is people are in such a hurry to apply a multiple, they don't want to go through the first three steps. So let's start with the first question. Look at a multiple. First question I ask is're supposed to be getting with enterprise value. In the denominator, you have a measure of operating cash flow, a very rough pre-tax, pre-CAPEX measure. EV to EBITDA is okay as well. What about price to EBITDA? It's a horrific multiple. The analysts invented this. shows. I said, what the heck are you doing? Dividing price by EBITDA? It's not consistent. He said, no, no, I'm being consistent. So what do you mean you're being consistent? He said, I use price to EBITDA for all 15 companies in my sector. I said, it's a very strange definition of consistency. I said, have you been noticing that companies with a lot of debt in your sector keep looking cheap to you? He said, yeah, yeah. I said, have you ever stopped and wondered why technology and why do you get away with it because it did not have that you got lucky the other is retail and even there it's shaky now it used to work because everybody had roughly they all had lease commitments they all had debt mismatch is a recipe for disaster so that's the first stop is make sure your multiple is consistently defined years ago, S&P actually created a database where they take reported earnings and actually clean up for items that they felt were being miscategorized to try to come up with consistent earnings. They gave up on it. The demand was just not there. But there's this company called New Construct. If you get a chance, they're online. They actually try to do this with companies. It's clean up earnings, so we get a number that, I don't know. But I remember turning the TV off saying, is that all it is? Does Anna Konnikova really know what the P rate is? She kept going. She said something about preferred dividends. It went completely over my head. called trailing PE. It can be earnings per share from the next four quarters, which would be forward PE, or it'd be earnings per share from the year 2030, which is really, really forward PE. So why would I do that? Desperation again. You're the biotech analyst. You've got 35 companies in your sector. 33 are losing money. And PE ratio is the only tool you know how to use. Guess what you do? You project out the earnings for every company. And you say, this company is cheap. It's trading at eight times 2030 earnings. So what am I supposed to use? Depends on what I'm trying to do. If I'm trying to sell you Cisco, guess which number I latch onto. Cisco is cheap. It trades at 14 times earnings. If I want to show you Cisco is expensive, the next time you see it, this is one of the funniest things to see on CNBC, is two analysts with differing views of a stock, both using price-earnings ratios, but they can't even agree a share count. And then you have a partially diluted share count where you count only options if they're in the money, or a fully diluted share count where you count in all options. Your earnings per share obviously got to be different with each definition. So let's say you're looking at a sector where there's big variations in how much stock-based compensation gets used by different companies. And let's say they use options. Are any of those three approaches, or primary earnings per share, this stock is going to look cheap because I'm not factoring in the reality that there are 100 million options overhanging. So with primary earnings per share, I'm going to bias myself against companies which have very few options and towards companies. If I use diluted, fully diluted earnings, I'm going to go in the other direction. I'm counting all these options. I'm in the money, some out of the money. I'm counting as if they're all shares. equity value, right? Can we estimate what that equity value is? You did it for quiz too. What did you do? Attach an option pricing model. It'll never happen. Trust me, this will never happen. It's too much work. No analysis is ever going to do it. But if you truly wanted something that was comparable across companies, we should be using not the market cap, but the market cap plus the value of the equity options outstanding and including all the restricted stock, because that is the true value of equity. which we get away with until we run into a problem with distressed companies, but in theory, it should be market value debt minus cash, right? We use net debt. So I've asked this question of hundreds of analysts who use EV debit. I seldom get the right answer. Maybe you can give me what the answer is. Why do we net cash out of the numerator? I think cash already has a value and there's your answer right because my denominator does not include the income from cash i have to take it out of the numerator and i've opened a pandora's book in addition to netting out cash what else do i need to be net out out of the numerator what what other assets do companies own whose income doesn't show up as part of epita or cross holdings and other companies half-assed is minority interest is book value, right? So they're taking a book value of minority interest and adding it to cash. So basically their reasoning is good, but you can already see that getting consistency with EBITDA means dealing with cross-soldings. So if you are running away from intrinsic valuation because that cross-solding section freaked you out, guess what? It's chasing you down when you're doing pricing. It's always going to be something you deal with. up with the ratio for housing. What is the equivalent multiple I'd look at in the equity market to decide whether equity was cheaper or more expensive? So you're trying to be consistent. So I'm taking the housing price and dividing by rental income. First, housing price, is it closer to market cap or is it closer to enterprise value? Did you pay for the entire house? Usually not, you have to think about, am I comparing apples to apples? Because otherwise I can come up with the wrong conclusions about an asset class. So I'd let you think about it. If I have housing price to rental income, you know, rental income would be what I make if I rented this house out. What is the analogy I would use in the equity market to make a comparison as to whether equities are cheaper than housing? When you do pricing, having access to a database like S&P Capital IQ becomes immensely useful. I can now pull up the P ratios for not just every company in your sector in this market, but across the globe. I can pull back P ratios for the last 20 years for every company. The data is there. But when you look at data, you can't just look at 60 companies over 20 years. You've got to compress the data, summarize the data. So start with the standard summary statistic. actually use capital IQs, P ratios, price to book, EBITDA, EBITDA sets. You know why? Not because they're necessarily wrong, but I don't know what they're doing with cross-ordings. I don't know what they're doing with Goodwill. I don't know what they're including in earnings per share. So I want to make sure that I control the numerator and the denominator. And my advice to you is when you're going to compute multiples, do it yourself. This is one number divided by another number. Why do you have to have capital IQ do it for you? It doesn't save you any time. above 100 but if I kept going it would keep going. And to show you how this plays out in terms of statistics, here's what the numbers look like when I computed the summary statistics. First let me start at the top line. There were 7165 companies in my SEP, that's every publicly traded company in the US, but I seem to have lost about 4,000 companies in just computing PE ratio. When you see an average computed across PE ratios, deals with the average across the companies that actually survive and have earnings. That might not be the PE ratio you want to report for the sector because there are all these other companies. I've struggled with this for the last 30 years because I compute averages by sector. And when I first started doing this, I used to compute the average across the companies that had PE ratios. And I very quickly realized that I was getting numbers that didn't capture. So if I took bi see how that would solve the problem in terms of bringing the... Because basically I want to get the information that 32 companies that I threw out to not leave the data because there is information there. I'll tell you what I do. I add up the market cap of every company in the sector. they're actually more like very high PE ratios. So the problem with PE ratios is because that continuum gets broken, you have to throw out negative earnings companies. But if you use earnings to price ratios, nothing stops you from having a negative earnings to price ratio. That's worse than having a positive earnings to price ratio. And essentially you get a continuum that works. So one reason for using earnings yields instead of PE ratios is you no longer have to throw away But before it freaks you out, the median PE at the start of 2023 was 13.92. What does that mean? Half of all companies with PE ratios trade at less than 13.92. You see, that's a huge difference in the average and the median. And the culprit is right here. There's actually one company with a PE ratio of 0.05. You know what probably happened to it, right? The earnings reflects a trailing 12-month earnings, and There's this moment of grace at the start of the year, probably March, April, when current and trailing PE converge. And then they will diverge again. So trailing PE, I have about 3,097, almost the same as current PE. But then when I go to forward PE, I lose another 600 companies. Why? When you talk about description, that's basically what you're looking for is what can I learn from the data? So from until about 2004, I used to do this just for U.S. companies, not because I was parochial, but because the raw data I had actually came from ValueLine. I didn't have, there's no capital IQ. And I did just U000 publicly traded companies. And I create this chart simply, again, to get perspective. So basically, in this, I have a chart for three groups of companies, US companies, emerging market companies, global companies. So if you look at those three charts, which I'm sorry to do, they all look peak to the left, tail to the right, right? Doesn't mean everybody has the same P ratios. So break down P ratios by region. And I want you to look at those P ratios and tell me whether there's things you can learn about. and after really good years, Canadian stocks have really low PE ratios because the market prices these companies on cycles. In fact, if you look at price-to-book ratios, you see the same kind of phenomenon. Look at the median. The markets that have the lowest price-to-book or the regions that have the lowest price-to-book ratios are mostly Latin America. They're mostly emerging markets, Africa, Eastern Europe. reasons why it looks cheap. And finally, one reason I like to have these distributions play money ball is I get sick and tired of rules of thumb. Six times EBITDA is cheap. You know how many times I've been told that when I'm in a panel? I now refuse to be on panels. It's mind-numbing to be on a panel sometimes. The PE guys say, what is this DCF stuff you do? We know how to find the cheap stock at six times EBITDA. at less than six times EBITDA. How can it be cheap if half of all companies do it? Could six times EBITDA be cheap in 2023 unless you happen to be in Japan? Do you see where I'm going? Having these absolute rules of thumb is kind of absurd because the numbers change underneath year to year. They change across markets. So if you wanted to create a rule of thumb that was actually data-centric rather than pick six times EBITDA, if you want to stay with the data how we still hang on with rules of thumb that have lost their entire basis because let's become conventional wisdom peg ratio less than one is cheap no that's again widely used practice i actually and i'll show you the graph of peg ratios very quickly because that doesn't look cheap to me so define describe next session when we start i'm going to give you a very simple", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 150.31], "text": " Diolch yn fawr iawn am wylio'r fideo. session captain two more packets to get through Okay, folks, let's get started.
