  "text": " you There should be a price per share, which is the current market price somewhere in there, right? It's like four pages per company. And if you're wondering how the heck do I summarize a discounted cashflow valuation and get it all done within that page limit, here's what won't work. If you try to describe to me how you computed a bottom-up levered beta, you're dead in the water, right? Because I got the unlevered beta, then I went and looked at these companies. I know how you got the bottom-up beta. So I'm going to write it out. Just take the, you know, take a picture. Don't just, you know, with my eyes, just don't make it really small. No, it has to be readable. I don't have a magnifying glass and I don't want to be using that. So, you know, if need be, keep it as a full page so that you can fit this in rather than compress it into a quarter page. We've done this big deal about value versus price, right? The question I'm asking as a CEO is, do you want to increase prices or do you want to increase value? What do you think CEOs really want to increase? Pricing. And that creates a whole lot of contradictions because I'm going to give you a series of actions and I'd like you to tell me whether they affect value and then hazard a guess as could they affect prices. What if I do a stock split? What does it do to your intrinsic valuation? the 10 for one stock split, buying 100 shares at $2,000 per share is out of the reach for most people. So maybe it's liquidity, maybe it's new demand. It could affect prices. And in fact, studies show on average that when you have a stock split, there's an increase in price, 3 to 3%, and it's a signaling effect. What about amortizing goodwill? It's a big deal, right? You hire these accounting firms to come in on an acquisition reaction is. If you have a $7 billion loss and people say, oh, my God, that's a huge loss and knocked down the price. But markets actually seem to be pretty clever on impairment of goodwill. You know, the average price impact on goodwill impairment is zero. Because by the time people do it, I knew that already that happened three years ago. So you must be wondering why we spend so much time impairing goodwill and doing all the accounting thing. know what your reporting books look like. But if I'm reacting as a trader to earnings per share numbers, I might very well push up your stock pricing. This is amazing. This is not as common with late 90s. A lot of companies issued what were called tracking stock. I think the New York Times actually had a tracking stock, you know, in which division? The dot-com division. What about changing your name as a company? Shouldn't affect value, right? Cash flows, growth, and risk, as we'll see when you change names, sometimes there's a pricing effect. So what I'm trying to say is when people talk about, I want to enhance value, my first question to them is, do you really want to enhance value? Because that's usually hard work and you've got to change businesses and do things in your business, or do you want to enhance prices? capital first business and 20% cost. So you can see which one's the loser division, right? It kind of stands out. It's division. You now become the CEO. And you know, the first imperative when you become a CEO is you want to clear the ship. You want to divest yourself. Which business would you divest as the new CEO? I told you, cut, Jackie. That's what the most common answer you'd get. Let's get to Tata Motors. They just wanted to get it off the books. And then they heaved a sigh of relief. 15 years later, Jaguar Land Rover is the engine that drives Tata Motors. It's what drives the value of the company. Often selling your worst businesses is, in business. It's earning well above the cost of capital, right? It's also the business most likely to be the business where people will overpay for. Divestitures, just like acquisitions, it all depends on the price. Getting rid of bad businesses does not make you a better company in terms of creating value because you're not going to get your money back. It's too late. you as a shareholder in Google be better off or worse off after the buyback and what will it depend on? First is it depends on whether you trust Google, right? They're not going to let you look at the projects. You're saying, do I trust Google? 10 years ago, the answer would be absolutely. Today? Kind of shaky, right? Because every project that Google has taken after that search box, I mean, the rest of the alphabet is like the seven dwarfs, right? few months, you actually did see a buyback. That would be the sensible thing to do because Microsoft did exactly the same thing in 2004. When people started to lose trust, they actually did a buyback saying, look, you don't trust us. Here's your cashback, which is the sensible thing for companies to do. So as you watch the FANGAM stocks, don't be surprised, especially among the ones that lag, that you start to see buybacks as a this case, I pull up not every company in the sector, but what I call transaction multiples, basically only companies that have done acquisitions. So I want you to file that away. So there are 25 companies, but I picked the seven acquisitions in the sector. So five times that is pricing argument. I said, it's okay to make a pricing argument, but I think there's a problem even on a pricing basis with this argument. I want you to think about it. What goes in this argument? My comparables and my multiple, right? It's always an issue in pricing, but the way I've constructed my comparables and the way I pick a multiple, I'm going to argue are much more problematic when you do acquisition pricing than in traditional pricing. So let that fall away. and why it's not a meaningful measure of success. So when you think about pricing, let's start with the pricing question. And statistics, we sample all the time, right? When you do the peer group for your company, you sampled. You made choices about what geographies, what market gaps, and sampling. You have to do it. Otherwise, our universe is too big. Is this a sample? Yeah, the sample. is people who watch the entire coronation on TV. And then you ask them, what do you think about the royalty? What do you think the answer is going to be? We love the royalty, 97%. Why? Because the only people who watch the coronation all the way through are people who are 75 years old who love the royalty. It's a sampling bias. If you pick a sample of companies. So is everybody clear on the bias coming in when you use transaction multiples and why you need to expand the sample to look at companies that were not in transactions because otherwise you create bias in the process? But that's really not an acquisition, right? You price buildings based on, it's a forward pricing, right? It's always been meaningless. And here's why. Let's think in terms of P ratios, right? You're a company with a P ratio of 10. What kind of company would you have to buy in terms of P ratios for your acquisition to be accretive? Companies with lower P ratios than yours or higher P ratios? Lower. Lower P ratios because if you're a company that buys higher P ratios, you're essentially going to do only dilutive. Don't go to the other extreme, but it shows you that how creative tells you very little about the deal. You know, the logic though, that allows a creative deals to look good, right? The logic is I traded 20 times earnings. So I'm now at my wit's end. I've tried everything I can. So I hit you with my trump card. I said, no, you're being very, very difficult as a negotiator. So I have to tell you, just between you and me, your CEO really wants this deal to go through. So you might come in and say intrinsic value of 60 million, the one. I mean, we know that premiums paid on acquisitions are affected by CEOs. You know, of all the things in behavioral finance that we've isolated that are dangerous in investing in corporate finance, the most dangerous is overconfidence. Of all the things that get investors and companies in trouble, it's overconfidence. And it doesn't surprise me, overconfident CEOs often carry this acquisition gene no matter where they go. So if you have an overconfident CEO, you're in a sense, throwing good money after that. Final piece is the piece about a counter-verting. HP can be almost a poster child for a company that overpays, the company that every five years would have a corporate governance problem, then they have an overpayment problem, and then they take a write-off of $8.5 to $10 billion. software services company. And they paid $11.1 billion for the company. It's a company that was trading at about $5.9 billion before. So they paid a premium of $5.2 billion. So essentially, I tried to build up to that number. And essentially, this is a very mechanical way of building up to it. The book value, pre-deal book value of equity of autonomy was about $2.1 billion. They bought an accountant who adjusted the value. Remember's talking about the acquisition. He said, we have a pretty rigorous process inside HP that we follow for all acquisitions, which is a D.C.F. base model. We leave it at that. Right. We know there are good DCFs and bad DCFs. So the very fact that he did a D.C.F. base model tells you he knows nothing about DCF. Right. And he referring, of course, this is journalist talking, referring to discounted cash flow valuation is standard. year. One year later. This happened in record time. The deal unraveled. HP blamed it on accounting problems at autonomy. They said that's the only reason the deal came apart. So when the deal came apart, I decided I wanted to assign blame because they actually wrote down the $11.1 billion to $2.3 billion. That's an $8.8 billion back from them. And if you look at the remaining write-off, this has to be HP actually running the company worse than it was run before. So lots of blame around here, right? You know how many people actually got held responsible for this? Do you think Deloitte returned the accounting fees? No. Do you think the banker said this is a bad deal? Sorry about doing this. We shouldn't have done the projections. No. Leo Portico was retired as a CEO, I want to at least create some value here. So I'm going to give you some choices about where you can create value from acquisitions. And some of the choices are pretty easy. So you can tell me which one you would pick. So your objective is to create value from acquisitions. Would you prefer to be a sole bidder or be in a bidding war? It's an easy one, sole bidder. Would you like a public target or a big target? Mergers of equals or mergers of unequals? Much better chance with a small target, right? Because if you make a mistake, then it's not going to kill you. At least you have a chance of fixing it. And finally, would you prefer to go for cost synergies or growth synergies? Cost synergies, this is basically the two bidders for the company. And what happens is stock prices around the time a target is actually pegged. So being the winner in a bidding war is like, but we know this from economics. This is this idea called the winner's curse. Have you heard of this? doing a small deal or a big deal. So the way to read this is there's cash, there's stock combo, and this is based on the size of the deal. It's less than 6% of the acquiring company, 6 to 10%. So the larger the number, the bigger the target is relative to you as a company. On really small deals, so the blue part is the really small deals, you can see that using stock is much more value creating than just the size effect itself is dominating, but that's possible. It might not be just the share effect, the fact that almost every big deal creates a size effect. And focusing on private companies is a clear winner over public companies. So basically the way to read this is again, small to large deals in every single segment, the McKinsey study that looked at the percentage of the time that synergies get delivered. So to your right, you see cost synergies. Out of the, I think, 92 cases, 36 plus, 61 of the cases, you delivered 100% or more of the synergies. In contrast, if you look at growth synergies, about a third of the time you've got to do bigger acquisitions or more acquisitions just to get the same growth rate. So if you're going to do acquisition-based strategies, I would say do it, but every year you've got to say, scale up organic growth than it is to scale up acquisition-driven growth, just because of magnitude of the companies. Any questions on acquisitions? And if you really want this process to work, make sure you plan for acquisitions before you do them. Hold somebody accountable for delivering on those numbers. The banker doesn't care, right? He's going to give the projections or she's going to give the projections, get the deal done, and they the rest of the deals, you don't have to buy the remaining shares, right? So when you think about bidding wars, losing basically means you stop paying that outrageous price because you're no longer part of the bidding war. But I have to buy the remaining shares at the price that I want it. And if I'm paying too much, guess how it's going to show up? It's going to show up as a much lower stock price because I'm overpaying. Because you don't have to pay any more money, right? So let's say youants can write up the value of existing assets. So even if they do it right, they're not going to get to the market value. The extent that the market and assessment of expected growth, that extra $1.3 billion was what the market was attaching over and above the accountant's estimate of fair value. So think of accountants writing up all your existing assets to fair value. The market's paying a premium on it. by spending all these resources by marking it up to market. When 80% of you, I mean, let's say I allowed you to do this for Zoom or Snowflake, right? Your fair value is going to give me no indication of what the company is actually worth. So let's talk about value enhancement. I told you value enhancement and price enhancement are not necessarily the same thing. I'm going to show you the results of two studies from a long time ago, Would add.com to the names. What's a.com doing? No, it's just.com. But you could see why they did it. Because when this study looked at what happened to stock prices when you put.com in there, the stock prices jumped. These are small companies. They jumped 100%, 150% because you now called yourself usdeal.com. You don't even know what that means, but you go to.com. You think that's absurd. But it also means that this entire class might have been a waste of time, right? took dot-com out of their names because by now dot-com was a contaminant people didn't want to be you know on dot-com stocks they'd seen the failure rate and there you go stock price goes up again this is an incredible game you put a name in you take a name out you put a name in you take a name out but you can see that this is what pricing price enhancement is about you're playing games looking at what does the market like and i existing assets. So that's my first stop. Can I extract higher cash flows from existing assets? Second stop, I'm going to look at growth. Can I increase my value by changing my policy on growth? And it can be in one of two ways. Either I'm reinvesting too little and I'm a good company debt and equity. But I'm going to argue it's one of four things you might consider to lower your cost of capital. So let's start with the first of those, trying to get more cash flows from existing assets. So I'm going to start with words you often see in many restructurings. There's going to be a lot of cost cutting around here and more efficient operations. Assuming you mean what you say, and the reason I say that a lot of companies can talk the talk, but they never look through it. I don't see it. I don't see it. Because as long as you don't sell it, you're not admitting to a mistake, right? Sometimes shutting a business down is an admission we should never have been in that business. But shutting that business down will almost immediately create a pop for you because you're taking that loss out of the bag. The third is going to sound mildly unpatriotic, contortions if you're a multi if you're a company in multiple countries right because with you know what transfer pricing is there's an entire ecosystem of people who do what's called transfer pricing which is really how do we minimize our taxes by moving things around they'd like to frame themselves as doing more glorious things but that's really what you're doing and how does it work you have a german subsidiary and an irish subsidiary they have interactions with each other and income that cause your taxes to go up. So you can try to increase EBIT. You can try to reduce T. You can see already, it's a very mechanical thing. I'm going item by item. So what can I do? Now, some capex is for growth, right? So just let's say, but some capex is for maintenance, keeping existing assets going. If you can spend less on maintenance capex without affecting the capacity for production, and that's a fine line. companies have to be for this to be the primary place for value enhancement? What kinds of companies? Stable, mature, perhaps even approaching decline. This is where you're going to go, right? This is where the bulk of your value comes from, cost-cutting. Let's talk about the second stop, because now we're going to go beyond that mature phase. Are there some growth companies that are badly managed? Absolutely. There's a very dangerous game, right? Because once you add the 5%, guess what the IRR person does? He finds new ways to create bias to make 14% go to 19%. I don't think it's healthy to play that game, but you're right. People said hurdle rates are too high a number, advice on growth will be invest less. For some of your companies, try this out. Make your sales to capital rate, I mean, make your growth rate and revenue 0% and see what it does to value. Your first reaction is value is going to go down. You might be surprised. And this morning, I had at least two people come into my office with companies, but the higher they made the growth rate, the lower the value became. So what's up in this journal that McKinsey publishes called the McKinsey Quarterly, which you can actually get a free subscription to get on the site, sign up, and you can get the article. So this is actually from a McKinsey Quarterly article where they looked at the dollar value created by A dollar invested creates about 30 to 75 cents in additional value. So you want that number get the higher market share, but what do you have to celebrate? And you can see you are surrounded by markets that are maturing, right? Restaurant business, the smartphone business. And you wonder, how do you grow in a market like this? And at the very bottom of the barrel, you shouldn't be surprised, is acquisitions. By now, you already had the lead and you can see why. of companies earn more than their cost of capital. Some of them have good excuses, right? At a bad year. Some of them are young companies. Some of them blame accounting. But here's where those excuses run dry. Out of that 70%, 40% have had trouble making their cost of capital for years, a decade or more. This is well beyond excuses, right? You're just in a bad business. There are airline companies that have never earned their cost of capital in their lifetime, to my growth period. On a spreadsheet, it's so easy to do, right? What do you do? You take 10 and you make it 20. That was easy. But in real life, to earn more than your cost of capital, you have to have barriers to entry, competitive advantages. I'm trying to find a reason for your corporate strategy class. This is where I have ended up. It's where in my numbers, this is where it shows up, right? You build up competitive advantages, it shows up as a longer growth period. So let's talk about what else you could do. Maybe you can get the government to protect you from competition. That's nice, right? But be careful what you wish for. I mean, remember the old phone companies were protected from competition. Amazing. But why do you want to be a monopoly? What's a great thing? Everybody hates you and your monopoly, right? But how do you get back them? You charge them higher Verizon. I want you to go to the AT&T office and ask, can I switch to AT&T? They will make life so easy for you. Say, well, I'll do it right here. And 15 minutes later, you'll walk out with an AT&T contract. Just don't try to read the contract, which will run 15 pages in really small print. You know what the small print will tell you, right? You're now AT&T. It's going to be really difficult for you to leave. one can be from economies of scale. Walmart's advantage over other retailers for a long time is they did something on things on scale so much larger than every home depot wiped out local hardware stores because it can also be an endowed cost advantage, right? What's Aramco's big competitive advantage that somebody gave them 300. It's not like the CEO of Aramco went and found this oil. Sometimes these cost advantages you're endowed with because you happen to be in your assets, you've created default risk you did not have to, and you perhaps have a higher cost to get. You know what I mean by mismatch? Using short-term debt to fund long-term assets, dollar debt to fund euro assets. It's a fixable problem nowadays with swaps and derivatives. You see the effects of mismatch, right? SVB, classic example of what happens when you mismatch. caught up in the mix of debt and equity that they just stopped there. But the end result is you're trying to come up with a cost of capital that's lower that can push up your value. So I want you to play CEO for a moment. I'm going to show you two companies from way back in time, and you're going to be in charge of what you're going to fix in these companies to make them more valuable. The first company is a German software company run firm. So the easy fixes are gone, right? The cost cutting is not going to work. In fact, it's probably going to have the opposite effect. They're almost entirely funded with equity. Why? Because the people around the company, including the founders who are still big shareholders, did not like that. Primarily, or almost entirely equity funded, capital lower, everything else in the valuation is going to stay at it. But to be quite honest, there's a wealth transfer happening when you do this, right? The value of SAP goes up, but where is that additional value coming from? It's actually coming from taxpayers, right? But the biggest advantage of debt is a tax advantage. So it's something that no LBO person ever wants to talk about directly. They talk about value creation. No, it's not value creation. My suggestion is perhaps you should be investing a little bit more in Asia. That's the next growth market. So here are the changes I made. 70% reinvestment rate with much of that additional reinvestment happening in Asia and Latin America. Return on capital, I assumed, would stay at it, but that might be something to look at. Maybe the projects in those countries might have a slightly higher, lower return. I have to work it out. I did adjust the fact that now that you've got more country risk, things you can change that will make the value go up. You have to find, right? It's so much easier, value and control, when you have a badly managed company than when you have a company that for the most part, like SAP, is well managed, but has some blind spots. Yeah. Some of this seems like a well-managed company, that's the premium that we're going to realize with these actions. So you can always look at companies that are poorly managed and work out, if they always have different management, what would be the created by rolling up individual video stores, done very well. And then it hit disrupt. Just as it disrupted an earlier business, it got disrupted itself. By whom? By Netflix. Very first Netflix version. Remember, they used to mail out tapes and you'd mail them back. And then it was quite clear. And Walmart started offering that dollar rental where you walked in, you could rent a tape. So they were being assaulted from both sides. Netflix taking away some business. If I made you CEO of Blockbuster on the day this happened, and the debt ratio is 50-50, there's no advantage of changing debt mixes and they're probably slightly over 11. What's the first edict you're going to pass when you come in as a CEO? Stop opening stores. That's the most value creating action the next step, right? So you take the easy step first, and then you say, is there a core business we can say? The answer is no. And the pathway is let's go to zero. If the answer is yes, that you can find a group of maybe senior citizen homes where you put a blockbuster outside, they have a video player still, they're fighting the streaming thing, they don't want this Netflix streaming through, they many of your lessors want the sites back and you've locked it in for the next 11 years. Maybe you can negotiate a going away and say, look, we'll go away early. You can rent out to somebody else at a higher fee, but you can do it on your own terms. If you can see the apocalypse coming. but at least you've limited your damage to existing stores. They will continue to earn less than the cost of capital. And there you can say, is there a way I can get to the cost of capital by shutting my 50 most expensive stores? I don't need blockbusters in big cities. I'm going to shut them all down. The leases cost too much. So you can start to try to strip down and see if there's a stopping point, but it requires time. It requires that you not be pressured to have to do that. Yes. does not benefit from that because that increase in value is coming from taxpayers. The economy itself is not benefiting. So you don't want investing that's focused on just the financial side of the balance sheet. You need operations. But that requires work, right? Do this. You need to understand the business. So the people who do this tend to be people who are sector focused because they understand the business. Now, Barry D the cost of capital, the value effect goes away. It depends on what happens when you shut stores. If you shut stores and you get nothing to change the way a business is run. It's a probability that you can make that change. That probably can range from zero to 100%. If you have an activist investor who's powerful enough to say, look, I assess that property as an outside investor when you're investing in these companies, especially if they're badly managed and badly run? You're almost implicitly also making an assumption of maybe change will come here. So here are some of the things that might affect why that property will change. One is when in some countries, corporate governance laws have created more change because they made it easier for people to challenge companies. Europe, 30 years ago, you couldn't challenge existing management. in your sector. It's almost like every management in that sector wakes up saying, maybe that could happen to me. So when you look at studies that look at the likelihood of change of management, it's actually interesting studies because they're based on this statistical approach called probit, where you look at companies with management changes versus doesn't. Here are some of the common features you see in companies industries than others. Some industries seems to be embedded in the process that management just stays on. I mean, one of my problems with technology is what I call founder worship. It's less now, thank God, than it was 10 years ago. But think of the peak of tech companies five, six years ago. How we viewed the Mark Zuckerberg and the Brins and the Jeff Bezos of the world. We viewed them as saviors. Essentially, these people could do no wrong. to have created acronyms, magical words. If you do this, your value will go up. And I want to kind of expose those acronyms to what they are, CFROI, EVA. I mean, every consulting firm has its own acronym and essentially say ultimately value is value. You can't change the mechanics of value. These acronyms are shortcuts and sometimes shortcuts create consequences. So I'll take EVA, an approach that most people don't use, just to show you what can happen when you get focused They're both put together. The grain mass management rights is increasing the value. The value control is the change in the value. Value control comes inside the grain management. You're changing the company by making green that's more. In this case, it increases the value. I'm not sure what your question is. the more the worse it gets for the most part but small deals if you look at cash versus stocks i think there are four choices right cash stock combo no so there's a basic inside the deal so cash deals are smaller deals using cash you can get away with but as the deal gets larger so as the deal gets so with cash deals small cash deal there's a data pair but if you stop",
