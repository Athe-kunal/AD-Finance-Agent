  "text": " Thanks. question.. Okay, folks. A quick reminder, as a group is so i'm not the only one nagging everybody in a group because if you have people who are lagging in your group you might want to nag them as well because they'll eventually get it done always gets done but there will be people who infuriate you by working only countries, every continent. Could you value Coca-Cola by geography? North American operations, Asian operations, European. What's the advantage of doing that? Of breaking down Coca-Cola geographically and valuing individual geography. Get a sense of where the value at a corporate level is really being brought from. And also, it allows you to You're making assumptions. So let's say the way we compute equity risk, we take a weighted average, right? You know what the problem with that though is? That I never mentioned, your weights can change over time. If you're growing fast in Asia and you're mature in the US over time, and who has the time to work out what the weights will be one year from now? Whereas if you do a geographical based valuation, you don't have to worry about weights. Each part has its own growth rate. because most companies don't break down information on a piece-by-piece basis in enough detail for you to be able to do the piece-by-piece valuation. Let's follow up on that. One of the things we're going to talk about today is what's called some-of-the-parts valuation. In fact, there's an acronym that people use, SOTP. I never, the first few times I read it, I said, what the heck is that? The sum-of-the-pieces. it can if i replace value with price it can be all three if i truly value a company i should really get the same value because value is value whatever concerns me so but with price you're absolutely right the price can be equal the price can be great if the price is greater than the sum of the parts you might I'm going to argue that most of the time they don't do any some of the parts valuation. They do some of the parts pricing. You know what that means? They take each piece of the company, they'll price it. By doing what? Applying a multiple. It's actually back of the envelope. It's the kind of thing you would do after a dinner. You've had three drinks and somebody says, what do you think Disney's worth? Pull up the envelope. You pull up the EBITDA for each part. You multiply by the multiple for each part. It's not the kind of thing you do at most dinners. even try this even if the information that's a lot of messy assumptions and a lot of work a lot of calculations go through so to just complete the discussion of pricing, not a whole lot more to do by talking about the other regressions I ran. I showed you the PE ratio regression, right? I started with a scatterplot of price earnings versus growth, and then I ran a regression across the market of PE ratios against growth, beta, and payout ratios. So when I ran those statistics on this, it told me it was nonlinear. Now, can you share the screen? Thank you. Thank you for letting me know. Screen, you can see it now, right? Yeah, yeah. the scatterplot. When I ran the regression, then here's the only difference. Instead of having the growth rate, I had the log of the growth rate. The R squared of the regression is 56.6%. The PEG ratio actually did much better than the PE ratio in 2023. It's always the case. The three variables are growth, beta, and payoff. variable you've made it a different kind of relationship that you got to factor in when you think about low versus high progression so the next few pages you know don't expect to see i know i really put in there for your project remember one of the pieces of your project you're taking a look at your description is to look at is to price your company against the market i'm going to be a realist i don't expect have a U.S. company, you can use either the U.S. regression or the global regression. Which one's right? You're answering two different questions, right? Because in the first one, you say, given how other U.S. stocks are priced, is my stock underpriced or overpriced? And the second regression you're asking, given how global stocks are priced, is my stock underpriced or overpriced? Different questions, you can use your forecasted growth rate from your DCF. So you have the freedom for your company to specify how you come up with the ROE, the growth rate. You're not constrained to go to capital IQ and use those variables. Just plug them into the regression, get a predicted pricing for your company. So EV to EBITDA, EV to sales and EV to six, I have six multiples. multiples, you will drive yourself crazy. With every other sector, you have a choice. And if you have a sector where leverage varies widely across the sector, so take a look at the debt ratios. If they're very different across companies, you're better off using enterprise values because PE ratios are going to get skewed by how much leverage you have. So whether you use equity value or enterprise value is going to be driven by first whether you're doing financial service companies. If you're not, by how much difference in leverage you have. And finally, my preference is to work with a number that is not too affected by accounting choices. So if you feel your earnings per share net income are driven by too many accounting discretionary choices, you want to avoid those numbers. Because otherwise, what you might see as cheap might just reflect your accounting choices. In terms of whether you want to use current numbers trailing forward or really, really forward, it will depend on your company. across multiples? Remember, this is an empirical question. Look at the P-E ratios, look at the market cap. And if larger companies have lower P-E ratios or higher P-E ratios, just running a regression of P-E against market cap will tell you that. So it's not something you have to decide. Let the data tell you what to do. And in terms of how big a sample you need, if you want to run a regression, you need at least 10. Maybe nine you can expensive relative to the group you're comparing it to. It's not an absolute statement. It's a relative statement. That's why I used to call pricing relative valuation, but I've chosen to go with the pricing word because I think it reflects what you're doing much better. And second, when you do, you know, when you value ask, when you try to price something, you're going to have a really tough time finding something exactly like it. So I actually think of the world as divided to investors and traders. And I think I've mentioned this, traders price things, investors value things. Traders make money by buying at a low price, selling at a high price. So if you're a trader, you should be using multiples and comparables, even charts, because you're interested in playing the pricing game. Yes. So let's say I'm deciding which regression to use. to book ties much more closely to your DCF conclusion and makes your report easier to write, go for it. But remember what you did, because when people use pricing on you, remember that that bias also kicks in the way people pick multiples. But I think it does make sense to pick multiples you can explain more of, but a 50% R-squared versus a 40% R-squared is not different enough to drive that choice. There, you pick the 40% R-squ are much more intuitive. So when you talk to retailers about revenue multiples, they relate. Technology companies, especially money-making ones, is all about growth. And they talk about growth and earnings per share. P ratios. Financial service companies, big focus on return on equity because the equity is marked up to market. It's got to be regulatory equity. It's constrained. equity, enterprise value, enterprise value. Make sure it's uniformly estimated. Describe the multiple. Not fancy. Put up a histogram. Get a sense of what's high, what's low, the 10th percentile, the 19th percentile, the 25th percentile, the 75th percentile. Analyze the multiple. And in fact, when you describe the multiple, check to see how many companies you lose, because there is bias that gets created every time you lose. Analyze the multiple. Use a little based on its fundamentals, its cash flows, growth and risk. In relative valuation of pricing, you put a number on a company based on what other people are paying for similar companies. So sometimes, so when I tell people there are only two ways you could put a number, intrinsic valuation of pricing, they say, no, no, there's a third way. How about asset-based valuation? I'm going to very quickly point out in a few pages why it's not a third way. But for some, it seems like a third way, right? You take the assets, you value the individual assets, you sum them up, you get a value for the company. that 65% of all valuations done in the world now are done purely for accounting reasons? What drove this was, of course, the push in accounting towards fair value accounting. So you walk in Ernst & Young or at Deloitte and you go to the valuation section, you think they're valuing companies for transactions, maybe two out of 10 valuations for transactions. The bulk of the valuations are for restating numbers and balance sheets because the accounting rules require them away. So let's take each, you know, when you think about when asset-based valuation is likely to come into play. First, let's dispense with the notion that asset-based valuation is somehow a different way of doing valuation, because ultimately you've got to come up with numbers for the asset. And there are three ways you can do it. One is to do an intrinsic valuation of each asset, get cash flows in the asset, present value. The second is to do an asset-based valuation of Disney, I'm going to refuse on the spot. Why? Because if you want to value the theme parks, remember a big part of the value of the theme park comes from how well their movie business is doing. And now with streaming, how well their movie business is doing feeds into their streaming business. has its own financial statements. So you take a building and each building has a rental income, rental expenses, and each has a standalone financial. Much easier because now you're not trying to guess where do the costs go. And finally, if you're doing pricing, it's nice if you have a market for those individual assets. Here again, you can see why real estate companies, it's all pricing all the time because of? Not what you think it's worth. You might even actually have to attach a discount for a liquidity because you're trying to sell something quickly, especially if it's a big asset, you might not get what you think is a fair pricing. But liquidation valuation, again, you're trying to valuation approach we use? So I remember reading the description, I think it's FAS 157 was the original rule that described what fair value accounting's mission was going to be. And they talked a great deal about what a market participant would pay for an asset in an arm's length transaction. Let me repeat that again. pricing that they put on each asset. You know what they're required to do? They're required to do a discounted cash flow valuation. One of the most wasteful exercises I've seen in valuation practice. I just remember about eight, seven, eight years ago, I get a call, a fairly frantic call from the account. I forget which accounting firm it was that was called in by Fidelity to put a on that pricing should be roughly 2 billion, but they were getting only 200 million. They said, what should we do? We've tried everything. And I said, you can take the DCF and if you play enough with it, you can end up investment funds most recent pricing. Rather than tell you we've done an intrinsic valuation of this Uber holding and it's worth two billion. Accounting fair value I think should be called accounting fair price. So first thing is I would remove the fair value, make it fair price and allow people to back it up with just multiples and comparables. Do not use discounted cash flow models because this is not a issue. Liquidation, what are you going to do? You're going to get the best you can, right? So what does valuation even come into play? If this company or the valuable companies are going concern, it wouldn't be liquidating in the first place. That game's been truncated. That's why when you do discounted cash flow valuation, you put in that failure rate. Because once you fail, There are leakages in this process that we've got to deal with, and we'll talk about what those leakages are. But it's often far easier to do an intrinsic sum of the parts pricing than a sum of the parts valuation. And again, if you think about who might be interested in a sum of the parts valuation, you might be one of those long-term patient investors who buys companies that trade at less than were one of the few companies that actually gives you full information on each business. So this came right out of the financials. I didn't have to dig very deep. They give you revenues, EBITDA, operating income, capex, depreciation. In other words, it's almost like each of these businesses was treated like a standalone business. It's very unusual to have this much detail by business. So here's my first track. I'm going to do a sum of the parts pricing, Apply the multiple and average for the sector and add them up. Play devil's advocate. What am I going to miss when I do this? What am I assuming about each of United Technologies businesses then when I use the average for the sector? Yes. I'm sorry? Similar cash flow, similar growth. So first thing is, and so one of them is a higher growth than the rest. I'm missing that. Not that it's disappearing, it's actually slipping into it. So if there's cross business, then what's happening is the EBITDA for one business is being moved to the EBITDA of another. I'm applying the wrong multiple because my refrigeration systems is selling to my foreign security. So it's not disappearing. It's just in there, but in the wrong place. That's a problem when I do a couple like Disney, right? The theme park EBITDA might be 20% because my movie business was doing so well. I think if you just do a pricing based on stated EBITDA of the businesses, you often overstate the pricing of the company because those common costs then somehow get ignored. We'll talk about what to do when we do an intrinsic valuation. Is there a way I can fix the problem of these businesses not being like the average business? What do we do with traditional pricing to bring in the differences across companies? We did a regression, right? United Technologies, refrigeration systems, tax rate, and return capital. And I'm going to come up with a predicted multiple enterprise value for each of these businesses based upon these regressions. At least I've taken care of one of the problems. I'm no longer assuming these businesses are just like the average. I'm allowing for differences. The value that I got was $74.23 billion. So there's my regression number predict. the envelope 74 billion with these kind of finesse regressions but i really wanted to do a true intrinsic valuation who do i need for a true intrinsic valuation everything i need for any intrinsic valuation right i need cash flows and growth and risk so here's what i started with i started by estimating a cost of capital for each of the six businesses remember how we got bottom-up payers no we took instead of taking a weighted average i'm actually letting each one It's the safest and the riskiest business is their helicopter business, Sikorsky. But I gave them all the same cost of debt for the same reasons. I gave them the same debt ratio. The company is borrowing for all six businesses. I used the rating for the company and the cost of debt. But the bottom line is I have six different costs of capital. Why? Because I'm going to value each one separately. I have a cost of capital for each one. You can already see that if you're doing this for Coca-Cola, geographically, the beta is going to be the same. the reinvestment rate for each business at the cost of capital for each business. I have the fundamentals I need to drive the value of the company in there. I plug them in. And in fact, because I'm valuing each business separately, I can make my own adjustments. Some are high growth, some are already mature. I didn't have to put one size fits all. And you can see that I've actually assumed the foreign security business is a mature business with zero years of high growth. higher than either of the pricings, but that's neither here nor there. This is an intrinsic valuation of each of the six businesses. And here I want to tie up that loose end. And the loose end was that United Technologies had $408 million in corporate expenses that were unallocated. You know what that means, right? All my free cash flows are before these expenses. So these $408 million in expenses are still there. that I get as a sum of the parts DCF is 75.7 billion. I actually, when I did the pricing, got 74.2. I actually did a full-fledged DCF of the company overall. It's a consolidated valuation. I got 71.5 billion. And part of the reason was then I had to make one assumption about growth periods and it forces all of these businesses into one, right? The problem with marginal is you pick companies within the same market. Marginal tax rate is the marginal tax rate, right? It's going to be the same. So if you believe there are tax differences across companies, an effective tax rate is probably going to capture that better than marginal tax rates. So given a choice, I'd probably go with effective tax rates. But if you decide to go marginal, you have companies in multiple countries, and you're going to discover? They don't have an accounting department. So how did you get away with that? Well, corporate took care of that. You don't have an inventory. So what you're going to wake up to are unpleasant surprises afterwards. So I think you have to do that, right? You have to take the corporate expenses and decide what portion of that was due to this division. they prefer to run it out of headquarters so so that becomes the essentially that becomes a cost that headquarters building everybody who lives who stays there now g's headquarters were what connecticut huge space but nothing that g actually did came out of that space but think of all those expenses of maintaining the space all the people who work there presumably all of g's businesses and ask yourself, how am I going to draw the lines on separable businesses? How am I going to get the information? And how is it that you can so casually decide that something is trading at less than the sum of its parts? I think for every 10 times I hear about companies trading at less than the sum of the parts, maybe one out of the 10 is true. The other nine, I'm skeptical. You just think the company is undervalued. You use the sum of the parts as about, right? Tobacco companies were being sued. They said, my intrinsic value of Kraft Foods is actually being reduced because I worry about the spillover effect of cigarette lawsuits when the old US tax law required that all the income be taxed the US tax rate, there was actually an incentive for these businesses to spin off their foreign subsidiaries and let them stand alone because overnight their taxes drop. Yes sir. How often is like some companies subsidiary in some reason is the biggest in target for instance like buy areas? targeted businesses? Yes. What about a company like Amazon? People in the market say they're still AWS. I don't for a second think Amazon is worth it. Do you think, you know, AWS is really not the would you want to take Amazon Prime? I don't see how AWS is hurt by the rest of Amazon's businesses. So unless you could show me some kind of antitrust thing that's now going to be imposed on AWS because people don't like Amazon, if you spend AWS, it's not just another cloud company. It's not going to be the greatest company in the face of the earth. And Amazon is going to keep going. I mean, and I know that Scott is big on breaking up the big tech companies. He wants to break up Facebook into Facebook. I mean, those companies will be worth less as that part that if they break them into parts, right? Because it's the ecosystem that makes the networking benefits so high. So you take Instagram, you separate it from Facebook and you take Facebook and separate from and allow you to grow. So maybe value them twice. Once without the constraints imposed by being part of Philip Morris and one with the constraints and they're different. Every green energy business that's part of a fossil fuel company faces this problem, right? They compete against a standalone green energy company. They might be at a disadvantage in winning that bidding war because people say you're an ExxonMobil subsidiary and you're competing in this green energy company standing alone. 2019, of course, Alibaba was, I mean, the Chinese government was viewed as an ally for Alibaba until 2019, right? That things seemed to change and all of a sudden the Chinese government decided they're going to take a harder line with their biggest tech companies, Alibaba, TEDS, and JD. And ever since, Alibaba has been under a dark cloud. It's almost like Alibaba is throwing the, it's saying, look, you know, we break up into six smaller companies, yeah but that that's got to be a really strong remember any cost to capital argument i'm going to push back on right because costs of capital are very difficult to move by just breaking up and getting listed in a different market but there you could make it an intrinsic value argument if you can convince me that by breaking up into individual pieces you're able to have usually it cuts the other way right i gave all of by business is remember our test of return on capital being higher than the cost of capital we did that at the company-wide level but now i can do it by business so when i looked at g and as i said if this was five years ago the three businesses where they earned above their cost of capital were aviation healthcare and transportation there's a think of this as a three potentially good businesses the three that where they roughly Why don't they just shut it down? Obviously, people are not going to pay for it. The problem with GE Capital is it's entangled everywhere. GE Capital actually backs up many of the GE aviation sales that they do to their customers. It's backed up by GE Capital. GE's problem has always been because GE Capital is so entangled. And this was Jack Welch's worst legacy, is by bringing in GE Capital and entang. And over the last decade, Reliance has invested billions of dollars in Reliance Jio. Jio is a telecom business. And Jio's business model, if you look at it, is basically giveaway telecom services for nothing. I think every online company that has gone public in the last five, 10 years in India should give a third of their value to Reliance can see people saying things about Amazon that they weren't talking about two or three years ago. They're talking about how Amazon has let its online retail business kind of get, you know, they've been distracted. So I've seen things said about Amazon that suggest to me that the trust is fraying. And once it frays enough, you could potentially see people arguing. We don't want, you know, AWS to be part of Amazon because, or even by the middle of his tenure. Please get the process started on valuing private businesses. across public companies. You should see the accounting differences across private businesses, especially small private businesses. So let's take those two factors and look at why they become an issue in valuation. First, you know what I mean by no market value, right? Publicly traded company is a market price out there. And there are three levels at which you miss market prices. First is there are market values that you use as inputs into your DCF valuation. at the numbers again and i'm leaving it at that maybe you did more than look at the numbers there's a feedback effect right because if you get a three dollar value per share the market price is 300 this isn't a supremely overvalued company you probably got the units wrong are you it's it's amazing how much feedback you get from the market price that goes back into evaluation you don't have that with a private company you could get three dollars when the real value is three thousand of reasonable sex. If you go walk into, you know, Coke Industries, you know, you're going to get something that looks very much like public companies, but you walk into a small retail business that's owned by the person behind the counter, the county could be all over the place. I still remember somebody in this class about 10 years ago decided to value their flowers, their mother's flower shop, because she wanted a valuation all these post-it notes and took it to an accountant to pull the numbers together. But especially with small private business, the accounting could be all over the place. The third is with private, this is true in every business, with private businesses, there's line between the personal and the business becomes a hazy one, right? There's a company car, but at 3.30 in the afternoon, it seems to disappear for about well but most of the rest of them what exactly is the assistant to the equipment manager whatever his title was what do they do there are a lot of assistants to the equipment managers private businesses no that's sure and finally and this is a big deal and something to think about is many private businesses the owner doesn't pay himself or herself a salary what's the point anyway you get whatever's left over you're saying who cares when they do their financials they do it show you a couple of valuations but i remember about 25 years ago you know the owner of a candy company walks in into my office and she says i'd like a valuation for my candy company as if i'm sitting there what you know but she was all very persistent and i said why she said what do you mean why i said why do you want to value you and i gave her the reasons are you curious that could be just you know because you own a business you want come up with the value valuations of private companies are much more specific to the company you're valuing at the time you're valuing in the mode that's being used which means that private company appraisers you're going to have a much more difficult time replacing them with ai if they do their job right than public company. This candy business being sold to a publicly traded candy company, to Hershey's, very different set of circumstances. You made my job a lot easier and you're going to see why. Very unlikely that either of those individuals is diversified. You see why this matters, right? All of our calculations so far, when we did cost of equity, cost of capital, were built on the premise, the marginal investor is diversified. Therefore, the only risk they care about is the risk you cannot diversify away. This kind of removes the entire foundations for using beta, right? Because beta is built on the premise that the marginal investor is diversified. That's unlikely $12. And there's a bit of spread that I pay. But that's the cost of buyers for most of the public company. It can be tiny if I'm looking at a company like Apple. It can be much bigger if I'm looking at a likely traded stock because the spread is wider. But think of buying a farm or a plumbing business in a moment of weakness. You're tired. It's the end of the day. You're on your way home. statement, right? You buy it based on the income statement. In fact, I'll make this even more specific. My kids all had to go to get braces. This is an incredibly lucrative business. My dentist, his first name is Howie. He got rich just based on my kids, I think. And every time he'd come in, I'd wait for my kids and say, who the hell are you? So I'm your new dentist. So no, you're not. And I walk out. That's a key person discount, essentially the expectation that the person running the business walks out, there goes 20, 30, 40, 50% of the revenues. So we're going to talk about what that discount is and, might still be there, but it's a much smaller discount. So next session, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take an example of a private to private transaction and look at how these play out. And I'll be quite honest, this is part of valuation where this is the most fudge that we're going to do, because there's no precise answer, but at least we can think of a way of reasoning our way to the diversification effect, the liquidity discount of the key person.",
