  "text": " Tack. I'm going to lay the groundwork for what's coming and set the table. But before I do that, I want to identify what I think are the three biggest reasons valuations go off the tracks. And none of the reasons have anything to do with, can you estimate cash flows? Can you get a beta or a cost of equity or a cost of capital? So I'm going to start today's session with a test on how biases and preconceptions can drive your valuation. trouble now is the news and you're wondering. A bit of both. Okay. Anybody else pick a company? Yes. Upstream. And why did you pick the company? Innovating and having a hard time getting up. Anybody else? No Netflixes, Teslas, Facebooks. When you pick a company, remember it's not in a blank slate, right? every time I valued Microsoft I found it to be overvalued you name the price over that overvalue two dollars five dollars ten dollars strange right one of the great success stories of U.S. equity markets of the 20th century I wouldn't have touched it one step of the way now I could give you access to every single valuation of Microsoft I've done over the last 20 something years you could dig through the numbers looking for clues as to why I found it The top shelf, I have my very first Mac 128K. Those of you who don't remember, this was the very first Macintosh. It came without a hard drive. It came with a floppy drive, and everything had to go back and forth. I'm an Apple user. And to me, Microsoft has always been the Darth Vader of technology. For those of you who are Star Wars fans, let me be specific about which Darth Vader I'm talking. I'm not talking Anakin Skywalker to ignore what I've done. No, I didn't say that because I know that's pointless because you're going to look at what I've done and whether you like it or not, it is going to affect your valuation and show. program, it shifted to between $20 and $25. I talk to managing directors. Many of them are old students of mine. I don't do any M&A work. But one of the things I tell them is when you give your team a valuation assignment, for God's sakes, don't throw a number in there. Say, oh, by the way, I think it's roughly $100. Because if you do that, it is going to affect the numbers you get back. So bias comes from what you how being paid for a valuation can affect your valuation. Now, this is about 30 years ago, there was a company called Lynn Cable. It's obviously a cable company. At that time, AT&T had this option to buy 51% of Lynn Cable at an appraised value. Lynn Cable was a publicly traded company. The option was written in terms of appraised value. So time for the option to be exercised comes about. per share. The other comes back at $105 per share. I want you to guess which side came back with $105 and which side came back with $155. Any guesses? Who came back with $105 per share? Because that's your job, coming to the lowball number. Of course, it's backed up by a 300-page valuation report, assumptions, scenarios, et cetera. And you came back with $155 because you work for the seller. You both did your jobs. In fact, the difference was so large, I've been down multiples of, right? We'll come back and talk about good and bad reasons. But if you're Washington Perilla, you're right in the middle here, right? You don't want to piss off either side too much. It's a financial term because you've got to work with both sides in the future. 105, 155, where's the safest place for you to be? Right down the middle, 130, right? They came back with $127.50. I want to let you in on a little secret in valuation. If you're ever asked to value something, shares of the company. It already colors your valuation. If you sold short, it colors your valuation. People often talk about whether you have skin in the game. Last week when I valued Tesla, I think somebody, I don't know who it was, Ross Gerber maybe, I said, he has no skin in the game. And I said, if by skin in the game, you mean I don't own three Teslas and half my wealth tied up in Tesla. You're absolutely right. That's not skin in the game. That's your easy one. You're a venture capitalist looking at the same company. Thinking about investing your money, you know how the venture capital process works. I supply capital, you give me a share of your company. Is my bias going to be to come up with a high value or a low value? When was the last time on Shark Tank that Kevin O'Leary said, oh, you want a million? I'll give you divorced. And your soon-to-be ex-spouse is going to get half the value of your business. You hire an appraiser to value your business, you value it yourself. Is your bias to come up with a really big number so you can give half of that really big number to your spouse or a really small number? In fact, you're going to say, I'm a terrible business person. This business is probably worth nothing. Half of nothing is nothing. life. To ignore it, I think, doesn't make it go away. Let's move on. You guys know how equity research is structured. You have sell-side equity research and buy-side equity research. Anybody want to tell me the difference between sell-side equity research and buy-side equity research? What do sell-side equity research analysts do? there because they get visible. They work for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. By side, equity research analysts toil away in dark rooms or maybe lighted rooms. But basically, you don't see them very much. values down? And if so, why? Yes. Who is your target group? Who you are trying to keep happy? That's really the question, right? You're preparing this research for clients, but the clients don't pay. the business with the company and now they have a good relationship. Even your clients for the moment are happy because there might be a front turning effect. When you get on CNBC and say, this company is a good buy and go up $2, at least for the moment. Let's play out what happens when you put a sell recommendation. Put a sell recommendation. First, what happens to your relationship with the company? You had a journalist burning their sources. You're doing something similar, right? force as heck. You know, my recommendations outnumber sell recommendations nine to one. In fact, sell side equity research analysts have created this really elaborate system of saying sell without ever saying sell. I talked about strong buys, semi-strong buys, weak buys. You know why they create the system, right? When an investment bank says we've lowered this stock from a strong buy to a weak buy, you know what you should hear? Sell. Just tell them that the stock is a good company to buy. So you do your research, you go into his or her office. What is the news that will get you a good reception that the company is a good company or a bad company? You already own a million shares. You're expecting reaffirmation. Remember the Jack Nicholson line from a few good men? a friendly merger. You have four people in the room. You got the acquire, the CEO, or the management of the acquiring team, the management of the target team, the banker for the acquiring team, the banker for the target team. So before we even look at bias, does everybody in this room want this deal to go through? It's a what do you have to convince the acquiring firm share? Remember, this is going to be used by the acquiring company CEOs to convince their shareholders and the board that this is in fact good for them. So when you value the target company, what do you have to show your shareholders? That the value you're getting really bad. It's a good deal. I'm going to say some caustic things about M&A in general, but one of the biggest reasons valuations in M&A become almost pointless is the process is too biased. The deal makers are the deal analysts who thought this was a good idea, but that's become the standard practice, right? The bankers doing the deal. They're going to go to the company and say, no, don't sell it. Look, they told, they're telling you they're paying too little. There you might actually end up with two valuations, one for internal use that your board uses and one for the rest of the world where you say, you know what? Hostile acquisition valuations are a complete and total mess because it's more a strategic tool than it is a valuation, a tool to use to negotiate and win this battle. we've been talking about so far. That somehow valuation is an objective search for the truth. That we're sitting with numbers and working with numbers and therefore we're being objective. Let it go. Accept the fact that bias is here. And if you're getting paid for the valuation, bias is even more real. My only advice is be honest with yourself. Here's my advice to you. Once you pick the company you're required to do. Before you do a study or a test, you're supposed to put down on paper what your priors are, what you think you're going to find in that study. If we'd known from the beginning, when you look at research, this is where this research is coming from. This is what they're fighting. Bias is a given. You can't ignore it. Midas will be open and honest about it. Put it down. Put down your pride. Let's move on to the second big misconception about valuation. If I do a good valuation, I'm going to get the right answer. When does this get started? Probably in first grade, kindergarten. and I told you this is 59th and 60th semester I'm teaching valuation. Every semester that I've taught this class, about eighth and ninth and 10th week, somewhere towards the two-thirds part of the class, a few people from the class, maybe 15 or 20 people, mostly engineers, quantitative people show up. With the valuation, put it down. I'm done with my valuation. They become fixed income. It's so much more comfortable sitting there with a bond, right? Maturity is given, coupon. I don't have to worry about default risk. There's not this growth and margin, all that crap floating around. It's healthy early on that equities are not for you. Go value bond. I think they're incredibly boring, but maybe boring is what stirs your straw. What stirs your drink, I think. You can't do it. Be open about it. The fact is, this in 2019. It's been around 150 years. It used to be a public company in the last century, was taken private, is going back public again. So here's my first question. Levi Strauss and you got left. And this is a variant of the question I asked you at the start of the last class. Which of these two companies can you value more precisely? And the answer is, it's Levi Strauss. Strauss easy for you to value. Lots of history, established business model. You know exactly how they make the money. Everybody has exactly those advantages. Everybody's valuation of Levi Strauss is going to be as precise as yours. Where's the payoff? In contrast, think of a company like Lyft. Most people give up. I include most VCs, most investors. They price the company. They might do what everybody else is doing. The very fact that you sat down and tried to build a business in a more healthy way. Which brings me to my third misconception about valuation. If I make my model bigger, it's going to get better. I'll give away how old I am by telling you what I used on my first valuation. It was a 1988 thing at a value company. Sort of class. You know what the first thing I had to do was? I had to write with my hand and a pen to the company asking for an annual report. and a pencil. I learned very early on, no pens, only pencils. Because you make a mistake with a pen, you're going to have a page full of junk. And a calculator. And a very early version of a calculator. There was no present value function. The HP-12Cs were just starting to come out, I think, the very first financial the summer. And he calls me in the middle of the summer and says, Dad, I have a question. He never, but don't you need numbers from them? I said, I need six numbers. Why would I be forecasting the other 494? This sounds like an exercise in distraction. When you build these incredibly complex models, two things happen. One is what I call input fatigue. Have you ever felt it? I'll describe what it feels like. it. It's a deeply satisfying option to exercise. Deeply dissatisfying things happen afterwards. Because it usually takes a form of picking up the annual report, throwing in your managing director's face, and you do it yourself. That's a deeply satisfying moment as it leaves your hand. And then bad things happen after that that we want to talk about. You think about it for a moment, but then you remember the rent you're move on. It's amazing how quickly the random numbers roll out and how difficult it is to tell when the output comes out what was random and what was not. Here's another little secret in valuation. You're doing a valuation with a lot of random number inputs. The best way to hide it is have a lot analyst had put was 85. So I called the analyst. I knew him and I said, why do you like the company so much? What is it about the company? He said, I didn't do it. I said, what do you mean you didn't do it? Your name's in the report. It says $85. Who did it? He said, ValueMac did it. I said, who the heck is ValueMac? He said, that's our in-house valuation model. He said, what did you do? Sneak into your office in the middle of the night, value the company and leave it on your desk? into its constituent parts. Because change in working capital is a line item. But if you break working capital down, there's inventory and receivables and payables. You're saying, what? I'm incapable. I'll confess. I'm incapable of forecasting days receivable for the next 30 years. If you are able to do it, I'm in awe. But if you cannot do that, what's the point of breaking it down? One of the pushbacks I got in the Tesla evaluation is, why aren't you breaking the revenues down when you're not, when in doubt, aggregate. You know what I mean by that? So if you're taking a company where you have five businesses and you have no idea how they're going to evolve, but you think that they will all add to value, do the consolidated numbers, large numbers. You're better off forecasting an aggregated number than individual line items. So I'm going to push for simplicity, not for the sake of simplicity, because it can be honest about it. We have a job, we want a higher number. But these are the forces that kind of impinge on valuation. Teaching people the mechanics of valuation is easy, but teaching people how to deal with these three forces sounds mildly familiar. Whenever you use a multiple price earnings, EV to EBITDA and comparables, 15 companies, you're not valuing companies, you're pricing them. Nothing wrong with it, but it's a different way. You're judging how much to pay based on what other people are paying. And there's a third way you can put a number on an asset. And this is perhaps the only part of valuation where you get something new and different coming to play. When you have an asset whose cash flows are contingent on something happening, the basis for all of these approaches. If you're looking at a publicly traded company, you pick a publicly traded company to value. If you believe markets are efficient, the game is already over. You see what? What's the best estimate of value for a publicly traded company in an efficient market? Right now, if I ask you, what's the best estimate of value for Tesla and you believe markets are efficient? $171 per share. Game's over. the correction happen? That becomes the basis of every investment philosophy, right? You are assuming markets make mistakes and you're making assumptions about how they correct the mistakes, but the kinds of mistakes and the corrections you're assuming are different depending on whether you're doing intrinsic valuation or pricing or option pricing. So let's start with discounted cash flow valuation. Discounted cash flow valuation is the most common notion of intrinsic value is a waste of time but in intrinsic valuation you start with the premise that there is an intrinsic value and you're going to try to find it it's a little bit like the search for the holy grail though you know people have been searching for the holy grail from the beginnings of you know of christianity two thousand years have been said how often have they found it i think indiana jones came a little close but i what you might need to assume to make money on your discounted cash flow valuations. First, you have to assume that markets make mistakes. Reasonable assumption? I don't think you'll find a single person push back on you on that assumption. Even the firmest believer in efficient markets will concede that markets make mistakes. I was RA for Gene Farmer, won the Nobel Prize for the efficient market hypothesis in 1981 when he was at UCLA in 82. strangers profession. Don't ask me how they stay in business. I mean, the analogous analogy out of it's like starting a plumbing business called floods are us. And here's what you do. You have a leak in your house. You call me and I leave a flood and I send you a bill. Would you ever pay me? But we do this all the time with active. Because hope springs in turn. But let's say you're special. You found a market mistake. Let's give the market mistake a name. hope again and you pray again. Maybe it'll happen. Maybe it won't. But let's talk about the advantages and disadvantages of intrinsic slash discounted cash flow valuation. I know many people claim to be Warren Buffett followers. And one of the things Warren Buffett has said is he doesn't buy shares in a company, he buys a piece of a business. If you truly believe that, intrinsic valuation they have a long time horizon, the end of which the client says, whatever you've done for me lately and the way we level up is we look at the actual market price. But at least in theory, if you're willing to disconnect the investment from the price and you say, look, I get the cash flows, I'm okay with this. That's at the heart of why some people find it appealing. What are the disadvantages? people using intrinsic valuation. Let's say you do an intrinsic valuation of every company in a sector. Is it possible for every company in a sector to be overvalued on an intrinsic valuation basis? Sure, right? Because each company, you look at the price, you look at the cash flows. Yeah, you can have every company. You're saying, so what? If you believe in intrinsic valuation, you shouldn't be buying any of those companies, right? And let's say you look across the market and everything you look at looks overvalued, overvalued, to price them. Because if you say sell, sell, sell in every company you look at, you're not going to be an equity research analyst. So this is not about good or bad. It's about what's your job description. Your job description as an equity research analyst or as a portfolio management require you to do pricing. it is nice if you can have a long time horizon you see how that helps you because remember you buy something because the price is different from the value and then you hope and pray that the price will adjust to value assuming you're right in the first place on value there's a greater chance of that correction happening if you have a five-year time horizon than if you have a six-month because they can be their own catalyst. You're ready to give up hope. There's no chance I can do that. You're right. You don't have $100 million and maybe a platform on CNBC to broadcast. Remember, it's not just CNBC. It's the fact that they've invested $100 million, $500 million that gives them. But don't give up hope. You could perhaps find some catalysts that might cause the price to adjust well. What are those catalysts? crowd. You're buying Facebook when everybody else is throwing up their hands. You're selling Tesla when everybody else is buying. You're saying, so what? I'm going to ask you, when you were a kid and there was recess, did what you do get affected by where everybody, I'm not asking this in a good way. It's who you are as a person. Some people are natural group followers and some people are natural contrarians. If you were the kind of looking for other companies like yours, and you're trying to compare the pricing across these companies. You're very quickly going to run into a problem. Price per share across companies is not comparable. Why? Because if you're comparing across software companies, you're implicitly assuming the market's right on average across software companies, but it's getting individual companies wrong. You found the cheap software stock. And the correction is more likely here because it's more visible, right? So if you're going to find pricing to be better suited for you than valuation because you're always going to find something that looks cheap relative to the sector. And how do most mutual fund managers get judged? If you go to Morningstar and they do rankings, they can judge against times earnings, everything else trades at a thousand times earnings, you buy. The problem is that the entire sector is overpriced. You're going to get a correction. Your only consolation price might be that you lost only 80% of your money, whereas everybody else lost 95%. Pricing doesn't meet. So when people talk about something being cheap on a pricing basis, I mean, if you pay 100 times earnings for a company, are you assuming that the company will have high growth in the future? Absolutely. By paying 100 times earnings, you're implicit. If I ask you how high the growth, you haven't thought that through, right? You see how dangerous this is? Basically, you're paying pricing based on a story of this company's high growth. By keeping it implicit, you don't even see how huge to price a picasso what do you need But I'll give you one thing that can actually augment the benefits of pricing. When you price something, it can be underpriced or overpriced, right? If you're underpriced, you buy it. You're overpriced, you sell it. Most mutual funds in the US are long-only funds, which means they can only buy things. money even as the market is down 20%. Citadel made $16 billion last year. Whether they got lucky, I don't know. But no, you can see why hedge funds can make money. D.E. Shaw made $8 billion. So if you can play both sides of the pricing game, you augmented the benefits of pricing. Take a pause, though, and accept that there are some Value is very difficult to do. A currency? US dollar. You can't value the dollar. You can price it. Exchange rate. If you're a good currency, your pricing should increase over time. If you're a bad currency, your pricing should decrease over time. What's a good currency? A good currency. What makes a currency a good currency? What are the characteristics you want for a good currency? I'm sorry? You want to pay for things. currency. I actually left 100 Swiss francs in my pocket in 2016 on a trip to Switzerland, found it three years later, and actually bought more than I did in 2016. It's nice to have a currency with deflation. This is the good thing about fiat currencies, really. Would you want 1,000 Venezuelan bolivar in your pocket? You put 1,000 Venezuelan bolivar. First, is it a good medium of exchange? I don't even know in Venezuela whether you could pay for things with bolivar. except only dollars. The Indian rupee is a medium of exchange in India, unless of course you had a 500 rupee note five years ago with the demonetization, you played a little game, which was really dangerous. And it has, so you can see that within currencies, you can have good or bad currencies. I'll leave you thinking about where you'd put Bitcoin in that spectrum. Because that's really going to determine whether you should pay 23,000 for Bitcoin, right? currencies. That's why gold prices historically have gone up when inflation is high. Or when there are crises, you abandon paper currencies because they're dependent on governments and banks. And you say, I don't trust those guys. That's why I call Bitcoin millennial gold. There's a lot of 30-year-olds that I don't want to hold gold, but I don't trust anyone. Well, good luck with Bitcoin. Gold has a much longer history of holding its value. My point is when you're asked to value each one, I put a number in each one. I can either price the properties or value the properties. It is just a subset of one of the other approaches. And we'll come back and talk about when you might have to do asset-based valuation. It might be because you're doing a liquidation valuation or a sum of the parts valuation. And accounting increasingly, make the judgment. What do I think will best suit me? But don't get too caught up with it because you might have to revisit the choice. So intrinsic valuation pricing, let's go to the third and final way you can put a number on an asset. Now, you know what makes an option an option. It's a security unlimited profits. File that away. Because when you know, we will spend some time on option pricing models. But, you know, if you think about direct examples of options, of course, there are lots of direct. contingency. And there's one example we're going to delve into, which is when you buy shares in a deeply troubled company. Let me be specific about what makes this company deeply troubled. It's a big money losing company. The history of losing money. It's not just one year. There's lots of debt. What's hanging over the head of this company? If you're losing money and you have a lot of debt, what are you worried about? I'll concede when I put an option pricing value on some of these, that there's a lot of noise. But you know why I'm gonna persist? Because there's insight you're gonna get about what drives the value of these assets that comes from using an option pricing framework. And I'll give you the most significant one. When you do a discounted cash flow valuation, and you increase the risk of the asset, what should happen to value? God, my stock is up 80%. This is so troubling. It's downside risk that you worry about, right? And what did I do in the option payoff diagrams for you with the downside risk? I limited it. I said, you can't lose more than you paid. Risk becomes your ally. And that's a huge insight. Because if you decide to buy equity in airlines, please don't buy equity in a deeply troubled, stable airline. I don't even know what that means. But they lost 100 million last year. limits of modern. So you're going to be doing things that are essentially, you know, an option pricing purist is going to plan to really put an option pricing model in there, where we're going to be, you know, the underlying asset might not be traded, the variance might not be observable. It's messy. So be very clear about where option pricing fits into your agenda, because it's not about putting a number per se, but getting a different perspective on what drives value. And it's good to have everything in your toolbox. Don't become too focused on, I do only intrinsic valuation. I don't believe in pricing. You're still at the mercy of markets. You can believe in it or not believe in it. But remember, who delivers the rewards and punishments eventually is the market. You have to understand pricing even if you don't do pricing. So when we start on Monday, we're going to start on packet one. And we're going to start by looking at structure of discounted cash flow models",
