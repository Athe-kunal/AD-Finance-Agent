I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording. I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording. Thank you. a whole host of crap is going to come at you right after spring break. Remember, if you want to get feedback on your DCF, I think you need to get your evaluation done by March, the end of March. It's optional. You don't have to do it, but I would strongly recommend that you get your intrinsic evaluation done because things are only going to get more compressed as you get towards the end of the semester. So get the intrinsic evaluation out of the way. I would send you a more detailed email and kind of a to-do list remember last session, we were talking about analyst estimates of growth and how a lot of people in the value companies use analyst estimates because the assumption is they must know more about the company than I do. So I want to start with that question. Do they actually know more? And if so, can you use their growth rates in valuation? So let's take analyst estimates and I'm going to't do very much relative to historical growth. Problem? Yes. The growth rate is not a good estimate of future growth. This is the most damning indictment, right? Even if it's a growth rate in earnings per share, it doesn't do a very good job once you get past one quarter ahead of two quarters ahead. Also a problem. And finally, if you use an analyst estimate of growth as your growth rate for your company, my question is, what's what drives your growth as a company. How much you reinvest, how well you reinvest. So let's take a very simplistic example. Let's assume the first growth, reinvestment growth, the second growth, efficiency growth. They both look the same in hindsight, but here's the difference. If I just look at that growth, I'd rather have efficiency growth today. So if I can raise my return on capital from 7.5% to 10%, you can already see what next. In fact, somebody tell me mathematically what the growth rate is going to be next year. If you reinvest nothing, but all you do is raise your return on capital from 7.5% to 10%. Right now you make 75 million, right? Next year, how much are you going to make? 100 million. You're going to have a 33.33% growth rate next year because you're able to improve your return on capital. to value a company, you have to make a choice. Are you valuing equity? Are you valuing the entire firm? And within equity, you can say, am I going to take the lazy way out of looking at earnings per share and dividends, or I'm going to look at pre-cash flow equity. The way you think about how much you reinvest and how well you reinvest is going to be determined by the choice you make. Let me be specific. If you're looking at earnings per share where you're going to see us use book values. Everywhere else when we talk about debt and equity, it's always market values. When you compute accounting returns, we use book values. I'm going to come back and ask, why is that? Why the focus on book value? So with earnings per share, retention ratio becomes what you reinvest. Return on equity becomes how well you reinvest. Let's move to free cash flows equity. With free cash flows equity, you're not assuming that everything you don't pay come up with as an equity investor. You divide that by net income. You come up with what's called an equity reinvestment rate. So pause and think about it. Retention ratio versus equity reinvestment rate, what the differences are. Retention ratio, you're just taking dividends as what's paid out, whatever's retained is reinvested. With an equity reinvestment rate, you're actually looking at what the company's putting back into the business. You can say a company can reinvest more than its net income by raising fresh capital. Yes. How would that come into the equation? It would show up in the net capex and change in working capital being greater than the net income. So you might have 50 net income and reinvest 300. Your equity reinvestment rate is going to be 600%. So you will grow earnings, but you're growing it by raising fresh capital. have negative equity reinvestment rates, what are you doing as a company? You're shrinking as a company. We're opening the door. So already you can see with equity reinvestment rates, you get more flexibility. You can deal with really high growth companies or shrinking companies. You can't do that with retention ratios. And because you're focused on what you're investing back in your operating assets, the way I'm going to measure return on equity is going to be slightly different. income, some of it comes from your cash and some of it comes from your operating assets. And if you look at book equity, some of that equity is invested in operating assets and some of it is invested in cash. So there's a version of return on equity where you take the cash out of the process. What do you do? You take the income from cash out of your net income. So your net income will be net of that amount. And when you do your book equity, you net out cash from book equity. I'm not focused on how much of your net income is going back into the business. I'm looking at the percentage of your after-tax operating income you're putting back into the business. And here I'm looking at the total reinvestment, not just the equity portion. So my numerator becomes the total reinvestment, net capex plus change in working capital. And my denominator becomes the after-tax operating income. I'm staying internally consistent. If I focus on free cash flow to the firm, I want to look at the percentage of my capital. You can already see that people are sloppy. I see people multiplying retention ratios by return on invested capital, reinvestment rates by return. You can't do that. Consistency demands that you make your choice upfront and define how much you reinvest and how well you reinvest based on those choices. So I know it sounds incredibly abstract. So were all reporting really high returns on equity. We didn't know fully at that time that they were pushing the limits on these numbers. They were going to riskier business and they should. And the regulatory authorities were not catching up. So I'm going to ask you a question. Let's say it's September of 2008, the crisis hits. And one of the things that regulatory authorities decided was it had been too lax, that banks needed more capital to keep going. So in October or November of 2008, the regulatory capital requirements at banks was raised about 30%. Let's say you're looking at the Wells Fargo numbers from June. Let's say none of those numbers have changed. Net income hasn't changed. and discount model why you care so much about what the regulatory capital authorities are thinking because if they make those requirements more restrictive it's going to have an impact on your return in equity by having the impact on your return equity it is going to have an impact on your expected growth so this is the most simplistic sustainable growth model it's been used for 50 or 60 years people use in all kinds of bad places but implicitly when you use this approach you're Apple has a 35% return on equity because whatever invest makes a huge return. So the first way to hire return equity is to take great projects. So much work and it's so difficult to do. So what's the second way you can pump up your return equity? Every real estate developer knows how to do this. What do you do? You borrow money. How does that push up the debt ratio. You're saying, why should I care? You see why you should care. I'm going to take an example. This is the late 90s. It's a Brazilian beverage company called Brahma. It's since been renamed as Embev. It's one of Latin America's biggest beverage companies now. And it's controlled by the 3G cap, this well-known private equity group in Brazil. So when I first looked at Brahma, the first thing that jumped out to me, they had a 31% return. 1%. Let's see what they're doing. They're borrowing money at 5.61%, investing in a project making 19.91%. That difference of 14.3% goes to the equity investors. That's a great attraction of borrowing money. So out of the 31% return equity, 19.9% comes from projects. The remaining I'd use a lever beta. This is the reason that we lever betas because it at least forces us to think about, hey, what will using more debt do to my cost of it? So sustainable growth with earnings per share, retention ratio, and return. But we talked about its limits, right? You have a company that's, you know, the most my growth rate can be with this approach is it cannot exceed my return because the retention ratio is 100%. Remember last session, we talked about free cash flow equity and cost of equity and how that balance plays out. This is another way to find your optimal debt ratio. But here's what you cannot do. You can't focus on maximizing return on equity and say that increases my value of equity. Because maximizing your return on equity might come at a debt ratio that's so stratospheric that your cost of equity is also really high. So if nothing else, you can take the difference between ROE and cost of equity and look at how that difference changes as your debt ratio changes. than just the offering. So it's a different, more focused vision. And because you're looking at reinvestment rates, you're no longer constrained to be between 0 and 100. You can have more than 100% or less than 0%. So I'm going to try this again on a company. And I'm going to go back in time. You look at Coca-Cola, right? And this is without capitalizing brand name advertising. So it might look different. In fact, we can ask the question, what will the numbers look at their numbers, it reflects it. Their non-cash net income was about 11.7 billion. So what I'm doing is taking the net income, subtracting out the income from the cash balance. It was tiny, 105 million. Their non-cash book equity was about 18.3 billion. Took the book equity, subtracted out the cash balance. Their non-cash return equity is 64%. It's astounding, right? So if I divide the $957 million by the $11.7 billion, the reinvestment rate is 8.18%. So if I take those numbers as a given, 8.18% times 64% gives me an expected growth, which is not bad given the fact that they're reinvesting almost nothing, 5.22%. Now, Ed, help me out here. If I capitalize brand name advertising, first, what's going to happen to my non-cash return? Still great, but much more believable. I don't believe that Coca-Cola is making 64%. So your return on equity is going to come down. You're saying that's going to be terrible. My growth rate is going to drop off. Not really, right? Because what else is going to change? My equity reinvestment rate now has to include advertising as part of my capex. I'm going to get a much higher equity reinvestment rate. You say, will the product work out to 5.22%? You wish. focusing on free cash flow equity and non-cash earnings. Which brings us to the third approach to sustainable growth. Here's the most generic, right? You're trying to value the firm. Now you estimate reinvestment as a percentage of your after-tax operating income that goes back into the business, no longer net out the debt, and you return an invested capital. Now, I want to say something. I use the word return on capital, return on invested capital, Anybody want to try? Yes. That's the actual capital being used. So why don't we do that to cost of capital? Because on cost of capital for an investor, you are seeing how much return the investor gets. You're going down a dangerous road, right? Remember what we said about every DCF? What's every DCF? It's an acquisition, exercise and acquisition valuation. equal to its cost. This is why I don't like fair value accounting. They're taking away ammunition I need to decide whether a company is taking good projects. Every project, good and bad, will have a return on capital equal to the cost of capital. How is that useful? I'd rather that you told me what is actually invested. I might still have to do inflation adjustments on it and what you're making because it gives me a better measure of what this company has actually earned on its projects. We'll 90s, one of the stars of the market was Cisco. Cisco went from a market cap of $4 billion in 1990 to a market cap of $400 billion 10 years later, 1999. well at the same time. Now you can see why they were a star company. Take the product of those two numbers, the expected growth rate you get is 36%. And here is a cautionary note. In 2000, they were a star company. That's what the numbers look like. They grew through acquisitions. The next decade, Cisco continued to have this high reinvestment rate. They continued to do acquisitions. You know what number changed? This 34% return on capital dropped about 8% to 9%. What does that mean? Instead of doing 10 acquisitions, you had to do 50 acquisitions or do 10 bigger acquisitions, and already your game gets more difficult to win. You're coming off a dot-com boost. You now have an economy that's slowing down. Things both within the sector and outside the sector were changing. And if I'd used the 34% growth rate for Cisco, I'd have found them to be fairly valued in 99. why we went back and capitalized R&D and capitalized leases because we wanted to make them part of investment capital because accountants are not doing it right. If that were the only fixes life would be simple. So if you could trust accountants to just be okay, those are the two things that they They take a restructuring charge or a write-off. You can see, I'm not picking on a card that you're doing it. They're doing the right thing. Let's say you write off 35 billion. You know how you write it off. You write off enough so you're earning a decent return on the project. So you've written off 35 billion for $50 billion. You're saying, of course, I can see them writing it off. Let's say it's two years later. You're looking at Chronicle's badge. You're going to take the book equity, the book debt, the cash. You're going to divide by the operating income by that number. And you know what you're going to include. I don't know how many of you have trouble sleeping. But if you do, I have a fix. About 15 years ago, I wrote a paper on measuring accounting returns. Incredibly boring paper. But if you, it was all about, so there's nothing technically difficult about the paper. It's about things like, what do you do about restructuring charges? What about Goodwill? Goodwill is a nightmare in an accounting return capital. And here's why. in hindsight, we get it, right? Because when you get goodwill impairment, it's accountants saying, that was stupid goodwill. There are a lot of these measurement issues. And the reason I say that is return-versed capital has become this magic bullet at consulting firms. What's your ROIC? You tell me what the ROIC is, I can tell you everything about your company. And I compute the return-versed capital for every publicly traded company. I'm intimately aware of both its strengths, sustainable growth, sustainable growth, as I said, works if you assume that things are in steady state. So if you think in terms of the life cycle, you know where sustainable growth will work for you in running a company, right? Mature companies that have hit a steady state. You know how many companies that are like that in the world today? I don't think of too many. Businesses are getting disrupted. Even something like Coca-Cola and Kraft T capital, the greater the potential for doing it, right? I mean, if you have 30% return on capital, don't put efficiency growth. You're already pretty efficient. But if you have a 3% return on capital, you could potentially argue that this company should be able to improve its return on capital and through that get growth. So I'm going to set up an example. I'm going to show you five companies, all of whom have the same growth rate. But I want you to think like an investor slash appraiser type analyst but they're getting efficiency. Good, right? You're getting one year of growth rate, but that growth is still good growth. Is there a company where you can't even say any good things about the growth rate? What is it about three that should terrify you? They're reinvesting a huge amount, 200%. They're earning a 5% return on capital. So they're going to keep growing at 10% every year. And every year they're going to get less value. You see why? Because that 5% that they're earning All I'm saying is when you look at the growth for your company, there you're going to see a 15% growth. Break it down. How much is coming from improving returns? How much is coming from reinvestment? Because this is your starting point for assessing, is this the kind of company where growth is going to add value, destroy value, or do nothing? So I'm going to end the growth section by focusing in on the most generic way to predict revenue growth. What's going to drive that growth rate? You're going to look at the size of the market, your market share, what will combine your company's competitive advantages. We'll talk about the pieces that go to the puzzle, but the first piece of the puzzle is revenues and revenue growth. Second step, I'm going to stop and ask you, well, your margins right now are crappy. What will your target margins look like? You're growing, the higher that number is going to be. The less efficiently you're growing, the lower that number is going to be. Revenue growth, I'm going to argue with those three inputs, you can move the world. You can be any kind of company with those three inputs, I should be able to value the company. very much. I want to get away with reinvesting nothing. A sales to capital ratio that's infinite. So obviously, you can pick whatever number you want. You can make any company with any number you want. You want to make Tesla for, what was Cathie Wood's latest estimate for Tesla? I think $4,000 per share, $4 trillion. It's no problem. Just use a higher revenue growth, a higher margin and a high sales to capital ratio. So I'm going to talk about how companies have gone crazy with that number. But that basically, if you're doing it right, is an assessment of how big is the market I'm going to have. But your revenues is not the total market, right? It's your market share of that market. And what's going to go into that assessment? You're going to make a judgment of, is my company so much better than the competition? What are the barriers to entry? market for what Airbnb does. You know, the first reaction I get is nobody's ever done what Airbnb does. But is that true? Did you travel before 2008? Did you stay in places and cities you didn't know? Yeah, right. We call those places hotels and they've been around for as long as human beings have been on the face of the earth. So the place I started was with the hotel business. what I did here. And there I described my market as a car service business. It's a much more difficult business to get the total numbers. You know what? Who dominated that business before Uber came along? Taxi cab companies. So I had to actually go city by city, adding up numbers from tax. It was a nightmare. You think, why don't you look it up on Google? Nobody done it before. And I came up with a number of 100 billion, which I think was a pretty Uber is changing the car service business. In what way? That people who are doing, who would not have used a taxi cab, but now using car services. And he was absolutely right. My youngest son for the long time, I think he's still on my credit card when he uses Uber. And there's some Saturday nights I look down at my phone and I see seven Uber charges over the course of two hours. you change behavior. I had to make a judgment on what that change will be. And later when I do my Airbnb valuation, you'll see, now I actually projected that they'd be able to double the size of the market because people who might not have gone to a hotel are now much more likely to go stay in an Airbnb because you're taking your family. It's so expensive to get a hotel. Now you might use an Airbnb instead. before I look for other hotels. So I'm learning something about the business. But then if you think about it, Airbnb is in the hospitality business, but it's not really like a hotel company, right? Hotel companies are constrained because they have physical infrastructure. And Marriott has revenues, and it's the largest hotel company, about $25 billion. So I said, look, I'm going to look at somebody else who's playing in the hospitality business who does something more similar to Airbnb, which acts as an intermediate. business. They get a slice of that. And that's the Airbnb business. They'll have a big gross booking, but their slice is going to be the 14% of whatever they keep. So that was my assessment of a totally addressable market. Now, I told you Silicon Valley has learned to play this game. So if you look at the prospectus for Airbnb, they give their own assessments of what they call the TAP. They don't even expand it because it leaves a mysterious view. travel guide because who knows what this guy is going to put me in and where he's going to take me or she's going to but they you know but they said all this other stuff and they've left it kind of unspecified will take me from 1.5 trillion to 3.4 trillion that's a lot of money one and this is part of the problem is when you make up total addressable markets you can basically make up any number you want when we value uber and talk about my total addressable market which Because as an investor, what do you think? We're doing trillion. This is why when people say, well, Tesla can have $2 trillion in revenue. So what have you been drinking? We can debate how successful Tesla will be. But the largest automobile company is $300 billion. You have $2 trillion. There's something wrong with your story. You say, AI will do it for you. The collective AI business is probably $100 billion. Robots will do it for you. Another $200 billion. 100% market share of both. where essentially they argue that this, they call this the network loop. Basically, as companies get bigger, they're going to get bigger. Basically, that, you know, and the way to think about this is if you want to list your apartment on an intermediary search, let's say there are five competitors to Airbnb. Airbnb is the biggest, and you've got VRBO, and you've got three other no-names. Guess which one you're going to go list it on? You're going to go list it on the biggest one because that's where, so it's almost as you get bigger, 20% of that and then from that 200 billion then you can subtract out expenses. Wouldn't that like contrast Tesla's total municipal market because those two are running in contrast? Well not necessarily right the Tesla advocates would say our automated driving is what's going to so we're going to provide the cars that you can use for automated driving so Uber wants to compete in this car and in this game and use you do it is you have to offer a discount. You got to get them to buy thousands of cars. It's not easy. And in a sense, I'm willing to listen, but these people keep adding a trillion dollars to revenue saying it's automated traffic. I don't quite get how you get there, right? There is no business out there with that much revenue. So that's the first stop, right? So stop, take a second look at margins. I said, left to yourself, you want to use 60, 40, 45%. Even badly run software companies can have 30% margins. A manufacturing company can almost never have 30% operating margins. Why? Because you've got to make a car to sell it. I don't care how efficient you are. In fact, in 2021, which is kind of peak year for Tesla, they had gross margins of about 26%. And people said, hey, that's going to change, right? You're going to start knocking prices down. So the second thing you want to bring in is, am I in a very competitive business? Because there, even though the unit economics are great, you might not get great margins. And finally, you have to think about what kind of business model is my company adopting. Sometimes you rent an Airbnb, 14% of whatever you pay goes to Airbnb. I make the assumption that 14% is going to stay intact. And there again, you might push back and say, maybe if I have competition, the 14% will become 12%. And their margins were actually 35.48% in 2009. Remember, by the time I did this, it was November of 2020, at the peak of COVID, the margins had dropped. So I think the 25% margin, you can push back and say, maybe it should be 30, but it's not going to be 60% margin. They're clearly costs associated. Why are Expedia's margins low? Actually, I was puzzled when I first saw it. You know what Expedia does that Booking.com does not do that pushes down their margins? and plant and equipment, that's going to go in. You'd have to consider whether as you get bigger, that number is going to, you're going to get more. So depending on the business, in some businesses, as you get bigger, you're able to more efficiently deploy the additional capital. Your sales to capital ratio will rise. In some businesses, it might drop. So you can change the sales to capital ratio over time. And my spreadsheet, I allow you three shots at it. What is, what's it going to be next year, near term? What's it going to be between years two and five? What's it going to last forever. And then as that capacity got used up, I shifted to a sales to capital ratio for the industry. So here again, you can look at what's typical for the industry and make your judgment. business, I am assuming that they've hit kind of a steady step. Now, I could be wrong. Maybe they can get more efficient over time in terms of additional capital invested. I don't think so. But in that story, you can raise the sales to capital ratio over time saying they're going to be able to get more efficient of capital deployment. You cannot run away from the business you're in. So if you have a business where big number in every DCF valuation, the big enchilada in every DCF is the terminal value. It's the number where the most mischief is created in valuation. So I want to talk about why we need that number first. First, the value of an asset. So you liquidate Disney and you sell off the Peter Pan ride in pieces. I'm sure the collectors will collect it. Liquidation value. Perfectly okay, right? When is that appropriate? When you have a declining or a dying business, you can say, you know what? At the end of your 10th, there's really going to be no demand for this business. I'm going to liquidate. Liquidation value is okay. You seldom't see why people don't use it more. What you then you will have is a growing annuity for the next 15 years. We know how to compute the present value of it. The fact that people don't use it doesn't mean you cannot do it. And then there's a final approach, which is where 80% of banking, 90% of banking DCFs do, which is you get to your 10. And here's what you do. You take the EBITDA on your 10 and you apply a multiple. Where do you get the multiple? job as a pricing job. I don't even know why they waste their time on DCFs, to be quite honest. I'd be much better. I think we'd all be better off if a banker said, we're going to stop doing DCF. We're just going to do pricing. We're not going to play this game of projecting cash for the next year. We'll use a forward pricing for this company because numbers are not settled in. Much more respect for banking pricing, if that's what you need to do. Go to the term value, hold all its constant, and just change the g and move it towards the r, right? You know where you're going to go. Call these? Interplanetary travel. Okay. Tesla, you said, maybe they'll put the Teslas and SpaceXes and send them off to Mars. Who would buy the cars on Mars? I don't know. But this is a mathematical constraint. It's how to finance a sure economy. I'm not assuming it. The math works against you. I never have. I don't understand this. The reason I don't... Do some companies shrink or... You have a tobacco company. What the heck are you doing putting a 3% growth rate in perpetuity? Wouldn't it be more realistic to put a minus 3% growth rate? What does that do? Your company will peak in year 10 and then it'll shrink over time gradually to become nothing. Also, fuel companies. Declining or dying businesses can open that option. The final point comes there. So I'm going to give you the proxy that I use for my growth rate threat. And here's where I come up with the proxy. Do you really want to be estimating the nominal growth rate in the global economy forever, starting in year 2032? I don expected real growth. I'm going to make a statement that I'll back it up with that, that in the long term, your expected real interest rate and the expected real growth rate have to be close to each other. It might not be exactly. Here's why. If I promise an expected real interest rate of 3% and the economy is growing at only 1%, I'm going to have a problem. Because remember, I have to deliver 3-bond rates are high, nominal growth is high, because the same forces drive more. And here's my other rationale. Even if you don't buy into anything I've said, say you say, I think the risk-free rate is too low, which is what a lot of people said for the last decade. You know what the best thing to do is They were using normal growth rates of the US economy from history, 3%, 4%, 5%. They were using T-bond rates actually as they were, 1%, 1.5%, 2%. And then they were throwing up their hands saying, what's going on? Why am I getting these five values? Because you're making assumptions about the economy that are actually different within your own equation. Your numerator is assuming one type of economy. Your denominator is not. So you can either fix the risk-free rate by making it some kind of a normalized risk-free", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 2.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [2.0, 4.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [4.0, 6.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [6.0, 8.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [8.0, 10.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [10.0, 12.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [12.0, 14.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [14.0, 16.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [16.0, 18.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [18.0, 20.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [20.0, 22.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [22.0, 24.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [24.0, 26.0], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording."}, {"timestamp": [26.0, 151.73], "text": " I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording.
