  "text": " um So if you've got a drug to treat diabetes and a particular drug, you get protection on that drug. You don't get protection against other companies working on their own drugs. And that undercuts the value. The exclusivity, again, starts to fail. So let's pass patents through the test. Is there an option? The contingency is you will develop the patent if and only if the present value of the cash flows from developing the patent exceed the cost of the patent. in the mic that that mic is always live so mic is on i used to can't hear me but with the last session too i had trouble with the mic maybe the mic is gone so which gets too late to fix it for today's class nothing i can do about it but it if you look at can i apply an option pricing model you will develop the reserves and keep the difference. If that's not the case, you will sit on those reserves. An example, classic example of this is Petrobras. Develops millions of barrels of oil in reserve when oil prices were high. Then when oil prices dropped, they had the reserves. They were not viable, but they were still valuable as options just in case oil prices go back up. So if I were to draw a payoff diagram for developing undeveloped reserves, 20 years, that becomes the life of the option. And here again, we need to introduce a cost of delay, right? Because if you have reserves that become viable, part of you says, let's wait, oil prices could go to $150 a barrel. But the other part says, if we don't develop the reserves now, we'll give up the cash flows we can get from developing the reserves. That becomes a cost of delay. But I'm explicitly emphasizing the cost of delay. It's a central theme in real options. you multiply by the oil price today, which you can use for, but it's got to be today's prices. That becomes, yes, much easier than the value of an option, right? We had to do present value of the cash flows. Here there's oil, there's an oil price. You get the value of the reserve. What's the cost of developing the reserve? Well, it depends on where in the world you are. If this is Saudi Arabia, the reserves might cost almost nothing to develop. The oil is so close to the ground. But if it's Canada, standard deviation in oil prices over time, that becomes the variance in values, basically the variance in the oil price. It's an observable. Already you can see why real options have their deepest roots in natural resource companies. Natural resource companies actually use real options in a tangible way because the numbers are easier to get. Each year that you produce from the reserve of the option because you get out there, you're all excited. Oil prices are $80. You develop, you decide to put the order out to develop the reserves. You know what can happen in the two years you wait before the oil comes out of the ground to go back down to $60. Essentially, there's a present value effect that's got to be factored and that's going to lower the value of that oil reserve. So let's, let me try this on a real company. The estimate then was the cost of developing these reserves would be about $10 per barrel. So it'll cost them $30.38 billion if they decide to develop all the reserves right away. So think of that as the strike price. It's what they would have to invest up front to develop these reserves. So I have the K for the model. The value, the price of oil at that time was $22.38 per barrel. And the variable cost of extracting the oil was $7. T-bond rate then was 9%. This is actually not a made-up number. The T-bond rate in 1984 was 9%. So when you have people bitching and moaning about 3.5% rates and how horrific it is and how nobody can live with these rates, people have lived with far higher rates in the past. So let's take this apart. So let's30.38. I get a discounted cash flow valuation of these reserves. That discounted cash flow valuation is $12 billion. And that's where we'd stop with DCF, right? Let's see what optionality does for us here. value that 12 billion with the DCF model becomes 13.3 billion dollars. I mean, this is magical, right? I've taken a DCF value, added 1.3 billion. What is that extra 1.3 billion in value? Or where is it coming from? Can't be time. I'll tell you why. If I take the variance of oil prices and make them zero, what will happen to the value of the reserves. Right now, they're non-viable, but they'll be an option value because... And the more volatile oil prices become, the more careful you've got to be about not giving away undeveloped reserves, even if they're non-viable. I mean, the premium is coming from the fact that as oil prices move, the reserves could go from being low-value reserves to high-value reserves. And if you're in a situation Another implicit assumption we're making here that can also kind of crimp your development of the reserves. As you develop the reserves, you have no effect on oil prices. I take 3.038 billion, demand and supply basically leaves the oil prices where it is. That might be okay if you're a small oil company. But Aramco said, look, we're going to take 300 billion barrels of oil out of the ground right now. reserves, you're underwater. These are non-viable reserves. And there's a problem here because oil companies are required to report reserves, but only viable reserves. So if you look at many oil company 10Ks, there will be a footnote on these are reserves, but they're required to report only viable reserves, which means as oil prices drop, you'll actually see reserves reported drop off. It's not that they have less reserves, but they volatile oil prices are can also affect the value of an oil company. The best case scenario for oil companies is high and volatile. The worst case scenario is low and boring. 1980s and 90s killed oil companies. Oil prices went to $25 a barrel and just stayed there. working all the way through. So finally, I'm going to bring those reserves in to try to value Gulf Oil as a company. Gulf Oil at the time that I looked at this had developed reserves and undeveloped reserves. The developed reserves had about 10 years of cash flows left at $915 million a year. I discounted those reserves the traditional way at on lots of things that are i mean i'm going to argue later today that stock in a publicly traded company is an option option to liquidate right you own the equity so every you have options and options and options and they start to compound over time do it all the time. And you can see that it works for them because the mechanics work out. So any asset that has natural scarcity kind of meets this exclusivity condition. You know that a building in New York has significant optionality. First, the fact that real estate, it's an island, you're under the square footage. You don't want to develop it right now because you don't think you can make the rental income. You can see the option out of you. You're paying for the building and the option to convert that building into a nine-story building. There are options in real estate that often affect the value of a property and how much you're willing to pay for a property. It's not that you plan to develop the property right now, but the right to develop the property becomes that added value that you're willing to pay option. You're going to take it. But if you do, there is this option to expand, right? Right now it looks bad, but here's why it could still have been. Think about the payoff diagram. You could spend the additional money to expand. When would you do it? Only if you believe the present value of the cash flows from expanding are greater than the cost of expansion. So you take the first bad project saying, They don't use that language, but they're using an options argument. So let's see when that argument makes sense and when it doesn't. And I'll use a very simplistic valuation to illustrate how this can add value to your DCF. Let's say you value a company. It's an antivirus software company. You do the expected free cash flow, cost of capital. You come up with $115 million. It's a small company. $115 million. You're done. The DCF value is done. present value, you can see this is not looking like a great business, right? You invest a half a billion upfront, you make 40 million every year for the next 10 years. You don't even have to do any present value. You're already underwater. By the way, it is a risky business. So the cost of capital is 12%. Let's assume that there is substantial uncertainty about how the database business will evolve. So 50% standard deviation. 50 percent in value the call option i get with those absolutely horrendous inputs for snk of 56 million dollars I know I'm Lime, I rent out bikes, I know the business is never going to work out, but I'm collecting data on my users and I might be able to come up with a new business that I can use the data on. The only problem is the kind of data Lime collects on users is primarily location data. It's not preference data, which a hundred other companies have. You can very quickly see the options arguments start to dissipate if you test them on exclusivity. expansion option. So the next time you hear somebody using a strategic argument, push them on the exclusivity component. Because if you fight them on the strategic domain, you will always lose. Because big thinkers always look like, hey, you know, I have vision, you don't. This has nothing to do with vision. It's about the fact that I agree with you, AI is a big market. But why this product? What is the exclusivity that comes with it? Because without the exclusivity value, the Not really. There is no business. The database business doesn't exist. The business doesn't exist. The option of the business doesn't exist. Again, it's very much like patents. I am using an option pricing model where neither replication nor arbitrage is that easy to do. The way this is going to play out in your valuation. I'll tell you how it played out in my value, in one of my valuations. advertising company. It has 3 billion users in its ecosystem. Right now, all it does is sell them advertising. Is it collecting exclusive data on its users? God, is it collecting data that you don't even want to know what they know about you? It's at the heart of the problem with Facebook, right? When you say privacy, it's basically saying they're collecting data about me that I don't want them to know. My you're going to get in coca-cola what are they going to do come up with a beverage that makes you thinner don't ask me that's a risky thing to even throw out there it's there's not much upside left kind of physical activity, how much you do, and whether you're regular about the activity or not. And if they chose to use it, they could. I mean, think of Weight Watchers, right? It's been around forever. Recently, they bought a drug that's been approved by the FDA. Terminal value does. Your growth rate might, it depends on what went into your growth rate. The growth rate I used was an online advertising growth rate. Remember you said the total addressable market, market share. So unless you've somehow set a total addressable market that includes two other potential businesses, in which case you're right, there's double counting. So since you control what you did in your DCF, you know what you've already counted. right now do you think tesla bulls are making an options argument for tesla do you read the art thing that came out last week it was the most outlandish piece of i don't want to call it research it was about automated driving and i looked at the number and i said i'm not sure where this number is coming from but you're making an options argument value, right? As long as the price is less than the value, I'm getting a bargain. My value doesn't include any of this. So I'm going to add the option value. I have no idea what's in the price, to be quite honest. It doesn't matter, right? In a sense, let's say it does reflect options. You know how it's going to show up? The price is going to be $250 per share. I'm going to say, look, I'm not going to buy Facebook and I'm going to move on. If it overestimates the value of the options. So we have no idea what the price includes the option to abandon it's the only real option that's a put option it gives you the right to walk away from an investment you've already made and here's how it plays out you have an investment i give you the option to walk away if you walk away you get let's say half of what you invest so you're gonna you know you're gonna lose money but essentially i cap your loss so i've so basically i put a limit on your downside 500 million for and you calculate the cash flows and you come up with the present value cash flows of 480 million. I said, no, we're not interested. Why? Because you're asking me for 500 million, it's worth only 480 million. So I offer you an add-on. I said, look, I know the net present value is minus 20 million, but if you invest you have the right any time over the next five years to walk away from the joint venture. So let's value the put. The present value of the cash flows is 480 million. The strike price is 400 million. But remember, this is a put. It's an out-of-the-money option because who would exercise today? Why walk away with 400 million? But any time over the next five years, if the present value drops below 400 million, are, I compute that 130th each year that I wait that the cost. So that becomes the dividend yield and here it's going to push up the value of the option. I plug the numbers in. I come up with the value for the put option of 73.23 million. Getting the right to be able to walk away anytime over the next five years on this project is worth 73 million. What is the NPV? Minus 20 million. but it still limits your losses to whatever that amount is. Here are the implications for investing. First, having an option to abandon a project is always good. But you have to work at creating it. So in terms of when you put together long projects, here are some of the things you might consider. Having shorter-term contracts, even though they might cost you more than longer-term contracts. The rule you're always given is, if you have a 30-year project, Airbus will want a 30-year option, but I can't afford to do that. If I did that, I'd wipe myself up. So this is not just about increasing the value of the option to abandon because somebody has to pay for it here. In this case, that's okay. So in terms of implication, just means building in more flexibility into your projects in terms of taking them over multiple stages rather than all at one sacks reputation right which is they all well it might be because a goldman sacks guy was always at the top of the treasury but it might also have been that they had the capacity to walk away from mistakes a little sooner than everybody else that's an options argument for flexibility and you could argue that companies that have more flexibility when you do a dcf model should have that premium built into that because even though you because that excess debt capacity is going to come into play in case we get a once in a lifetime project coming at us two years from now for you we don't see it yet but could come at any time that's the key here is something unexpected shows up great project might never show up? Yeah. In which case, what have you lost? By being under levered, you had a much higher cost to capital than you did, and that becomes the cost there. So actually, you know what, you can actually try to value this flexibility, but more interesting than putting a value to flexibility is actually thinking about the implications. So that becomes the S in the model. The K in the model becomes how much you can raise as capital from within. So right now, what they require is reinvestments, about 5.3% of value. What they can come up with as cash flows is 4.8%, but there's uncertainty about that reinvestment. Coming from where right thing for them to do and what kinds of companies should be forced towards their optimal",
