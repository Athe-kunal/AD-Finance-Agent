  "text": " okay E a\u00ed exactly what I'm going to be doing Monday night and Tuesday. And it's not going to be returning valuation. So I would like to get this out of the way before that load comes in. So do I look like I'm wearing sunglasses? I just want to make sure I made the mistake of picking the wrong pair of glasses up when I was in California last weekend. And this is the one that automatically turns governance. And let's say that the company is also badly managed. Remember, if you have bad corporate governance and you're well managed, you don't care, right? Bad corporate governance and badly managed when you care. Let's say it's badly managed. And when you do your cash flows, you bring in the fact that it's badly managed and badly run. You come up with a value of $100 million. your growth ceases to matter, right? Your return on capital is higher than the cost of capital. Growth increases value. Can you have a company that in terminal value earns a return on capital less than the cost of capital? Yes, in which case you will get a terminal value that's lower than your book value. And if you could change the way the companies run, you would, but with terrible corporate governance because it's a family controlled company or the insiders own shares, you might have nothing you can do. So we're going to talk about where, is just badly run and there's nothing I can do to change it. Next question. The other thing we're going to do today is we're going to value distress companies. Now, of course, the class is on distress, but they focus on the bonds and distress, right? Let's say you're investing in the equity of a distress company. And you learned every lesson that you need to learn about projecting cash flows. So you make realistic assumptions about the expected cash flows. You take bed, bath and beyond. will the value you get from a discounted cash flow valuation for a distressed company get the value right maybe it's already in there like it was for corporate governance will it be too low or too high anybody want to give that a shot and tell me why what is it about discounted because we did everything we're doing rational right what is it that's the discounted cash flow valuation is not capturing They'd be at 15, 16, 18, 20. They're blunt instruments. They were never designed to capture this kind of risk. So today we're going to talk about how you estimate that failure risk at distressed companies. And it's easier to do than with startups. We have the ammunition to do it. And then you have to ask a follow-up question. What exactly will my equity be worth if that happens? So both big questions, because there are questions I think we deal with badly in intrinsic valuation, was never supposed to go into recession again, was in a recession. Risk premiums had risen. The world had changed. So I revisited my valuation of Amazon in 2001. And I got more pessimistic. That story I told became a little smaller because I said the pathway to glory is not going to be as easy explain what i mean by trapped remember a year ago after i finished the valuation what do you ask me are you selling short and then at this little song and dance about time horizon and i can't do it and you let me escape now i'm trapped because now what's the Every investment in my portfolio, I have to do a maintenance valuation at least once a year. Sometimes more because if something big happens, I've got to go back and revisit it. I did my maintenance valuation in 2002. My value actually increased significantly over the course of the year because the immediate threat of failure had gone away. My value went up. The price also went up, but the stock stayed undervalued. Basically, Amazon has earned the right to stay in my portfolio the next year. And right now, when you finish your valuation, you might say, I think this stock is overvalued today. I would not buy it today. But don't follow up and say, I'll never buy the stock. Because who knows what the next year will bring and where that price will be a year from now. So my Amazon valuations, I've done pretty much every year from 1997 through 2022. My I missed was they got a second wind after. It's almost like they were moving towards steady state as a large retail company. And they said, you know what, that's not what we want to be. I'll talk about the story shift in Amazon.ations of Amazon, I stopped in my story describing it as an online retail company. I described it as a disruption platform because that's what they started doing in 2010. disruption platform, it could be everything. Your upside is you could have $2 trillion in revenues if you're in 10 different businesses. That's the upside. The downside is it's a lot of distraction along the way, right? walmart amazon lives in walmart's head i don't think there's even walmart in walmart's head it's all about what would amazon do we've got to do it differently or do it the same so clearly walmart it dominates it what about fedex you think fedex thinks about amazon okay if you think about logistics business clearly amazon's footprint is almost as big Chase Bank in New Jersey to a JPMorgan Chase Bank. I'm moving my money, the same bank from one branch to another branch. It should be effortless, right? They charged me a $45 fee. And I said, what exactly did you do? Take all the cash out of my account, put it on the back of somebody, make them walk across the country. It's Amazon enters a business, here's one thing we don't know, whether they'll ever make money. But here's the other thing we know. That business is going to be less profitable from this day on. The day that Amazon bought Whole Foods, the collective market cap of grocery stores dropped by $50 billion. model. Throw 100 new shows up every day. 95 of them are unwatchable. I was in a podcast yesterday, and the person, for whatever reason, asked me what I was watching on streaming. And I said, the one thing I've stopped doing is looking for something on Netflix, because I have more false starts on Netflix than on any other streaming. You know what a false start? You start a show, and 10 minutes in, you say, I don't have the time in my life to waste on this. there'd be at least 50 for me to be interested. Hamster on a wheel. So I want you to think whatever story you're telling for a company, think about a character from a movie or a character from a cartoon and say, you know, that's, you know, the roadrunner is what I see whenever I see this company. If you've never seen the roadrunner, you should see Wile E. Coyote in the roadrunner. Maybe Wile E. Coyote is what you see. It's off a cliff smash at the bottom over and over again. Maybe that's Credit Suisse right there. you a follow-up question. Can you get set in ways that are not good for you? Forget about companies. Do you do things every day? I should not do that, but you're so used to doing that that you keep doing it. Companies get into bad habits. So you can have mature companies that are doing things that shouldn't be doing. It's creating value destruction. And finally, somebody draws their attention to it. You shouldn't be doing it. And with the changes where you sell off three businesses, you might get a different number. And I ask you, what's your value from future growth? With the status quo, you get one set of answers and one value. But with somebody else running the company or a different way of running the company, you might get a lower reinvestment rate and a higher return on capital or a higher reinvestment rate and lower return on capital, depending on what you think is a better way of doing it. value the company more than once. So I'm going to give you an example. It's a company that some of you might have heard of, but even if you haven't heard of the company, you probably have heard of the most famous product. It's a company called Hormel Foods. It's an old company. It's been around a long time. And it produces a product that I think is the single most odious thing I've ever seen sold as a food product. It's called Spam. What's between Japan and the U.S.? What's right in the middle there? Lots of ocean, but there's Hawaii. So they landed in Hawaii. And this is not the Hawaii of today with five-star hotels. This is the Hawaii of 1945. You have tens of thousands of hungry soldiers landing. They don't want pineapple to eat. They want meat. So the U.S. Army puts out a requisition. We want meat. It's so old, the family's kind of moved on. And now it's run by managers. But it's run conservatively. What's that? The company refuses to borrow money. It borrows very little. Why? Because they don't like to borrow money. They think the world ends on the US coast. Basically, they don't believe the rest of the world exists. There are no global dreams. So they reinvest more, let's say 40% of their after-tax operating income, that reinvestment rate, a higher reinvestment rate. I'm going to be realistic. This might mean taking projects with lower returns than they used to, and I'm okay with it. It's still higher than the cost of capital. So the 2.75% growth becomes a 5.6% growth rate. So I'm not, again, making them into a high growth company, in I'm an investor I can buy only at one price I said the stock price is 34 right now he said what do I do 38 is higher than 34 32 is lower well both the status quo and the changes can't coexist there's got to be a probability of one happening or the other happening so I try know who the head of the Hormel Foundation was? The CEO of Hormel. Now, this is going to make my life a lot more difficult to get change going. So I got realistic. I said, look, there's no 50% chance of change. It's probably going to be 10%. Why even 10%? Next week's valuation of the week, even though you might not be looking at it, take a look at it, is going to be a valuation of EasyJet that I did in 2019. EasyJet, of course, is a UK discount airline whose revenues come from flying people to holiday destinations in Europe. You think so what? 2009 was peak uncertainty about Brexit. valuation, do two valuations and deal with the probabilities of each one happening later. So mature companies, for the most part, are easy to value, but that doesn't mean they're a slam dunk. So let me talk a little bit about debt ratios, because, you know, as you can see, the, you know, I used a higher debt ratio. And of course, you know, when you talk to analysts, they always seem to believe that using more debt will always lower your cost of capital. Intuitively, you can see why, right? You're an equity investor in a company, and I double my debt. I made your equity earnings more risky, and you should demand a higher cost of equity. And we actually created a mechanism to do that, right? So when we talked about betas, rather than take a regression beta, what did I say we should do? Take a bottom-up beta, lever it up using your debt-to-equity ratio. So what you see here is my beta for formal foods at different debt ratios from 0% to 90% debt. going to estimate it. Remember how we estimated the cost of debt for companies without ratings? What's the ratio we used? Interest coverage ratio, operating income divided by interest expense. So here's what I do. At every debt ratio, I compute your interest expense and compute an interest coverage ratio. Not rocket science, but as my interest coverage ratio changes, I compute a synthetic rating. And guess what? As Hormel Foods ceaps borrowing money, its rating is going to think of debt as a double-edged sword. The sharp edge is now towards you, and you can see the cost of capital start to go up. On a pure optimization basis, the cost of capital that will maximize the value of formal foods is about 30% debt. You're saying, why do you stop at 20? If you're going to make a mistake, it's better to undershoot than to overshoot on leverage. I've kind of given them a buffer here. So they can't accuse me of pushing them beyond the limit. let's talk about the most depressing part of the life cycle. Let's talk about declining companies. Part of the reason we have trouble with declining companies is psychological. And I'll explain what I mean by that. It takes a frame of mind that most of us don't feel comfortable adopting. Part of it comes with all the pain that comes with decline. But what does decline mean? When I look at your past, when I ask you, what are your cash flows from existing assets? And you show me your history. If it's a declining company, almost asking to go bankrupt, right? Because the debt is still there. If you take that cash and pay down debt, maybe you could become a safer and smaller company. And finally, when I ask you, when will the good times begin in a sense this is a question i ask for almost every dcf audience i have people who do valuation every day they've done it for 40 years you know how many people negative revenue growth rate, it's okay. You're valueing a tobacco company. You know what? Negative revenue growth rate might be the best estimate to put for the company. Doesn't make it a bad company or a bad investment. It just means your core business is shrinking. Fossil fuel companies, especially if you believe that climate change is going to bring significant change to the business, you value ExxonMobil, a minus 3% growth rate might not be a bad assumption. Marissa Meyer spent $5 billion trying to make people use Yahoo again. $5 billion that went down the drain. But it's not her fault. She was given this mission, rescue the company. Sometimes when you value a declining company, you got to look at who's on top of the company. And if it's a person with a lot of ambition, you don't want a visionary running a declining company. Trust me. I mean, that's a recipe for, you don't want Steve Jobs running Bed Bath & Beyond. Maybe I can live in reflected glory. So JCPenney had hired the guy in charge of Apple stores and Apple stores succeeded coming to JCPenney and make us shiny and valuable again. I took one look and said, have you ever been to a JCPenney store? How do you make this shiny and valuable, right? You can make it less unattractive and perhaps somebody might even come in. So when I valued the company, I was distinct. I thought I was being, this was an optimistic valuation of the company. company, making it smaller. And while it's shrinking, see this reinvestment number? It's negative. You're saying, what does that mean? You're shutting stores down, you're getting out of leases, and the lessors are actually paying you to leave. So rather than putting money into the business, you're taking money out of the business. Your invested capital shrinks, the company shrinks, you're basically making your company smaller. The optimistic side here is when you get to year 10, I'm assuming they've hit some steady state, at the value that i'm getting it's half of what my fair value is the value that i get for the operating assets is a weighted average of what i get for, estimate the probability of failure is to look at the bond rating and trust the ratings agencies. And basically the way you trust the ratings agencies, you go back in history and say, if I have a BB rating, what is the likelihood that the company will fail given the history of BB rated bonds? And that gives them, I think, an advantage when it comes to things like distress, because they're going to look at, will my interest payments get made? So I'm going to use the bond price to back it out. And if you have neither a rating or a bond price, I'm going to suggest a statistical technique that you might be able to use to estimate a probability of default. So here's the company I'm going to use as my example. It's a company called Las Vegas Sands. Heard of it? Las Vegas Sands was one of the fastest growing casino companies between 2000 and 2007. They built casinos in Vegas, casinos in Macau. In Singapore, there is this gigantic hotel that's shaped like a ship. So it's all uncommon. Casino companies do this all the time. Almost entirely dead. Why? Because when you own 52 percent of the shares, you're terrified that if you issue shares to build these casinos, you'd lose control. So they borrowed money, they built a casino version of how you fix a trouble company. Maybe it's in my own textbook, but still a textbook version. What do you do to fix a trouble company? You bring the revenues back, you improve the margins, you lower the debt ratio, all in a spreadsheet. value of the company if it makes it as a going concern. What am I concerned about? That might not be the case. So I wanted to estimate the likelihood of failure, and I'll show you how I use the bond price. Las Vegas Sands had bonds outstanding. It had a seven-year bond outstanding. It was rated B+, so I could have used the rating to the probability that the company will fail. Of course, right now, I don't know what that number is. And because I've adjusted the coupons for the likelihood that I will get paid, guess what? I discount those coupons back. I discount those expected coupons back at the risk rate. So basically, instead of taking the promised coupons and discounting them back at a risk-adjusted rate, I'm making the promised coupons into expected coupons. Trust me, it's going somewhere. So I have the price of the bond, that my company will be a going concern. It's worth $8.12. The remaining 77% of the time, tell me what's going to happen. It's going to falter on its bonds, fail to pay, and then it's got to sell the casinos. To whom? Other casino companies are equally in trouble. They don't have the money to do it. You're not going to get face value. And then you're going to pay off all the debt. There's zero chance my equity is ever coming back to me if that happens. So my equity is going to be worth zero. So I have two values. companies as options and why you might do it. Here you're still treating it as a going concern and say, what's that equity worth? Any questions on distressed companies? Yes. There's a risk of failure. So the first part of what you said, what do you say get property of failure in year one, in year two, in year three, and attach that to each year's cash flow. And that'll give me a more refined value if I wanted to, because I am doing a bludgeon approach here. We're taking expected value, failure rate today, what's my equity worth? But you could actually carry it out over time. Yes? And it is, but when you do the market value of debt using the default risk, ignore it. In 1970s, 1980s, that might have been true with the kinds of companies being valued, but if you're starting to value distressed companies and companies with chance of failure is high. I would do it only for companies which were below investment grade. I don't want to do this with triple B, single A, because the chance of failure is small enough that I can bring it in somewhere. But as the failure risk gets higher financial statements, you might have less faith in the cash flows you get for a Chinese company and saying, I don't know how they're pretty opaque. They have cross holdings. And I ask you, what's the value of growth? The same opacity will get in the way. If they have holding structures, you can't see where they're investing, what they're investing. It becomes more difficult. Every question, in a sense, using the same techniques, but you're working with data that you feel less secure about. And to top it all off, of course, bludgeoned to beat up every company in an emerging market, we ask the question, where does this company get its revenue? The implication is you can have an emerging market company like Infosys or Tata Consulting Services or Embraer, which is in an emerging market, but gets a bulk of its revenues in developed markets. Or you can have a developed market company like Coca-Cola, which gets a big chunk of its revenues from emerging markets. The answer is, for the most part, no. And here's why. Currency risk is real, right? But there are two dimensions. One is when people talk about currency risk, they're talking about, first, devaluation in currencies. And you've got to separate out expected from unexpected. When you think about how we adjusted for inflation, you have a country with a 9% inflation rate, another country with a 2% inflation rate. Let's that risk for the most part should be diversifiable risk. A BlackRock or a State Street or a Vanguard, which as an international fund shouldn't even be thinking about currency risk at the broad perspective, because when the dollar is strengthened, some of the companies are going to benefit, some are going to be hurt. So for the most part, be ready? First thing is, I mean, risk-free rent for 5% to 2%. So let's start with the good news. When I use US dollars, I have a lower cost of capital for Infosys than I do in rupees. Why? Not because of country risk. That's in both discount rates, but because I've moved from a high-inflation currency to a low-inflation currency. Lower discount rate is good, right? And a discounted cash flow valuation. But I'm not done. See these growth rates? good news. I don't know if any of you are valuing a Russian company, you're valuing a company in Turkey, and you're saying, I'm getting tired of carrying a 25% inflation rate through time. This basically says, go pick a different currency, do everything in that currency, and as long as you're consistent, the value per share you get should be the same in every currency. So it gives you an out when you're dealing with a currency with extremely high inflation. Because high inflation currencies are a of came up with the answer. If you're doing the valuation, you control how you estimate cash flows and discount rates. You have a mechanism you can use to bring in the effect of bad corporate governance. So I'm going to use an example. This is a company called Tube Investments. It's a South Indian publicly traded company and a company that I've known all my life because it's a company where I remember the owners of the company coming to 12% were huge amounts of reinvestment, entering new projects, new businesses. You think this is good? In fact, the return on capital was about 9.2%. That doesn't sound bad, right? But this was in India where the risk-free rate was 12%. So they're growing and they're reinvesting, but they're growing and reinvesting in bad businesses. and creating values. The other half, they were growing, but they were growing badly and destroying value. But I left them doing that because there was zero chance of change in this company. What does that do? If you keep growing at, let's say in this case, I assume the growth rate of 5% a year forever, and you keep reinvesting at 9.2% and with your cost of capital is 15, 16%, you're going to grow and you're going to get a terminal value. But the terminal value is actually lower than it would have been 150%. Now, I actually used the 60%. They said, why didn't you make it 112% like it was last year? The value per share went to 45. And after about the second or third try of increasing the reinvestment rate, they realized it wasn't happening. If you want to increase value here, that's the first thing you need to fix. You either need to increase the return on capital on new investments. You say, what if I can't the return on capital from 9.2 to 12.2%. It's unrealistic to expect to go to 16.2%. That brings your value to about 100 rupees per share. If you can move the return all the way to 16%, it goes up to 150 rupees per share. Have less focus on growing and more focus on the quality of that growth. Because that's really what's driving value. Many mature companies with bad corporate governance, that's what you worry about. And whether you like it or not, a chunk of the value comes from the cross-holdings. So again, staying with an Indian example, I had to value four Tata companies for the Tata Group, one of India's oldest family groups. And I valued the companies. I did an intrinsic valuation. That's what you see in the blue part of the asset. That's my discounted cash flow value, free cash flow from the firm discounted back at the cost of capital. But then I had to adjust for to accumulate these crossholdings. But this red part is what makes me incredibly uncomfortable because I'm not sure what the value is. The blue part, I can say, did I get the cash flows right? Did I get the risk right? But that red part is going to always be messy to deal with. exposed to it. It could be natural disasters. You invest in a company in the Caribbean, it's again a tourism-based company. One big hurricane goes through, there goes your entire business model. And finally, of course, if you're in a part of the world where the government gets pissed off at you, they just take you over. These are all truncation risks. And what should you do with them? Exactly what you do with the failure risk. Assess the likelihood of it happening and then ask, what will I get if that happens and take an expected value so i'm going to give an example of how truncation risk plays out in valuation using a ramco and this is of course one of the valuations the week that you had in case you did see that valuation the week you forget the repetition but when i valued around initially i valued as an oil business in fact it's one of the few valuations where i used to finite life to value7 billion. But it's a traditional valuation, right? You take expected cash flows, you discount back at a risk-adjusted discount rate. But when you buy Aramco, you're not buying a typical company. In fact, I don't even know whether you're buying a company. You're buying a country, right? It's Saudi Arabia Inc. It's 80% of Saudi Arabia's GDP comes from Aramco. You're buying a country. And it's not just a country. You're buying a ruling family. You're buying into the House of Saud. you know, from a dictatorship to, you know, to complete change, you could have, you know, the same thing happen in Saudi Arabia, it's 20%. So what would happen if there's a regime change? Depends on who's the new regime is, if it's ISIS, who knows what Saudi or what Aramco could become. But most cases, you're not going to kill the other with the other, and take the expected value across the two. And I think it's a more realistic way of dealing with this kind of risk. You need to at least get started on valuing banks. I think I told you that pre-2008, I used to start my banking chapter with a statement that I've never been able to live down. Valuing banks is easy. the bank. How do we get cash flows? We start with earnings, we add depreciation, we subtract capex and subtract change. Try doing that for a bank, you're very quickly going to go up. Banks are opaque. We make a Faustian bargain when we invest in banks. The bargain is that we don't know much about a bank when we invest in it, but we're okay with it because somebody else is watching What does that mean? As your growth rate decreases, your payout ratio should go up. So you're again staying with the same principles, but using the payout ratio as your metric. So the valuation of an Egyptian bank called CIB, done entirely in Egyptian pounds. And of course, the key number which I had trouble with the most was getting a risk-free rate in Egyptian pounds. I don't know whether you remember it. The way I got this risk-free rate is really high. So the discount rate reflects it. My growth rate over time, I follow the same principles I do with any company, decreases down to a stable growth rate of 10% a year forever. If I said I'm going to use a growth rate in perpetuity of 10% a year forever, if this were US dollars, you'd call me crazy. That can't be. So it's an impossible valuation. But when your inflation rate is 10% or 11%, you can live with the 10% growth rate forever. It's less than the risk-free rate. That's the nice thing about using the risk-free rate. But this is a high inflation economy and dividend discount models are, because of their ease, you can use them around the world. But implicitly, you are trusting the bank to pay out what it can afford to pay out. So next session, after the quiz, and I want to remind you, first 30 minutes of quiz, we're going to talk about how to value banks when you don't trust the managers of the bank to pay out what they can afford.",
