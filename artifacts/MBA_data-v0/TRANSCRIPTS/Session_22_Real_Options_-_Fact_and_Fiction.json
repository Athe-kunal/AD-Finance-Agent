{"text": " Recording in progress. I went to a baseball game and I was like, no. I was like, I should do this for you. So I went to the baseball game and I was like, no. I was like, no. I was like, no. I was like, no. I was like, no. I was like, no. I was like, no. I was like, no. I was like, no. I was like, no. I was like, no. I was like to share. And she was very sharing. So I did go to the baseball game, but I don't scream at baseball games because I know I need my voice the next day. But I wanted to start this class by finishing up the very last piece of packet two. But rather than go to packet two, I was going to make it capital to keep this company going. You're completely undiversified, you're going to be locked into the company. So let's say that the beta for the business you're in is one and the correlation the typical companies, let's say your software company, the unlevered beta is one, your correlation, the correlation of a typical software company in the market is 0.25. So let's say the correlation with the market that you get for the software group as a whole or the venture capital, where the venture capital is 0.5. Same company, same unlevered beta, but now the marginal investor is walking in and their beta that they would see will not be the four that the founder did or the fact that it's your money tied up. Then it's 14% for the next three years because the venture capitalist is accepting a lower cost of equity. They're now the marginal investors. And then you go public, it's the diversified investor, their beta is lower correct cumulative cost of equity, the value of the firm that I get is 1.5 million or 1.5 billion depending on how much you want to scale it down. You're saying, couldn't I have just used the present value function? How different would my answer have been? If you use the cost of equity that basically did not, you didn't use a cumulative cost of equity, use the present value function, the value that you would get here would to pay, right? What if the VCs who enter in in year three are more diversified than I thought they were? It's again going to reduce the diversification. Consequences, discounted or applied. There was much talk about the grey market that was created in the last decade by public market investors entering the VC space. The T-Row prices, the Fidelity's coming in and acquiring stakes of Uber and other young Excuse me. Same value that it would have got as a public company, which is one reason if you look at companies going public now, they're older by almost a decade than companies that went public 30 years ago. Typically, companies used to go public four, five, six years into their lives. Now they wait until they're 13, 14, 15 years because you can afford to wait. The costs of waiting have become smaller. I know you understand the black shows, the binomial, all that stuff, but I will assume you remember nothing. So I'm going to take you through about a 30-minute review of basic option pricing. Because to talk about real options without talking about the basics of option pricing is introducing a tool that requires some understanding before use. So let's start by looking at the basis for why real options have become such a hot topic in corporate finance and valuation. So today I want to give you some questions you can ask to decide when it makes sense to use the optionality argument and when it doesn't. But here's what the optionality argument at its core looks at. It looks at the fact that when you do a traditional investment analysis evaluation, here's what you do. You take the information you have today. You estimate expected cash flows. You discount them back at a risk-adjusted discount rate based on what you know today. That's all I can ask you to do, right? the entree to talk about why a non-viable technology might be valued. So let's say I come to you with this great AI technology, extraordinarily expensive right now, doesn't make sense to develop it. My guess is I'll have people buying the technology from me because if they can make the right changes, it could be an incredibly lucrative technology. It's your option to delay. The second option from those investments if things are going wrong early in its life. So let's say it's a 50 year investment, but you're able to walk away in year 3 or 4 or 5 even with a fraction of what you originally invested. Might be something that might be of value to you because you're not stuck with this investment for the next 45 years. It's this got to do with the previous example? If you look at the total losses, I have minus 120 and the total upside plus 100, it looks very similar in terms of upside and downside. If you take the cumulative probabilities of success and failure, the outcome and then I say, look, if I get a bad outcome on that first test, I stop and if I get a good outcome, I continue. At the core of the real options argument are two components. One is that you get to observe something out there that tells you whether your project is going to be successful and then you adapt your behavior based on what you've observed. One of the things we're going to talk about today is you're missing in a traditional discounted cash flow model, is you get to observe something and change your behavior based on that, and that's what drives that extra premium you're willing to pay. So as I said, it's a very dangerous door we've opened because we've in a sense taken a first principle, in my corporate finance class in the capital budgeting section we talked about net talk about what is it that makes for an option. Second, when does an option have significant economic value because if it doesn't then we're talking about something that's abstract. If it's worth two cents who cares? If it's worth two billion obviously I care. We'll talk about what is it that drives the value of an option. And third, when does that, when can I estimate that value using an option pricing model. So let's start with this, of course, pays out is in that picture that basically sets options apart from every other asset out there, which is the payoff diagram. I showed it to you earlier in the class, but might as well show it again. The essence of options is you get limited downside because it's a right, as options, undeveloped oil reserves as options, is with each one I'm going to show you the payoff diagram that I have. I'm going to tell you what my underlying asset is and what that contingency is. The contingency is where you get that, where you get the graph turning. That drives the optionality. So that's the first step, is to make sure that what you're looking at is in fact an option. Second step, does this option have significant economic But when we talk about real options, this becomes a very critical question to ask because in my view, a lot of people mistake opportunities for options. Yes? Does that have implications on the industry that we're working in? That's options. It depends on the industry for a couple of reasons. One is, in some industries, first movers might have such an advantage that once you move here, it becomes impossible for somebody else to come in. So in those industries, you could argue, there is an optionality. conclusively what drives the value of an option. I can say it. We don't know conclusively what drives the value of a stock. There are too many variables we don't know. But with options we know conclusively. Why? Because options are leeches. They derive their value from something else. The value of an option is determined by six variables. And let me list out the six. Three relate to the underlying asset. The first is the value of the underlying asset the more valuable all our options become on it. Third, any expected dividends that that matters, the dividends in the asset matters. You turn to the option itself, there are two characteristics of the option that drive it value. First is the strike price and you can see why. I said a call gives you the right to buy something at a fixed price. Would you like that right at a lower price or a higher price? The lower the price, the more valuable the option, right? So if I give you the right to buy something at $10, it's worth more than the right to when you have riskless rates go up, the value of call options will tend to increase because that exercise price in today's terms becomes less onerous, incredibly complicated. So it looked like you were valuing a stock, every single outcome take an expected value. In 1971 Fisher, Black and Marin-Scholes kind of revolutionized option pricing by noting something which I think at that point in time had not been clarified, which is you can create something exactly like an option. You say, what do you mean? You take an option that has expected cash flows, each other, there's no risk of cash flows in the future can take option pricing models, you can come up with the value for a real option, but you can have a far less confidence in that number than you do with listed options because you cannot replicate the option and you cannot do arbitrage. So with that, with with those concerns, let's very quickly this replicating portfolio. And the easiest way to see this is actually by using what's called a binomial model. A binomial model comes with limits, which is at any point in time, your price can go to only one or two curves. So let's take a stock. It's trading at $50 right now. In the next time period, it can either go to 70 or 35. At t equal to one, the stock goes to 100, are you going to exercise your right? Yeah. I hope so. And then you keep the $60 difference. So your cash flow is going to be 60. If it goes to 50, again, you're going to exercise your right. You're going to keep that. If it goes to 25, then the option, you're going to put it in the trash cans. I wish I hadn't done that. But you're not going to get zero. So you're going to get zero. Now, of course, your pay is still there. But let's look at this in gross cash flows. that the stock price is 70 and whatever I borrow, the net cash flow has to be 60 if the stock price goes to 100. If the stock price goes to 50, I want 50 times D minus 1.11 times B with 11% of the interest rate to be 10. So essentially what I've done is I've taken D and B there, unknowns I know for the moment. I'm giving you the interest rates that I want those to be set in a way that I get exactly the same cash flow as before. So I've created a replicating portfolio, at least for the moment, with the stock of 70. It's going to be composed of borrowing $36 and buying one share of stock. If the stock goes to 35, I repeat the process. 50 times D minus 1.11 times B has to be equal to 10. 25 times D minus 1.11 B is equal to zero. I solve for D and B, and here's what I get. I borrow $9.01, and I buy. up with $4.99 stroke of the 50. In other words, I'm telling you what the value of the call has to be at those points in time to give you exactly the same cash flows as the. Now let's go back to zero. You can already see why with the binomial model you better start with the very end of the tree and work backwards. Because the very end of the tree is the only time you know exactly what your cash flows are so you work one period back. portfolio today but it's going to cover all of my needs for the rest of the trip, which is stock goes to 70, I'm fully covered, the stock goes to 35, I'm fully covered. I've essentially created a replicating portfolio. The value of the call that I get from that is $19.42. Replicating portfolios, that's what I computed arbitrarily. I'm assuming that they have the same cash flow but the value is the same. The binomial model was one minute time intervals for a three month option. Already making me dizzy just thinking about that tree, right? First you have to get a really sharp pencil, a really big paper, and start drawing tiny little graphs. So you have that kind of patience. You want a normal distribution. You take the binomial model, and as you make time really short, in this case a minute, second, you keep price changes continuous. Basically that means the price has to move in tiny little increments. The binomial distribution converges on the normal distribution. So what you end up with is a normal distribution without all of the work of having to specify those individual price numbers So if you look at the Black-Scholes model, the Black-Scholes model is a limiting case of the binomial model if you assume that as price change or time becomes short, the price changes become continuous. So the original Black-Scholes model is 1971. It took Fisher, Black variance in the value, the life of the option, dividends. Dividends, there are no dividends anymore. You want to know the honest reason why? Because dividends were so messy to build in mathematically and that finally Black and Scholes threw up their hands and said, you know what, we're going to assume away dividends. So keep that in mind when I show you the Black-Scholes model. And remember, all the question marks have sigmas, so don't put any question marks in your final exams. Professor? This is the original Black-Scholes model. Professor? Yes? Am I not sharing the slides with you? We're not hearing you very well or seeing the slides online. Let's see. Let me try that is. It's a cumulative area under the normal distribution. Minus K, which is the strike price, E minus RT. Notice how the black shows makes you use all those buttons and you can't really never touch that natural log, that credentials. What's E minus RT? What's it doing? He said, what's D1 and D2? D1 and D2 are a function of all of those variables. We talked about SK, RT, and that's what took them two years to get to. All of those is to get that D1 and D2, but they built in the effect of all of the variables. At least this is all I'm driving the option. Now, as you look at this, you're saying, where's the replication? Where's the arbitration? I think when people use the black shows, they're so busy getting an output that they don't stop Yeah. That's called the option gap. What is the standard deviation change? Of course, the replicating for instance, it's called the option vega. Everything that option traders are talking about is something to do with the replicating because it's at the heart of option price. In fact, it's at the heart of how you hedge options, is it correct? If I have a big option position, the intuitive way to think of N of D1 and N of D2 is it's a probability. So you go back to the previous page, say by N of D1, that's the number of shares, but it's also a rough estimate just the dividends. And in this model, here's all you do. You have to make an assumption that the dividend yield stays constant over the life of the auction. That's the easiest way to do it. So let's say your dividend yield is 2%, and your risk-free rate is 4%. The modifications are pretty intuitive. What happens to D1 and D2 would reflect the fact that I now have dividends that I collect. Remember the replicating portfolio? I bought the underlying stock and I borrowed money. I'm now collecting growth, the margins, none of that stuff. That affects the value of the underlying asset. The option derives from the underlying asset. So if you look at, there's one small catch, I've used the Black-Sch early exercise. You have undeveloped oil reserves as an option. You want to develop the reserves? I would think so, well before the end date where you can't develop them anymore. Real options almost by definition will get exercised early. from a black-shoulds model, and remember it's going to be a conservative estimate because the European option is the low end of the value. You could pass it about exercise earlier, it would only make the option more valuable. It's better to get an estimate that doesn't require so much work that you give up on doing it, than to go for an estimate that's going to be so much out of your reach that you can't use it. Now just as an aside, you're drawing all of the possible outcomes. And here you can actually have more than, unlike a binomial, you only have two choices. You can have four branches, three branches. The difference is you have to attach probabilities to the branches. If you're willing to draw a full decision, and it's what I know it takes tremendous amounts of information, and attach probabilities, you can get an expected out of a decision tree, in a business, if the expected value is 50, but the outcomes are either 100 or zero, whilst you could value it at 50, in reality, the downside is so significant to your business operations, in a way, I guess you're not diversified across lots of different decisions. How does that? That's why it's not quite an expected value. Once you get past that, because it exceeds my initial investment. So the risk is already factored into the option pricing, but what it's also bringing in is all of the different outcomes that can happen as a present value. That's why it's uncertainly matters. Because if you're certain about the present value today, and it's less than the initial investment, there is no option there. You're going to turn the project down, it's amped up. It's because you're uncertain about how this project will evolve in the future that you add that premium or that. how much was spreadsheet, what is actually a very powerful technology to value financial assets into value real assets. So let's start with options and projects and investments. In a traditional way we've been taught to look at projects as cash flows, competitive investment, come up with an negative, it's a bad project, positive, it's a good project. But as I said, there are three things we know when we do expect. Third is the option to abandon, which is a really long term investment, being able to walk away from your investment. It's a great deal of homage being paid to be flexible as a company, especially in the aftermath of COVID and for companies that are flexible have an advantage. I think they do. The option to abandon actually is a measure of how much flexibility have you built into your model, an exclusive right to take a project. So let's say you have an exclusive right. That exclusive right today, if you developed it, might have a negative net present value. The project can change over time, right? The technology can change, the market can change. The net present value can go from being negative to positive. So as I said, every real auction I'm gonna talk about, I'm gonna introduce with a payoff diagram. So here's what the payoff diagram looks like for the future. I'm going to use this option to delay setup to look at two aspects of investing. One is the value of a patent, which I think can be trained very simply as an option to delay. And the other is the value of undeveloped resources, so oil, gold, whatever you have, and value gain as an option. So let's start with valuing a patent. What do you get with a patent? whatever it is. And let's say the present value of the cash flows you will get if you develop the patent today because that's all you can tell me, you can't tell me what is in the future, is B. So I is what you need to invest to develop the patent, B is the present value of the expected cash flows from developing the patent. If B is greater than I, you will develop the patent. It's in the money option. If B is less than I, the variance in that present value is what I need. You think, where am I going to find that? This is not a traded stock. I'll give you a couple of ways you can perhaps get that number. But that variance is what's driving the value of this option. So if I were to list out the variance, the value of the underlying assets, and present value of the cash flows, There are two ways. One is the easy and perhaps lazy way, which is to look up the standard deviation of stocks in the AI space and say, market must know something, I'll use that standard deviation. The other is, what would we do? We did Monte Carlo simulations, we got an expected value. We did this with Disney, or with, was it Exxon Mobil, I think, or Royal Dutch. I got a value per share, then I got a standard deviation, that value. I could do the same sit on every option the very last day of the patent expires, you've in a sense lost the value of the option. So every year you wait after an option becomes viable, you're giving up something. Because here's the trade-off. Let's say two years in once a pattern becomes something. Are you developing now? Are you developing now? Because you keep putting it off too long, you're giving up too much of that protection. That is the S. S is the present under the cash flows. Have any of you seen how pharmaceutical companies compute cash flows in a drug? It's actually a scary exercise because here's how it will go. Start with the percentage of the population that has MS. Then you look at what percentage of those people actually go to adopt. sold them off to other former companies. It's an R&D operation, but this drug they wanted to develop on their own. And they estimated that it would cost them about $2.9 billion to set up the infrastructure to actually develop and sell the drug, 2.875. So let me pause right there. 2.875 billion wouldn't cost them to set up the infrastructure. The present value cash flow from developing the drug is 3,422 million. you have some time as your ally. Riskless rate was 6.7%. This is a very risky business. I tried a multigod simulation, but in the late 90s, I had the architecture, the low crystal ball. Today I might try a bootleg simulation. In the late 90s, I basically took the standard deviation of biotech companies and assumed that that's all driven by the uncertainty about biotech products. And you said it's not a perfect model, it's not a pin option, it's all that put in place. The value that I get for the option is $907 million. So your buyers have two numbers here. $547 million, which is that first number. So what do you get if you do what? You develop the drug to almost year nine because the benefits of waiting is so low. But there's one final part of the story that I think brings us back to biotin actually almost instantaneously developed the drug. What am I missing in my cost to delay? Because the cost there is what's causing this waiting7, they thought they had a four-year lead on the competition. You know what that makes the cost of delay? 1 over 4, which is 25%. You put in a 25% cost of delay, the option pricing value drops to $350 million, which is less than the $547 million. I think that we over either the only or not the only curve being embedded in the cash flows that you estimate? No, but it's on top of it. So it will affect both your expected cash flows and so you might have pricing power for the next five years, but this is over and above that, right? It's how quickly do we need to jump on to start making money before somebody else comes in and makes those margins even lower. So I think that even if you build into your margins, it's not have a very valuable pattern. You say, how do I make this a company? Because you can't go out and buy shares in a drug, right? You've got to buy shares in a company. Let's say you're interested in biogen, you like Avonex, you say, but I want to value biogen as a company. Well, the way, one way to do it is in the discarded cash loan model, if I told you biogen is Avonex and it's a great non-question drug, that's what you would go through. How do you reflect that in a DCM model? You value the existing products that the company has. It's a traditional discounted test for valuation. No growth, just make the existing products, value those products. Second stop, you value the options, just like I did. Evidence, you value the options. And the third step, and this is the trickiest, you take the existing R&D and you ask, how much value will my existing R&D create or destroy over time? You already see why, right? We talked about how R&D can be value created and value destroyed. to discount the 50 million back today. At the right discount rate. So what's the discount rate I should use on these expected cash flows? These are buyer gens' expected cash flows, but who's paying that? Merck or Upjohn or whoever's getting the drug, right? Who's bought the rights to the drug from you? What are they guarantee you? They guarantee you that they will pay you 50 million in cash. So what are you worried about? The fault. So I think it's so easy we jump on to a cost to capital for a company. But think about the risk and the cash flow. The present value of the cash flow is 397.1%. So I've got a value of Avernix as an option. I've got the value of the existing drugs they have as the present value of cash flows. I turn to the R&D and I tell you, I can make up stuff here, get some numbers to it. Why? Because who knows what the quantity of R&D, they create on an expected basis 125 million cash flows. That's pretty much the total capital, about 3-4% of the cost of capital. So $1.25 each year. And I'm going to love the fact that this is much riskier than everything else about biogen. And here I'm going to use a cost of capital of biogen value of the R&D is going to go to zero. And if the return on capital is 3% with all the cost of capital, the continuing R&D is actually going to have a negative value. It's going to reduce the value of the company. So this becomes the vehicle that you use to tell me whether you think this company as an R&D department is worth adding smaller because once you create a portfolio of options, the benefits of looking at individual options stuff, and that's what traditional DCF models allow you to say, I have a portfolio of options, I'm going to use great so it does mean that there'll be a redirecting of R&D so you're saying why is my migraines and why isn't somebody coming up", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 84.97], "text": " Recording in progress.
