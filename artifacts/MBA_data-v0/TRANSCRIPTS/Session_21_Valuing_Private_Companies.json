{"text": " Okay. material that I mostly do on Monday would not really be on the quest, but through everything. So let's talk about valuing private companies. And if you remember, I started the discussion with this issue of, with publicly traded companies, we make this assumption, perhaps cavalierly, that the marginal investor is diversified. You think, why? Why does it matter? What is the bias when you assume the marginal investor is diversified? Bill Gates at the peak of his glory had almost 100% of his wealth tied up in Microsoft. The difference was it was a public company. So the margin of investment, there could be some institutional investment, but it's a private business. You've got undiversified buyers and undiversified sellers. We're going to talk about what to do mechanically about it, but I want to get a sense of intuition. You have two companies. They look exactly the same, same business, same kinds of characteristics, but one is privately owned and the other is publicly traded. risk in a company, the public company, I'm going to say stop. I don't care that styles change. I don't care if that happens because I can diversify it away as an investor. I don't have that luxury when I have all my wealth tied up in a business. So today we're going to see that private company cost of equities are going to be significantly higher than public company. How much it depends on the business you're in, right? Some businesses, most of your risk might be market related. In the banking business, for instance, 80% a series of talks I'm giving at Point72. You know what binds Point72 and the Mets together? They're both owned by Steve Kohn. So Point72 is in Hudson Yard, so the Mets management. And yesterday afternoon, I was working on a corporate finance presentation for the Mets. It's a fascinating application of corporate finance principles. diversified investor than an undiversified investor. I'm going to say lots of nice things about the Yankees and not so nice things about the Mets, but in this one, I'm going to argue that the Mets have an advantage over the Yankees. Who owns the Yankees? Steinbrenner family, right? How much of their wealth is in the Yankees? Pretty much all of it. So if you think about decision-making, if you have only 10% with sports teams, it's all about pricing. I can't think of a single professional sports franchise where the people running it think of it as a business. They're being pushed out. I mean, take the NFL. The Pittsburgh Steelers are owned by the Rooney family. One of the old-time owners who's run it as a business. They're the outliers. I mean, the Redskins are up for sale. You see the prices that people are offering for the Redskins? the Seattle Mariners. The Oakland A's have a city problem. I mean, in a sense, the problem for Oakland A's is they're in a media market where they've essentially lost the fight. Because San Francisco Giants own that market. It might be the same media market. So it's not going to be the Oakland A's for very much longer. It could be the Las Vegas A's for all we know. But that's only a matter of time for the Seattle Mariners. every single one if you think about mlb collectively things don't look good on revenues the collective revenues of the mlb have been pretty flat and attendance has dropped so it's a flat revenue business i told you the ebitda is collectively 600 million you know big companies are barely making money the teams are barely making money so it's low revenue growth terrible margins newspaper that's because you're buying a trophy asset you're buying something where you're not treating it as a business you're buying it for the same reason by art which means to price these you've got to find other trophy assets this gets very closely to how you price things so you price professional sports teams are looking at other properties so the day the redskins get sold for seven billion guess what happens the data's cowboys pricing it's going to hit 10 billion I'll do the mensing. I'll send you all the presentations if you're interested. The corporate finance presentation for professional sports teams. Stakeholders in a professional sports team, very different than stakeholders in a company. It's about how do you make debt decisions in a sports team. So that'll come soon. So let's talk about the private company. Today, we will come up with a way of adjusting a private company's cost of equity for the fact that the potential buyer is undiversified. term in liquidity is you value a private company and you knock off 20% or 25%. Why? Because private companies are illiquid. Today, I want to challenge that notion. First, that you automatically take an illiquidity discount, and then it has to be the same for every private company. In fact, just to set up that discussion that's going to come, let's suppose that I came to you with four private businesses. You're worried about illiquidity has negative cash flows. Why do you need liquidity less in the first company? What's liquidity? You need cash, right? The company itself is throwing off cash in a sense, it's already partially liquid. So money losing company should have bigger, your bigger worries about the liquidity than money making company. Because you cannot come up with a discount without knowing who the potential buyer is. If the potential buyer is a long-term buyer who doesn't really need the cash, you can try for a lower discount. You might not get it, but you should start with a credit. Is this pricing or valuation? It is valuation, but in a sense, the value is different to different buyers. With public companies, that can't happen because the lower-cost buyers get pushed out of the process. 2008 crisis. The market is in meltdown. Everybody's scared. The other is five years later, things are looking good. Economy's humming along. The market's doing well. Which period is the discount going to be larger? During the crisis. I mean, now I'm saying your discount is going to be a function not just of the company you're trying to value, but the buyer you're looking at and the time you're around. So if you look around and bid-ask spreads are rising in publicly is it 134 yeah so here's what I'm going to do today I'm going to value a private business for a private to private transaction process as I said this is where every conceivable complexity that you can think of comes into play so I'm going to keep it very simple So I'll set it up. The restaurant is doing pretty well. In the most recent year, it reported $1.2 million in revenues and $400,000 in pre-tax operating profit, at least according to the restaurant financials. The firm has no conventional debt outstanding, but it has one lease debt outstanding, where the restaurant is to pay $120,000 each year for the next 12 years. because you're going to be buying the restaurant. You've got to figure out what to do. You've got wages, material, other operating expenses. So basically, it looks like the financials are pretty reasonably done. Nothing is being held back. Hopefully, there's no fraud. But there are two things. One is the lease expense is treated as an operating expense. This wasn't just him. It was everybody was doing this at the time that I did this. All companies were doing this. The second is that he hasn't charged himself. So we've talked about that correction that kicks in, but you have the lead. So let's start with the discount rate part because it's a more manageable part. It's a part that I worried about the most because of this diversified non-diversified. So conventional risk and return models, of course, you assume investors are diversified. With private businesses, if the buyer, with the buyer who's not diversified, this is going to break down. And we already talked about which direction. So if I were to set this up, but in this case what's the data that i'm trying to explain um how much of the variation in stock returns is explained by the market in other words the r squared is a is a measure of the proportion of the variance in this company that is explained by the market so it's one minus the r squared yeah it's a portion of the variance that's not explained by the market so if i can get this for every restaurant company don't step back and say, hey, what's the right group of companies that I should be using for the beta? So the unlevered beta for those high-end retailers was 1.18. So I was starting for this, it's 1.18. But here's where the fact that the buyer is not diversified is going to throw me off. If I use that 1.18 beta, I'm focusing only on the market risk the standard deviation of the stock and the numerator divided by the sigma of the market. So it's a standard deviation. You think so what? I'm going to take the square root of the r squared, which of course gives me the correlation coefficient. The reason I use the correlation coefficient, beta is a standard deviation measure, so I'm going to stay with the standard deviation analog. The square root of 0.25 is 0.5. each publicly traded restaurant. So I'm not running a regression of restaurants collectively. I'm running a regression of each publicly traded. So if I take Chipotle, I take the returns in Chipotle run against the S&P 500 to get a beta in R squared. So I do this with each company. So it's exactly like the bottom up beta process, but now I brought in the R squared as well. So what you see are the averages across publicly traded restaurants. So my total beta is 2.36. You'll have no idea what you're talking about. So hang up the phone very quickly because it'll open you up to two choices you have in terms of a debt to equity ratio in terms of private companies. One is you can look at publicly traded companies, look at their debt to equity ratios. In this case, that would have been about 14.33% for publicly traded restaurants and say, if a publicly traded restaurant has a debt ratio, that must come from the kind of business they're in. And every private business in that space will have the same debt to equity. you get out of this process? You do a DCF, you value the firm, you subtract out it, you get a value back with it, right? Could I use that estimated value to get debt to equity? I could, but there's a little bit of a catch. What's the problem I'm going to run into? I'm going to have circularity, right? Check the iteration box and accept. It's magical. Try it out. And use your estimated value of equity as the equity in a debt to equity ratio. Now while the lease debt is treated, lease expense is treated as an operating expense, I'm going to do what I've always done which is capitalize leases and come up with the synthetic rating. The synthetic rating I came up with was the other minor twist was the debt to equity ratio. I had to make this judgment on do I go with an industry average or my own estimated dollars. Second stop, I redid the financial. Redid in what sense? I put in a cost for the chef, $150,000. And obviously, I've got to go do my homework. How much will it cost me to get a well-regarded chef at the restaurant? in Asia and Latin America, is you go and ask the owner to show you their financials. They will give you the financials and you'll take one look at this country, right? You're losing money every single year. Why these are my official financials for the tax guy. And then you'd have to go into a back room, lock the door, make sure that nobody can see you. And the second set of financials come out, which are the unofficial financials,'t care who the chef is. But there's no easy way to get this without having a gauge of how much loyalty customers have to the particular chef or owner and how many of those adjusted for the fact that you've got a key person to start. I come up with the cost of capital reinvestment rate. So I've got my free cash for the firm. There's my operating income grown out one year, one minus the tax rate, one minus 13.25% discount. But there's one more final step to do, right? That's a value that I get the restaurant after adjusting for the fact that the buyer is not diversified. But there's an illiquidity issue that still has not been dealt with. The question is, how big a discount do I need to attach to this 521,000? appraisal, it gets, you know, for the tax guy, for the divorce court, it ends up in court. So they wanted to create an infrastructure that backed up these discounts. You can go to court and say, look, there's a study that backs it up. And if you look at private company discounts, the studies that back up the discounts come from two sets of studies. One are studies of what are called restricted stock. You know what restricted stock studies and why you shouldn't trust them. You build a whole infrastructure of this kind. The second is looking at what happens pre-IPO. Remember, you have a private company that's going to go public in three months. In those three months, often you have transactions between owners, VCs and founders selling. And if you can observe the price on what they pay, show discounts of 25, 30, 35%. It's great for appraisals. You know why? Because most appraisal is for tax reasons and you want low number. It's so private company appraises well to have these studies back them up when they say we have a 25% discount and here's a restricted stock strategy. Most of these studies just compute a median discount. So there are dozens and dozens of restricted stock transactions that take a dummy variable. Earnings making money or not making money. The companies making money should have smaller discounts. And if the person buying the restricted stock was a customer, he argued that because of that, you might end company with 25 million in revenues. That's a money making company. Based on the regression, the discount should be about 24%. But if that same company is losing money, the discount should be 32%. If you compare that to a billion dollar company, billion dollar company that's making money, the discount should be 18%. So essentially, I'm taking the regression and coming up with the way irrespective of the industry, like the sector that they are in? It shouldn't matter, right? Restrictions are restrictions, right? Why would you care less about a discount in one industry than another? Give me the intuition because then I can start to bring it in. What is it about? I mean, say like the grocery stores. So you're saying safer businesses should have smaller discounts than riskier businesses, I agree, right? If you were rerunning service regression, what would you do? How would you bring that in? What did I say about restricted stock? When you place it, you essentially, those people can't trade the stock, right? And you're settling for what? 30% discount, 25% discount, 20% discount. That's a lot of money to leave on the table, right? So when you think about the kinds of companies that issue restricted stock, no healthy company is ever going to issue restricted stock. It's just too much left on the table. So almost by exclusion, who knew enough statistics that they could take the restricted stock studies and figure out how much of that discount came from the fact that these were troubled companies, distressed companies, small companies. And statistically, there's a way to break it up. And he concluded that about 25% to 35% discount came from the sampling bias. You take that out, your discount all of a sudden goes from 35% to 10%. It's a moment of You're a venture capitalist in a firm that's planning to go public in three months. You expect the price to be $1,000 per share. Would you accept $500 per share? I wouldn't. So what does that tell me? There's something wrong with these standards. Either they're making up the numbers or they're missing something So here's what I'm going to do. Remember I said there's a cost of buyer's remorse even when you buy publicly traded shares. What's that cost? It's a bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread is the illiquidity discount for a publicly traded company. percentage of the price for every stock. You've got an illiquid discount for every stock. And now your sample size, because it's thousands of stock, you can run the regression against level of rep. Some things that you can observe for a private company as well. So about 15 years ago, I decided to run this regression. The fact that I've not revisited tells you how much of a pain it was to do. I don't value private companies, so I don't particularly care what the illiquid discount is. But if I cared, I would rerun this regression every year. So I took the restaurant that I just gave you and plugged in the revenues for the restaurant, 1.2 million, the fact that it's a money-making company, the cash was 5% of that and viable, reasonable discount because it doesn't have that sampling bias that permeates the first two approaches. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the 521,000 that are estimated the value of equity to be and knock off 12.88% of that value to come up with a value of equity for this company. So it's going to end up at like 440,000 by the time I'm all done. Yes. a group and maybe even start quantifying. The problem, as I said, is people have become so used to applying this rule of thumb that nobody wants to do the dirty work of actually building up in a liquidity risk from scratch. Nobody's too strong, but very few people want to deal with it. They prefer to keep this 20 to 25% and just move on. And I think we need to go back and look at liquidity more carefully and how to bring it on cap, which I don't think you should, and small cap companies earn higher returns because they're less liquid, pushing up the discount rate is going to push down the value. You knock another 25% of that value for liquidity, didn't you punish the company twice once we're pushing up the discount rate? Okay, that's actually a very good question. What if the buyer were a private equity investor who's sector focused? So, you know, they're diversified, but they're diversified across 25 manufacturing companies or steel companies or software companies. First, if you create a portfolio of 25 software companies, what I computed as a correlation was an individual software companies. If I create a portfolio of 25 software companies, will the correlation in the market go up or go down? leads to the consequences, right? It's going to push down your cost of equity. It's going to push up what you're willing to pay. It's what KKR and Blackstone have done to the private equity businesses by becoming these more diversified investors who are themselves publicly traded. They've removed the need to charge for company-specific risk. And they're competing against more traditional sector focus. They're going to beat them out. They go head to head. They're going to win almost every single time. company. What's the risk you should be building into your cost of equity? Whose money are they investing? Their investors' money, right? They're publicly traded. Their investors are diversified. I can go back to a market beta, this total beta. We don't put in a total beta because the company is private, but because the buyer was not diversified. Here, you've taken it to the limit. The buyer is potentially fully diversified. I'm going to go to a market beta. A public No, the liquidity is to your investors, right? It's not to you as a company. Your investors can sell their shares anytime they want. So with public companies, that's why, otherwise valuing public companies is going to be a nightmare, right? Because you can think of every public company as a collection of illiquid assets. Take Tesla. I mean, you have a bunch of illiquid assets, those factories. So if I decide to start attaching liquidity discounts to what public companies own, because if they sold that asset, I'm diversified. But I know that your alternatives are not diversified. So you know what the negotiation is going to come down to. So you're going to have two numbers in your pocket as a seller. You're going to have the 453,000, which is what you'd get from another potential undiversified buyer. You have the 1.5 million that you would get. You're going to start your bidding at 1.5. You're saying, look, you're not diversified. offer the owners of these businesses a higher number than they can get from any private transaction, but a much lower number than what they can afford to pay. You get to keep the difference. As long as you only, the second player enters the game, all bets are off, right? Because then the bidding wars are going to start. companies to keep them private, it would be very difficult for them to justify the prices they pay because they'd be offering well below the market price. But because they view this as good plan, I mean definition of success in private equity is you hold it for two or three years then you exit by either selling to a public company or by taking it public yourself. So the effect of the lack of diversification tends to be smaller and becomes So if you think about the prices, you've got two extreme values, 453,000, 1.48 million. Where you will end up will be entirely a function of what the relative numbers are on each side. There are lots of potential public buyers for your business. You can end up closer to the 1.48 million. Conversely, if there's only one public buyer, a lot of private buyers, that private equity investors have actually been very active in that shop or these small shop ones where they actually go in and buy 50 of the shop and they offer them what looks like a bargain price or a high price to the shop owner because they sold it to another shop owner that have got a lower number but effectively it's private equity investors coming in and arbitraging the space between being a private business with all these penalties are a couple of issues you want to deal with one is that when you make a public offering there is a process you've got to go through there are now challenges the process but the traditional process is you went and hired an investment banker the investment banker valued your company let's back that up it's really not value price to your company and then they guarantee an offering price sounds too good to beate. So the value that I came up with for Twitter on the day of its prospector is $17.36. If you look at this valuation, it looks very similar to a typical public company valuation, right? You could say, well, it's a market beta. So it looks very similar to a public company valuation, but there are a couple of things in this valuation that make it a little bit. Spotify went public, the entire proceeds were cashed out by existing owners. So that's one choice you can cash out. What else can you do? One is you can hold it as cash because you don't want to reinvest in it. The day after the IPO, the cash balance for a company is going to balloon out by the amount that came. The third is if you have taken on venture debt or any debt with high interest rates, you can pay it out. lower debt ratio and presumably a different cost of capital. If the $16 billion were cashed out by existing owners, I'm going to act like it never existed in any way because it goes out of the company. Yes? The prospectus. Usually, if you read the prospectus and pick up any prospectus, there will be a section where they tell you what they plan to do with the proceeds. It's a requirement in every prospectus. And you can see what that is before you value the company. the next five years, I'd probably attach a high failure rate because I'm saying you have to go raise the capital. What if it doesn't happen? Let's say this company does an IPO and it's rich enough that they can raise the cash to cover the next five years of cash flows. It's still the same cash flows. It puts the cash balance, but my failure rate, which I'm going to be in 25% the day before the IPO can drop to five or 10% because they is to clean up to make sure that when you take the company public, you're counting all of that stuff. Those are valuation issues. Talk about the pricing issues. What did the investment banker guarantee you? A price, right? So let's say you as an investment banker price a company at $20. Would you guarantee the $20 as you're offering? Well, you want to discount it. It's in and it goes out of the other window. So it doesn't change anything in your valuation. If it's used to pay down debt, it's going to change your debt ratio and your cost of capital. And if it's kept as cash, it's going to increase your cash balance, creating that jump in value on the opening day. And this is sometimes called pre-money, post-money, I don't know whether you even want to use that language. Post-IPO, you get that extra money coming in to do DCF value plus that extra cash. from prior equity investors do what we do in traditional valuation to the extent that there are options out there and rights and special deals clean up for all of that because that's going to come out of your own and in the money out of the money and one of the nice things about an ipo again is all these multiple classes of shares will get consolidated and converted to common stock when facebook went public there were seven classes of convertible preferred stock, 86 million restricted stock, 44.16 million options, all of this came right out of the prospectus. The 44.16 million options, I'm going to value as options. So basically I do with what I do with traditional companies, all of the other shares, including non-vested restricted shares, I count as shares outstanding. banking what are the services investment bankers offer i do let's go down the list underwriting so once a guarantee the pricing guarantee what else book run in which case they offer a seller so book runner basically means you know they're getting on the phone or whatever the equivalent is in the digital age they're contacting portfolio management they're doing road shows essentially so they're selling your shares what else are they valuing your company that used to be one of the things that bankers did for IPOs and ask, are they still valuable today? The selling part, right? It's a big deal in the old days. Why? Because nobody had heard about your company. Goldman Sachs would have to get on and tell people, you know, this is what the company does. I would wager more people had heard about Facebook than Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley at the time Facebook went public. So the we need bankers? What's your turn? Instead of going through banks and setting an offering price, a direct listing, which is like an auction, right? Basically, that's, you know, so basically what you do is you bypass the process. You don't set a price. You let the demand and supply set the price in the opening day. There's no discount offer. You're leaving no money on the table. But it does come with a catch. Please, right now more about technology than you do. You assume he would find. So he doesn't even tell you what company is going to buy. He's giving it to him and trusting. I think you can find a company with this three billion. And he says, trust me, I'll find the right company. I'll negotiate the right price. I'll get you a great deal. And in return for this, what did he get? And finally, go ahead. It's an SEC requirements and direct listing. The SEC wants to protect you from yourself. They view direct listings as having a potential. They actually think bankers are good screeners of scams. So basically you won't get, they're worried that companies will go directly to the market, fool investors. So they've set pricing all the time. I don't even know why IPO bank is even bothered with this kind of cash flow valuations because it's a pricing game. People have tried and it hasn't worked. So tell me what goes wrong when I set up a strategy saying, look, I'm going to buy every IPO that comes into the market and I'm going to ask for a thousand shares. What's going to go wrong? Bankers will restrict you. But you make it sound like bankers have a conspiracy against you. But think about this process, right? There's demand and supply for the shares. In those companies where bankers have underpriced the shares, there will be too many people asking for shares. your underpriced stocks. That's why mutual funds. In fact, I remember these first studies came out in the market. People said, you know, we can make money on this. And I know a couple of people started mutual funds to invest just in IPOs. When you look at their actual returns, not seeing any of this excess return there. And it's because of the process. One other question. I said that there's this discount of 15% on average. That's money out of the pocket of the founders, right? And the VCs have been OK with the discounting is they view it as kind of a, you know, sales leaders in retail stores. We basically come in, they're selling stuff at below cost. They think they would sell below our price because we make it up later because we are actually not planning. We can't even sell our shares for six months or the regulatory framework to allow direct listings to become more common. Could SPACs do it? Maybe if I paid 3%. Bill Ackman had a SPAC as well, where he lowered the 20% to 6% because he said 20% people are not, that's a lot of money to leave on the um yeah the reinvestment in one of the companies that somebody pitched in the michael price fund it really caught my attention that they had negative working capital they had huge things basically what they said. So your suppliers, this is funding. Suppliers with no interest, right? That's what makes the value go up. The only reason this is showing up is because we're providing which is the discount law. So in effect, it might not show up in the traditional ratings, ratings agencies do look at how much supplier credit you have on the value sheet. Good times they might overlook it, but in bad times often that's one of the red flags. There are a lot of supplier credit. What if you're not able to make those things? So your rating that you compute for the company based on a synthetic rating is much more questionable with the company which uses supplier credit or the company that does not. an online book retailer. But they only paid when they sell. Exactly. No, they collected the cash, but they had three months' terms. They didn't have to pay the publisher. They had a negative operating cycle. As a small company, this was a huge item. As Amazon scared up, that minus 20% went to minus 18, minus 15, minus 7, minus 3, and now it's close to 0% because at the scaling that they're at now, it doesn't work. You can't scale up. So if you're doing non-cash working capital as a person with revenues, if I keep projecting your balance sheet out at some point in time, and very quickly, my balance sheet is going to start to blow up. So a valuation where there's non-cash working capital, there's very little net cap back. And the non-cash working capital is a negative number that gets more negative over time. It's a valuation that's built on balance sheets that don't balance. And ROIC will go to the moon. It'll go to a high number and then it'll become negative. Because the capital actually goes, you know. In practice, what's going to blow the company up, if this is the reality, is that you're going to have to pay at some point and in a moment of turmoil, might not have cash. Yeah, but I think also you'll have a context of what auditor is going to sign off on your balance sheet, which doesn't balance. Some things happen, right? Because you're missing, right? Because otherwise, you're going to end up with a balance sheet, which on the liability side is a huge current liabilities item. What's on the asset have to leave it at zero because the only way- Because you're not distributing. So you can't do a discounted cash flow model because in the discounted cash flow model- You're distributing, yeah, you're distributing. Some way or the other, the model is breaking down. Yeah. So that's the question I would have when you have no net cap banks, you have big negative working capital that stays big and negative and gets more negative over time. How's the balance of balance? Okay, makes sense, thank you. and do that instead of using the epoxy. And I was gonna try another multiple EV only resource size. I think it's the same thing as what we need. As a lecture you mentioned that there is an opportunity to build that why they exist such a scenario that many other people such as the area If you allow the banker to set a price lower, it's like having the realtor guarantee the price, but hasn't mentioned the price. The way they guarantee the price is they take whatever price you have. An ox off 20%. I guarantee the price. Pay me a commission for the guaranteed price. You're going to say, of course not. Anybody can set my house at 20% below the market price. So to me, this is the least of the services bankers provide. This is not what you pay.
