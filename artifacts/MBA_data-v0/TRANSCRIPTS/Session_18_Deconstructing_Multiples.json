  "text": " Thank you. you class, but if you can get that to-do list done, you're pretty much done with your project. You can set it to the side. There's not that much group work involved in this project, and that was intentional. I wanted much of this project to be individual, partly because you guys are sick of each other. I mean, let's face it, your second year MBAs, you haven't got enough time. You've had your share of group work, so this is more each of the other variables and I want you to think about what you would look for in a mismatch you have low PE on growth you want low growth high growth you want high growth because low growth would explain it away so low PE high growth 50 years ago, doing this might have involved a lot of work, but now it's almost effortless, but you at least have the template for thinking through what makes the stock cheap. We're also today going to talk about revenue multiples. As I said, revenue multiples are often used by people because they're desperate. Earnings are negative, EBITDA is negative, you keep climbing the income statement, and the revenue is the first positive number you have. But you're looking at revenue multiples in a sector where they've historically been used more widely, retail. And what's the, what's a variable. So let's say you're running an S&P Capital IQ screen so you're going to have low enterprise value so what's a variable that you might want thought a picture would bring home the message much more directly. So yesterday I went on the CVS website and I looked up aspirin, not that I want it, but I just want to see what. So I found a pair of aspirin, $8.69 and CVS aspirin. I made sure they were both coded. Otherwise you'd compare that one is coded for the mismatches. So when you look at a multiple, PE ratio, EV to EBITDA, EV to sales, there are two questions you want to address and answer. First is, what are the variables? What are the fundamentals that drive this multiple? Now, so when you look at a multiple, what do we know? Is it growth? Is it cashflow? Is it return equity? So first, you're gonna look for, because behind every multiple, as I mentioned, right at the start of if growth doubles for a company, will the PE ratio also double? Will it go by 50%, 60%? Because without doing it, you can't price companies. And I'm going to give you a template, a very simple way in which you can back out, not only what the variables are, but get'm doing pricing. Why am I going to go back to a dividend discount model? With a little bit of algebra, and I'm going to show this with the PE ratio, you can take that discounted cash flow model and make it a model to estimate what the PE ratio for a company should be or the price to book ratio. And in the process of doing that, you can say, these are the variables that drive this multiple. So with an equity multiple, go back to the simplest equity valuation model But if I have an equation and divide both sides of the equation by a constant, it remains an equation, right? So what if I divide both sides of the equation by the earnings per share? Price divided by earnings per share gives me P ratio. What's dividends divided by earnings per share? Dividends per share. That's payout ratio. You're saying, why is there a one plus G? Because I need it for next year., of course, a stable growth model. It's designed for mature companies, but at least for mature companies now, you have a structure for explaining what the PE ratio for that company should be. Again, you will never use this model, but if you look at that equation, it already tells you the variables that drive the PE ratio, right? It's driven by the payout ratio, the cost of equity, and the growth rate. That's what the first term in the equation is. And the second is the terminal value. So basically, I've taken what we do in an Excel spreadsheet and written as an equation. That's the value of my stock with a two-stage dividend discount model. So I'm going to start by setting up a hypothetical example of a company in high growth. So these numbers are completely made up. So hang in there as they are. It's got an expected growth rate of 15% for the next five years and one and a half percent after that. Its payout ratio is 25% right now, low because it so high? Because my risk-free rate is low. My cost of equity is low. So when you look at this company as a high growth company, you're saying 29.15, that sounds like a high earnings. In this case, that would have been a justifiable P ratio with a risk-free rate of 1. makes sense. Higher risk-free rates lead to lower P ratios. A little later in this class, I'm going to talk about one of the traps that a lot of value investors fell into is they compared P ratios across time. And during the last decade, they stayed out of stocks. You know why? Because the P ratio of stocks looked too high. But there's a very simple explanation for why they were high. It's because risk-free the effect of a surprise on growth is much smaller. When interest rates are low, that same surprise on growth has a much bigger impact. You say, how would I get surprised by growth? You know the mechanism by which the surprise is delivered? You've invested in a high growth company. How do you wake up to the realization? What is it that wakes you up to the realization? Maybe you're screwed up. It's usually an the future, right? Let's take an extreme example. Let's suppose risk free rates rise to a thousand percent. You're in hyperinflation. How much is growth? So let's say a 15 percent growth. How much is that growth worth? A thousand percent is worth nothing. in is with higher risk-free rates, you should expect to see smaller reactions to earning surprises than you did two years ago, simply because the value of growth has become lower for every company across the board. Any questions on growth surprises and peer issues? Now that I was asking what-if questions, the second what-if question I asked was, hey, what if I used a beta one, right? What if I'd used a beta that was higher or lower? Again, high PE ratios because you're getting the best of both combinations. If you look at the other end, I'll call these investment dogs, your company's high risk and low growth. Who wants that? But to the extent they exist, you're going to price them in. If you go for stocks with low PE ratios and that's your only criteria, I'm going to buy low PE stocks, guess which ones you're going to load up your portfolio with? risk is going to be far greater than the payoff from focusing on an extra 1% or 2% or 3% of growth. Yes? How do we find out what's the optimum? What would you like? If you're a company, what would you like your PE ratio to be? So there is no optimum, right? You want the highest possible PE ratio. In a good way, right? high growth and low risk. That is not the truth. Eventually, it's going to come back to bite you. So there is no optimum P-E ratio, but you want to get the highest price you can given your true fundamentals. You don't want to oversell your company on dimensions that are not true. Ed? To reduce your risk, you could, but there will be a consequence, right? What are the sectors with the lowest risk of growth? subscription-based revenues are more stable than update-based revenues. You're less dependent on people doing the updates in good times and not doing it in bad times. So one is changing towards a different business model might make you less risky. The trade-off then might be you might have to settle for slightly lower growth on a subscription-based model than you do on an update-based model. But you're doing the trade-off of saying, I'm going to go for less risk, with a subscription-based model. But you're right, if it's only firm-specific, it's not going to do much good for you. But to the extent that a lot of stuff you're doing is also smoothing things out, even as a macroeconomy shifts, you are making yourself a less risky company. Yes? So you said that as interest rates go up, the finance companies have less impact. Is that because like investor base has changed? No, it's just because present value effect. It's a pure present value effect, right? What's the value of growth? A lot of disinformation come from market gurus about P ratios doing strange things. So you'll see people making arguments about P ratios that are disconnected from reality because they're not factoring in those effects. Any other questions? Finally, I, you know, to show you that the growth again, we're using the foundations for comparing across companies. So remember that mismatch we talked about, low P, high growth, low risk. We now have the foundations for why we draw those connections, because you can see that with a hypothetical. So that's a nice thing about starting with these intrinsic value equations is not because we ever plan to use them to actually do an intrinsic pricing of a company. That'd be pointless because just replicate what we did in These are the cheapest markets in the world. Put all your money in them. How many of you want to take your portfolio out of where it is and spread it out across those markets? But here again, you're looking for a mismatch. As you're looking at that list, what should you be looking for? A country that doesn't belong, right? Maybe the British Virgin Islands, but I don't even know what those companies are, to be quite honest. Who would be trading in the British Virgin Islands? I pulled up a list of emerging markets of the P ratios. I also pulled up three fundamentals for each of these markets. I pulled up the level of interest rates in each of these markets, the GDP real growth in each of these markets and country risk in each of these markets. Again, if you want to eyeball the data, what's the combination you want? You want a low P on interest rates. You want low interest rates or high interest rates. You want low interest rates on real growth. You want low growth or high growth. Well, the three variables are listed there. So I ran the regression, and here's what the regression output looked like. There was an intercept. What does that tell me? Well, that basically is, you know, what the overall level of PE ratios are across. So, you know, not much I can read from that. It says minus 7.94 times interest rates. Every 1% increase in interest rate should lower my PE by 7.94. Statistics classes ruin you for life. Because everything in statistics classes, if you notice, have R-squares of 95%, to which my response is, why the heck are you wasting your time even testing something like this? Because if you have an R-square of 95%, you're testing obvious things like, how much beer do you drink and what's your GPA? Beyond a certain point, your GPA is probably going to go through the toilet, so why bother? and that country's real growth, I get a predicted PE ratio. So let's take Argentina. Actual PE was 14. It looked cheap, right? But once I control for the high risk and the high interest rates, my predicted PE is 13.57. It's actually slightly overvalued. So the predicted PE is, in a sense, a controlled prediction given the growth, the risk, and the interest rates in that region. So if I'm looking for undervalued, I'm looking for countries this and you get an R squared, some of you are going to say, is this good enough? Well, it's not good enough. You're just getting a range, right? So basically, if you have a lower R squared, it doesn't mean you can't use the regression. You get a wider range. It'll mean that more companies fall within the range. Don't fight the data. It is what it is. You can't make 30% R squared into a 95% by just pushing things into the globe. And how do you use it? If you're a global portfolio manager and you think about where should my money go on a pricing basis, it shouldn't go to the lowest PE markets because that'll end up being that list you saw earlier of the riskiest markets in the world. It should be those markets where the actual PE is much lower than what you'd predict it to be given the risk and the growth and the interest rates in that country. forth are actually variants of the same thing. Robert Shiller won a Nobel Prize for his book on irrational exuberance. And one of his arguments is stocks do get overpriced, underpriced. And he's created his own version of the P. It's actually the price divided by not just average earnings, but average earnings adjusted for inflation. So his argument is earnings from 12 years ago, you can't average with earnings today. So it the height of the market about two years ago, when interest rates were really low, I drew a graph where I decided to compare to the P ratio for stocks, the P ratio for T-bonds. You say, what P ratio for a T-bond? You pay a price for a bond. the p-e ratio for stocks the other is the p-e ratio for t-bonds and stocks don't become cheap or expensive on their own until you compare them to what you're making on bonds and t-bonds there's a very good explanation for why p-e ratios over the last decade was so much higher than they've been historically it's because interest rates were far lower in the last decade than any other decade in history those days might be done but at least when you look back in time you can explain why ratio. So it's actually the purple line here, the red line here, and the T-bond rate. You can already see the two tend to move together, right? As T-bond rates go up, earnings to price ratios go up. See, what's this third line, the purple line? That's a difference between the T-bond rate and the T-bill rate. You know what that's capturing? When that number is zero, you've got a flat yield curve. When that number is negative, you should trade at low P-E ratios. As T-bond rates come down, earnings to price ratios come down, which kind of makes sense. The second gives you the link between earnings to price ratios and the slope of the yield curve. So if you sit there and say, you know what, T-bond rates now at 3.5%, they're going to go to 8%. Let's say you're incredibly pessimistic about inflation. You say, what will happen to the earnings to price ratio? I can work out mechanically, this is how much your earnings to price ratio should go up. And every 1% increase in the slope of the yield curve, the more upward sloping it is, the lower my earnings to price ratio will become. even leaving in the regression. Notice the slope of the yield curve now has a t-statistic less than one. To show you how much things have changed, this was my regression through 2008. I've been running this regression every year. Compare the two regressions, and you can see already the effect on the yield curve has become much smaller over the last 15 years than it used to be. That's no longer true. That link seems to have broken and at least become weaker over the last 15 years. Now, if I asked you to use this regression to tell me what the stocks are underpriced or overpriced today, what would you do? So I have the regression, so through 2022. What's the T-bond rate right now? 3.3%, something like that? So you plug in your 3.3% minus 1.2%? See what you get as a predicted PE. You can be market strategist on a low budget. And guess what? You're going to do at least as well as those market strategists on a high budget because all that additional ammunition they bring to the table doesn't seem to add ratio of 25% and an expected growth rate of 10%. So the expected growth rate is over the next five years, maybe next three years. So it's not clearly defined, but let's say it's 10%. 25% divided by 10%. It's 25 times earnings divided by 10 gives me a PEG ratio of 2.5. So make sure you convert the percent into an absolute number, divide in growth companies into our choice, because if a company has a high enough growth rate, I'll buy it at 30 times earnings or 40 times earnings. Sounds good, right? And many people who continue to use peg ratios use the same rationale. Doesn't the growth come from the up-down lists? You already made that Faustian bargain to trust the data. In this case, even though there are biases, as long as the bias is cut in the same direction for every company, you can live with it because it's a relative statement. So that's part of what's driving the peg ratio. But I think the question of is growth neutralized, because that's basically the argument that people use with peg ratios. And now I can compare high growth companies with low growth companies. ratios. If I said as growth increases, what will happen to PE? At least in a sense of direction, you can say PE goes up. If I ask you the same question about PEG ratios, it's actually very difficult to answer the question because it's everywhere. So to kind of illustrate this, I'm going to go back to the hypothetical exampleG versus growth, and you're going to see a U-shaped graph where initially as growth goes up, the PEG ratio goes down, but then it starts going back up again, which makes it very difficult to control for when you're comparing across companies. So I went back to that same company that I used my else constant and changed my beta from 0.5 to 2.5. Across the board, what happens to peg ratios? They collapse. Last week, I was looking at an equity research report from a tech analyst. And the way he was picking stocks, he was looking at the peg ratio for his company. These are small tech companies and comparing them to the peg ratio moves. As risk goes up, peg ratios go down. As return on equities go up, peg ratios go up. So if I asked you at this point to find me a cheap stock on a peg ratio basis, you want a low peg ratio, you want low risk or high risk? You want low risk because high risk could explain away. And you want a high return equity. But then if I asked you, do you want a high growth rate or a low growth rate? Here's the problem you're supposed to do which is neutralize growth. They create this incredibly messy relationship with growth. So next time you see an equity research report with peg ratios, a lot of tech analysts still use peg ratios, And with growth, you got to look at what the peg ratio relationship is with growth within your sector. So if you have a range of companies from low growth to high growth in your sector, let the data tell you. Because I can't tell you in theory what should happen, because as you saw, the relationship kind of breaks down somewhere in the middle. So the problem with peg ratios, on a mispricing basis, you can get two thirds of the way there on growth and risk. less than book value, it must be cheap. And they make a link between book value and liquidation value that I've never quite got, but that is the underlying assumption. So a lot of equity research is still built upon, especially if it's old time value research is built upon price to book ratios and looking for stocks with low price to book ratios. So again, let's think about the questions you would need to ask when somebody tries to sell stock is cheap because it's trading at half a book value, my first question to you is going to be, what's its return equity? And 90% of the time, guess what you're going to get? It's either negative or a really low number. And I'm going to say, that explains the low price to book ratio. if that equation applies you know what's what kinds of companies trade at close to book value right if you're a company that has a return equity close to your cost of equity you should trade at roughly price to book roughly book value if your return equity is expected to be higher than the cost of equity should trade at well above book value remember we talked about competitive advantages and barriers to entry if you're in a business with significant competitive right? Is there an enterprise value analog to price to book? My numerator will then be market value of equity plus debt minus cash, enterprise value. My denominator then has to be book value of equity plus book value of debt minus cash, which is invested capital. If I made this enterprise value to invested capital, I know it's unfair because you haven't seen the algebra. What do you think my right-hand side of the equation is going to look like? When I did price to book, You earn well below your cost of capital, it should be below. It's an insight we use when we talked about growth, right? We said growth creates value only if you earn more than the cost of capital. It's just playing out as a market value relative to your book value in your company. P-ratio, peg ratio. Now, by the time you get to the fourth multiple, you can see I'm doing the same thing, right? I go back to the intrinsic value equation. I do the algebra. And I want advantage of going from PE ratios to EBITDA? More, less variation over time. So that's one. What else? So like top rates are more. First, remember when your earnings are negative, with the market. No, have a sense of, hey, what typical year you've heard about in CNBC, 18 times earnings. So when I give you eight times EBITDA, remember, you don't have a frame of reference. It looks cheap, right? You know what? As human beings, we go to a frame of reference or whatever we're comfortable with and we're more conversant and comfortable with P ratios. We know we shouldn't be doing this, but we're comparing eight times EBITDA because you could sell some real dogs using EBITDA-EBITDA multiples. 5 times EBITDA, that looks really cheap to me. So let's dig on EBITDA-EBITDA and let's see what drives EBITDA-EBITDA. So by now you know the trick, right? EBITDA-EBITDA is a firm value multiple. I went back to the simplest firm value multiple equation I could think of. Enterprise value is free cash for the firm next year divided by cost to capital minus the growth rate. Why did I not, when I did PE ratios, how come I never thought about tax rates? What goes in the denominator PE, earnings per share, which is already after taxes, if you have really high taxes, your income should reflect it, right? Here, I'm starting with a pre-tax number. And if you're starting with a pre-tax number, I have to ask you the question. I mean, let's say your tax rate is 100%. You know matters. You go to the denominator, holding all its concepts, the higher my cost of capital, the lower my EBITDA. So we have two companies, one in a safe country and the other in a risky country in the same business. I would expect my Argentine steel company to trade at lower EBITDA than my Chilean steel company, simply because it's a higher risk. And finally, growth matters. You don't want anything in that mix to explain away the low EBITDA. Again, think of it, you're saying, what chance do I have of finding something like this? No harm looking. It's a nice thing about screening big databases. You can say, I want every stock that trades at less than 10 times EBITDA has a tax rate less than 20%. Has a growth rate greater than 10. Don't get too carried away and say, I want a growth rate greater than 50%. You could try, but you'll get nothing coming through. So again, let's use... Yeah, go ahead. Remember, pricing, there is no should be, right? So here's the answer to the question. If you use adjusted EBITDA, use it for all your companies and hope and pray that the adjustment is not skewing you to its company, but it will, right? What's the adjustment that makes the biggest change to your adjusted EBITDA? What gets added back to the stated EBITDA to make the adjusted EBITDA is just one more intermediate stop, right? So you can use any intermediate stop as long as you remember to ask the question about everything that comes below that intermediate stop. Yes. asking some follow-up questions. But which ones you ask will depend on what your denominator is. But you're right, there are less questions to ask if your denominator is already netted. That's why you have fewer questions with the earnings per share than you do with EBITDA, right? And fewer questions with EBITDA than you do with revenues because as you move down the income statement, you're hoping that the cleaning up has already happened and you can just use that metric. So let's take a simplest, a discounted cash flow model, I'd be coming up with 8.24 times EBITDA. It's a fair amount. Intrinsic EBITDA. So you're not doing this to get that number. You're doing this because you want to ask what if questions. What if my tax rate were different? So if I change my tax rate for this company holding all its constant, if I change my tax rate from 0% to 50%, my EBITDA EBITDA. The second graph, I kept growth fixed and changed my net capex as a percentage of EBITDA. So the less I invest in net capex for a given growth rate, the higher my EBITDA EBITDA, which is another way of saying if I have a higher return on capital in my new investments, I should be willing to pay a much higher multiple, but because it will tell me what variables I should be controlling for with this multiple. So let me do a final multiple, which is revenue multiple, because I want to bore you with the algebra because by now you get it. Equity multiples go back to dividend discount model, payments and principal payments with the value of the debt. But if nobody's holding the equity, there is no firm, right? And tax rates never hit 100%. They converge towards 100%. The highest corporate tax rate now is 32%, 34%, I think. So we're numb. But I'd say, so that's why I push it towards 100. But at 100, just to show an extreme example, your equity value goes to zero. Let's from its cash balance. If I wanted a P-E ratio, I really want to take the interest income from cash out of the numerator, which is close to zero then, and take the cash out of the numerator. Apple was actually trading at about seven to eight times earnings. So even for companies with no debt, there's an argument that using an enterprise value to earnings, or in operating margin. If it's price to sales, if you insist on using price to sales, what margin should I be looking at? Net profit margin. Basically, it'll be net income divided by sales. So at least be internally consistent. Everything else looks exactly the same as it did for every other EV multiple. So if you told me a company is cheap because it's trading at 0.3 times revenues, compute the EV to sales ratio for your company with your current margin, which is high because you have a strong brand name, and then I was able to compute the EV to sales for your company with that pricing power removed, I should be able to value the brand name. So I'm going to close with an example. This is from 15, 20 years ago. The numbers are dated. Somebody went through this class, went to work at Coca-Cola, probably because they liked to drink all the Coke about 80 billion and one of the people in the room the head marketing honcho puts up his hand and said you forgot something very important he said what did i forget he's not maybe i forgot a beverage or a geography what did i say he said you've forgotten the fact that coca-cola is one of the most valuable brand names in the world i said okay so what do you want me to do he said you shared at least a 20 premium to the 80 billion i said why he said because that's what we do at about the taste. Let's face it, Coca-Cola doesn't taste the same across the world. I live in San Diego, so I can drink the Mexican version of Coca-Cola, which actually uses sugar rather than corn syrup. I prefer it. It's a very different taste. So this has nothing to do with taste. So what did he end there? He said, I don't believe you. So what happened? You get into an argument all the way down. The value that you get with the pricing margin dropped to generic levels is 15.4 billion. You want me to add a brand name premium? I gave you a $64 billion premium. You don't think it's enough. Tell me why. Maybe I'm underutilizing or you're underutilizing your brand name. But if you do things right, it should already be in there. is enough to thinking about brand name back. Why does only the brand name influence the operating margin? What other number would you change? Cost of capital is a cost of capital based on macro factors. There's no company specific component to it. question. So you use the same revenue? Yeah, because I'm trying I'm not comparing Coca-Cola to Cod. I'm comparing Coca-Cola with a brand name to Coca-Cola without a brand name. Okay, so why you use the same reinvestment rate? Because I don't use the same reinvestment rate. I have a lower return on capital. So I have a higher reinvestment rate to get the same growth rate. it does. The alternative is I could have kept the growth rate at 10.42%, but then I'd have to reinvest almost 250% to get to that same growth rate. So there is still like some constant. So there are three variables. Two of them can change. The other one is computed. So in this case, I'm letting the return on capital change. advertising, which translates into higher sales capital ratio. So you might give them a lower margin, a higher sales capital ratio, and the value that you get then, the difference between the two values will be the brand name value. So here I've isolated everything into the margin, but I could have let the sales capital be different for, if you have a generic sort of company, and I can have a different reinvestment rate. brand name with coca-cola and with apple when i do this that difference in value is because of brand name it's because of the operating system it's because of styling it's all of their different competitive advantages then if you said how much of this difference is because of brand name i don't know that's the reason i think we shouldn't be actually valuing things because you're trying to separate things that cannot be separated. Thank you. Yes. I have a question on the last slide. Yeah. So you said I will not be in speed until I win. So a higher sales to capital. So if you're picking between a high margin, low sales strategy and a low margin, high sales strategy, two things will change. One is the margin, obviously. The second is the sales to capital ratio will be lower in the first strategy and higher in the second one. You multiply the two, you know what you get? You get the return on capital. So, you know, whichever strategy ends up giving you the higher return on capital, you go with that one because that's going to be the net effect that drives that.",
