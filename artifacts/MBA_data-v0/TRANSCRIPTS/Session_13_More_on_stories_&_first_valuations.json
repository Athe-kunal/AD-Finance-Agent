  "text": " and project this is yes Okay, folks. Just a reminder, if you want feedback on your evaluation next Friday by 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock, somewhere around there. start of the class test, I'm going to start with something that I get pushed back on, which is people are used to using Excel spreadsheets to value companies, you know, and most people who do valuation, that's what they do. Their argument is, why are you wasting your time? I don't have to tell a story. I'm just going to send you an Excel spreadsheet. So let's say you're dealing with somebody like that. And I'm the person, I'm sending you a cost of capital of 7%, which is well below the industry average. So all you see is a spreadsheet with numbers. I'm going to ask you questions about what has to be true about this company for this spreadsheet to actually make sense. So go along with me. First, is a company of value is likely to be a small company or a big company? And what is it that makes you believe it's a small company? I want to go for this growth. It's got to be coming from taking market share away from somebody else. It's going to be very difficult to then argue I'm going to have twice the margin. So that combination must mean that I'm talking about a total market that's growing because that gives me some leeway. Am I telling you something about the competitive advantages that this company has? The fact that I'm reinvesting very little and have high margins must mean there's some barrier to entering something special about my company. 15 billion, a 50% growth rate makes those revenues into 250 billion, can this company pull it off? Every valuation tells a story. Most of the time, the story is implicit. Even the person doing the spreadsheet is not aware they're telling the story. And that's a very dangerous place to be. So what I'm trying to get you to do on that, Federal Reserve there's going to be banking changes regulations. Yeah, macro changes can affect to different degrees, right That's Lyft. But when you have 10 semiconductor companies on one count of the bad report, you might have to reassess the stories for the other nine because it's telling you something about the market, which might affect your story. Let me cut the long story short. Lots of things can change your story, which means your valuation is constantly in motion. Hopefully it won't be Silicon Valley Bank speed of motion, life cycle, right? Where companies go from young startups, babies, to toddlers, to teenagers, to mature companies, to old age, to death. Now, every valuation is a bridge between stories and numbers, stories and numbers. I want you to think about how that balance between which one you will use more will change as you go through the life cycle to create new characters and change the story but if the author dies in chapter 33 and you have to finish the last two chapters you don't have a whole lot of room to run your story matters more with young companies and less never ceases to matter but less as companies mature so those are things i implausible stories can happen but you better have a very good explanation for why that story holds and so you have a company with much higher margins than the rest of the sector and i say hey what is it doing you better have a good explanation this company has special protections against competition this is why the margins are but i'm going to give you what i what is my favorite device when i look at evaluation to rate and say that 23% growth rate for Spotify should really be 21%, you're assuming that I know things I really have no idea about. I don't know the growth rate for every company. I'm not even close. So here's what I'm going to do. So let's say you turn in your valuation. I'm going to look at your revenue growth rate. Let's say it's a high number. I look at your cost of capital, let's say it's a US dollar-based valuation. I'll tell you what to do if it's a different currency. Remember I said the median cost of capital of a global company at the start of 2023 was about 9%? We'll check your cost of capital. If you had high growth and high reinvestment, what should I expect to see as a cost of capital? A number higher than the 9% or lower than the 9%? High growth, high reinvestment, usually higher risk, right? and it produces something that's non-discretionary, which must explain the low cost of capital. Basically, whenever you have a mismatch, I'm going to look at your story much more closely. When you have a match, I'm going to just say, this is an upbeat story, a downbeat story, but internally it's consistent. But it probably basically takes your valuation to that triangle and say, does this valuation make sense? size of the car service business in the Bay Area. People were using car service for things that they didn't even think about. Because my story was essentially not that ambitious, the defense I have to play is actually much easier because I can say, look, they're already doing it. They're an urban car service company. They're attracting new users. Look at the Bay Area. They have local networking benefits. Look how quickly they grow. automated driving company because they're i'm not saying it's impossible you have to now do the hard i shouldn't be doing that work for you it's not my job if your teller is selling me the valuation say hey you know what let me justify that for you you have to come up with a story that once in a while and i want to think like an investor you will hear a story and you really who drops out of Stanford. Who does that? What's the admission rate at Stanford unless you're a synchronized swimmer or something getting through the side door? It's like minus 3%. She gets in and drops out. This is a sophomore at 19 to start a new business. She's another tech geek starting another software business. Here's what makes the story different. It's not a he, it's a she. Usually it's some software engineer dropping out in about two months we have a 6 a.m appointment think about it say okay i'll take it you get up at 4 a.m you get there at 6 a.m and they make you wait till 9 why because they can't finally at 9 a.m the door opens and the nurse comes out she looks like nurse ratchet from one flew over the cuckoo's nest she says come on in you go000 to take two buckets of your blood to feed Dracula and tell you nothing's wrong with you. Don't you want this business to be disrupted? That's what this 19-year-old is going to do. She's going to create a blood testing business where she takes two drops of your blood, not two buckets, in a nanotainer. Not really, because this is the true story of Elizabeth Holmes. 19-year-old who drops out of Stanford, starts a company called Theranos, does exactly what I described, and becomes incredibly successful. Because by the middle of 2015, Theranos was priced, I shouldn't have used the word valued, at about $9 billion. And it wasn't just VCs. Some of the biggest VC the price to 9 billion, but I was wrong because in October of 2015, a Wall Street Journal reporter decides to ask that question and the results are actually in the public domain because you've got to get blood test approved. So he went to the FDA and says, Theranos has been approved for these 32 tests. be high we can't quite tell initially of course when this article came out in the wall street journal there are no certain decision they said you have no idea what you're doing but over the next six months the entire company unraveled six months later you know what that that number looked like it was down to zero elizabeth hol the first women billionaires under the age of 30 who did not get there through, you know, being a social influencer. So it was a big deal. There are people who bring their daughters to work. I said, let's say the June of 2015, you'd gone to that thousand person meeting in New York City and the celebrated entrepreneur gets on there runaway stories. It's very difficult to ask questions because everybody in the room so wants the story to be true that nobody it's like the emperor's new clothes. Nobody wants to ask the question because of what it might expose. Now one other final question I asked was, there's a board of directors, even though it's a private company, why weren't they asking the question? So I took a look at the board and it's right there. your board call a board meeting put a pillow in front of each seat just in case they have to take a nap have a backup ambulance you never know what can happen you're never going to get questioned but runaway stories take off in every few years you see one of these companies take off and you say why aren't people asking questions the answer is everybody in that ecosystem so wants a story to a charismatic storyteller. What causes charismatic storytellers to eventually fall off the pedestal? You start to realize, hey, they're lying about this. How come? This is how televangelists, you know, they got to the top and then next thing you know, they're having an affair on the side. The whole thing comes unraveling. This is how stories unravel. That storyteller, all of a sudden you start to say, maybe he or she is lying. And then you start digging and you recognize the story the idea, but to make sure that there is a business behind the idea. And that's why this is so unhealthy is you're letting something get way too big without testing the basic premise of, I mean, WeWork was a horrifically bad business. Why? Especially in the aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank, you should see exactly what WeWork was doing that made them such a horrifically bad business. What's a WeWork business? They go to the middle of the city, in the company. If you're not talking about it, how come nobody's asking questions? And of course, six weeks later, eight weeks later, the value dropped to zero. So let's stay on this concept of say, I can conquer the market. I'm going to start a company. You seek out venture capitalists. Let me ask you the same question about venture capitalists. Are they confident, careful people or overconfident, risk-taking people? Europe, each of whom thinks that they can conquer the market. You think, so what? What does overconfidence mean? When you project out your revenues and your margins, you're going to project out too high a number because you think you are much smarter than everybody else. And if you think about this happening in a hundred different places collectively, you see what's going to happen, right? The collective valuation across a hundred companies is going electric cars right lucid rivian every company this is going after a big market therefore we'll give it a big back i actually tested this with the online advertising market about seven years ago at the peak of its glory facebook and google were doing incredibly well snap had just gone public and every one of them you know we with the total value of five, I'm sorry, breaking revenues of 682 billion. So based on how these companies were being priced, the revenues 10 years from now would have been 682. You think so what? The entire, the advertising market in 2015 was $500 billion. You say, well, it can grow. Okay, it can grow. It's not that individual groups think that. So if you take each individual group is, are you guys being rational? They say, oh, we're being completely rational. But that's the nature of overconfidence, right? This and this is how you create bubbles. And eventually the bubble burst. And of course, after the bubble burst, everybody wrings their hands. What do they say? Oh, never again. Never again. It's such a terrible experience. In fact, I wrote a piece that still gets me backlash. I said, what's wrong with bubbles? you know what the heck is that i remember when i used to make a plane trip reservation i had to walk into this office sit across this desk from this all-knowing person with the only terminal on the face of the earth that i want to get from new york to chicago and they'd look me and he says, you know what, our markets are not that, there's not much trading going on, there's not much activity. We'd like more activity on market, more people trading in the Singapore. And I said, okay. And I said, but if you do that, you have to be willing to accept the fact that it's going to come with volatility and overreaching and bubbles. And he said, no, no, we don't like that in Singapore. I said, that's a problem. cap of the company is equal to the value that you get. So it'll spin through and it'll say, revenues have to be this. And I did this with every company using exactly the spreadsheet you have. So it's actually a very simple exercise in any Excel spreadsheet, solving for any one variable that you want to back up. One final example before we leave this space. Now, I'm not much of a consumer of equity research reports other than for laughs. And analyst. I won't name his name, but he's been following Tesla for a while. You see his name every time Tesla gets reported. And he has put out an equity research report, the big buy and a value per share of $600 per share. Curious. What does he see in Tesla that I don't? So I pick up the equity research report. It's 250 pages long, like reading a creative novel, lots of pictures, lots of graphs, and you know what the point was. And then on. I did that over the next 15 years. I added up the earnings and the free cash flow. That difference is what is collectively being reinvested over the next 15 years. And I found he was reinvesting almost nothing. That explained the extra $450 per share. How many cars is Tesla selling? 24,000 at the base year. How many cars is he projecting Tesla will sell? at your D.C.F. I decided to stay with this terminology just in case you'd be confused. And I have some questions. He said, I can't answer your questions. I said, why not? He said, because I don't do the number crunching. I have a team that does this. And I said, you have an entire team churning out this time of D.C.F. It's a team of six. Okay, I'll call you next week. So a week later, and he said, before he hangs up, he says, you're not going to write about this on your blog or anything, right? I said, not for the next week, but then all bets are off. they put him in front of the uh on the phone and i really feel sorry i'm a smart kid i'd lead him through and he very quickly gets it i said what happened he said it slipped my mind so what slipped your mind capex stuff yeah because he said this is what i did i took last year's numbers and last year tesla had capex very close to depreciation i just grew things out straining I watched it on the flight with him because I was in Florida. We went to Disney World together. So, you know, if you've ever seen the movie, one of the things that I remember about the movie, and I saw it when I was much, much younger, one of the things I struggled with was this movie, Willy Wonka chocolates are in every store. But there's only one factory. It's a very inefficiently laid out factory. It's like chocolate rivers running through it. Not exactly what Henry Ford would require in an assembly line. gone. 200,000 cars, who cares? Oompa Loompas, they can generate 1.1 million cars from that same factory. He didn't take my advice, but we should create a new class of valuations called Oompa Loompa, we refer to it as Willy Wonkitis valuations, where you see big growth numbers and nothing being reinvested to create that growth. It's not magical. You can't produce stuff without putting money back. It's actually fun when you start looking at DCFs and market. I went to Google search and said, size of the urban car service market. I'm very sophisticated the way I look. It's just being facetious. Nothing shows up. You know why? Because in 2013, who dominated the urban car service market? Taxicabs across the world, all splintered, privately owned. It's different in automobiles, right? Automob even get the number. I doubled it. I came up with a hundred billion. Remarkably precise, right? But to show you how these numbers percolate their way back into the public domain as facts, I put the a hundred billion as my total market. A year later, I went back and said, maybe there's a better estimate. Let me try Google search again. Sides of the urban car service market. Guess what shows up as the number one search result? market. I have to decide what market share. What did I describe as Uber? Local networking benefits, right? Which meant that you could have a dozen different ride-sharing companies in different parts of the world dominating each part. So you know what that effectively translates into. Nobody's going to have a 50% market share of the total market. I gave Uber a 10% market share, huge by car service standards in 2013, but I capped it at 10%. my discounted cash flow valuation, I need a discount rate, right? And how, you know, we spent, what, eight sessions on betas, risk-free rates, risk premium. I ignored all eight sessions. The heck am I doing this to me? To begin with, you think this valuation is going to be made or broken by what my cost of capital is? Zero chance. This is not even on my top 10 list of words. My total market itself is such a fuzzy number. What the heck am I doing getting the cost of capital to the second decimal point? So here's what I did. That's a failure. You know why? Because venture capitalists have priced it at 17 billion. In a sense, it's too large to fail. Remember, when venture capitalists write things down, they have to show it in their portfolio, so they'll supply capital to the company to keep it going until it gets to its absolute last legs. Every part of my story has become a number. That's the craft part of valuation. So when you do your assumptions, I want you to think word my here, and you're going to see in a minute why I use that. The value that I got push for the company was $6 billion. Do you remember the original Wall Street Journal story that drew me to Uber? That venture capitalists had put $3 billion into the company and priced it at $17 billion, right? But she's a journalist. Cut us some slack. I said, yes, I do know their price of the company at 17 billion. So how do you explain the 17 billion? I said, I don't have to. I didn't pay it. I've never felt the urge to explain what other people pay. You know how much frustration this creates when you're trying to explain what other people do? Just let it go. It's not your money. Somebody wants to pay $50,000 for Bitcoin. But maybe when he says buy, you sell short, and maybe the whole thing will work out. But the fact that you turn over your decision-making essentially means you're at the mercy of other people's decisions. And this isn't rocket science. my uber valuation i created that story sheet because once i finish an excel spreadsheet all the numbers get transported to story sheet and they're blank rows next so it says revenue growth and take your number put it there and put a blank row next to it so basically that's where you that way rather than tell a story that's disconnected your story is very focused to individual inputs in this part of my story explains my valuation. I'm not a ride-sharing specialist. I don't know much about this business. In fact, I could say this about pretty much any company I value. I don't know much about infrastructure companies, but that doesn't stop me valuing Adani. I don't know much about the electric car business, but that doesn't stop me from valuing Testran. Or another way of saying this, to explain things like the hot hand in basketball. You've heard of this. Now you start shooting. You have a hot hand. You should keep shooting. So you take something like this. Is that true? So the editor of 538.com, after I post my blog, calls me and he says, you know what? Readers would be interested in something like this because there's statistics and there's numbers. I said, sure, carry it. They take the entire polls with the numbers carried. The second place I got a call from was a site for Uber and Lyft drivers. There are 3 million of those people now around the world, so it's a big population. And the person who runs the site said, I'd love to carry this because our drivers are very interested in what the company is actually doing. Same post, carried in four different places. And I'm glad it got picked up, because I get very different kinds of feedback from each one. On the 538 site, here's the kind of question I ask. I get asked. people absolutely despised it. Their reaction was, how dare you value one of ours with your D.C.F. We don't do that at Silicon Valley. So half the comments, I think there were 400 comments in the TechCrunch version of my post, half of them were insults, most of which I didn't even understand. One called me, you DCF guy. What does that even mean? Good thing, kept it. That's what they told their investors. We keep 20%. I got an Uber driver from LA who said, you know what? That's what they tell investors. But let me explain to you what's happening in LA. I used to drive for Lyft. Uber paid me $3,000 to switch. Now Lyft is offering me $5,000 to switch back. I feel like a free agent without a contract. He said, by the time they do all of this stuff, I'd be surprised if they kept more than 7% or 8% of the fare. at Credit Suisse, first Boston as an equity research analyst in the 90s. So he actually knows the valuations. That's perhaps one of the few VCs who understands valuation. And it's an email from him. And he was as partner of Benchmark Capital. Benchmark was one of the first to invest in Uber. They invest in Uber as a billion dollar company. And he was in the board of directors for Uber. And he was rumored to be part of my story. He said, Uber is not a car service company. It's a logistics company. Notice how words have consequences? What can logistics companies do? They can do car service. They can do delivery. They can do moving. He said, it's not Honda Civic. It's more than enough for me. But the insults are kind of, no. So I finished up. 15 minutes later, I emailed him back, still sitting in Munich airport. I said, I just read your story. Uber, it's fascinating. Do you want me to put a number on your story? He said, what are you talking about? I said, I have the Excel spreadsheet open here. You've told me a big story. I can convert that story into numbers. He said, be my guest. So here's what I did. market and a global market, global network. It's 53 billion. I sent this back to Bill, still sitting in Munich airport. This flight is taking forever to board. I said, do you like this more? He said, a lot. He said, oh, by the way, that 20% share, that's probably not long for the world. It's more like 10%. I almost told him that Uber driver in LA already told me that. Is Uber a car service company, logistics company, transportation company? Or is it some kind of on-demand company? What's an on-demand company? Whatever you want, they will deliver it to you. You want to go to the bathroom, you're too lazy to get out of the bed, they'll carry you to the bathroom, charge you a fee, right? The closest I've seen to an on-demand company is a company called Go-Check. It's an Indonesian, I won't even call it a car service company. Go-Check, basically, let's say an Avengers movie is opening tomorrow can be less than a billion or over 90 billion, depending on not all of these stories equally plus. But what I'm saying is when you have young companies, you will have disagreed. Why? Because you're in chapter two of the book. You're saying, what will of the company went from almost a billion down to 200 million because you can't protect your data. Nobody's going to be on your side. Story breaks out when something happens and you say, you know what? The story is done. Luckily, that doesn't happen very often. But when it does happen, your value can essentially go to zero or drop substantially. leveling off. Pretty much everybody wants a smartphone, pretty much has one now. It's going to be a more mature business. So it's a slow growth cash machine. And it's only the last two years that I've created a second leg of this Apple services business adding on value. I told them to save some. But once in a while, you might get a narrative change where you look at a company and it that's what I look for. Is there something in this report that will lead me to shift my story? Cause that's what's going to shift my valuation significantly. I couldn't care less with the immediate earnings per share estimate by 2 cents or 7 cents. Those are not the things that change the story. So how many companies have we actually valued in this class so far? Outside, I mean, in the class itself. with each company i'm going to tell the story behind my valuation what's driving so i want to kind of make that almost part of the process and with each valuation i'm going to focus on a specific aspect of the company there's some general assumptions okay let's start easy first company i'm going to value the company called con take you through the tests I ran to decide that this was a good candidate for a stable growth dividend discount. First, I said, is the company paying dividends like a stable company? So if you have a dividend payout ratio of 5% or 10%, for God's sakes, don't use a stable growth dividend discount model because your company's paying out too little in dividends. A mature, slow growth equity at the beta 1.8. And the answer was, that looks pretty reasonable. In fact, the cost of equity was about 7.7%. And so the actual return equity was also 7.7%. Are you surprised by that? What's the regulated utility? You know what a regulated utility is required to do, right? in the cost of equity, 7.7%, and the growth rate in perpetuity of 2.1%. That's it. All you need is three numbers. Dividends last year, cost of equity, growth rate, and the value per share you get is $42.30. The stock was actually trading at $40.76. Am I surprised that my values close the price? This is as close to a bond as you're going to get in the stock market. You get a big dividend. So let's say you're at an interview and people say, oh, it looks like you can do a DCF valuation, but we do target prices here. How would you convert a DCF value into a target price in your cryptocurrency? Want to try? Yeah, current value. Grow it out. By what, at what rate? they're expected to turn building it up. And in fact, if you buy the stock today at $40 and 76 cents, and your value is right, and you hold the stock for a year, and the market adjusts to your value, you're not going to go from 40, 76 to 40 to 30. You're going to go to the $44 and 31 cents, which is your target price. So get comfortable. Once you've got a DCF value, you can give me a target price, one year out, five years out. take a second valuation. Get a 3M. What does 3M do? Extremely boring things that make a lot of money. The guy who invented the post-it note should get a Nobel Prize, right? Look at them all over the place. In spite of all the digital age we live in, I see post-it notes stuck all over the place. So I valued 3M on September 12th of 2018. of markets or it could collapse now, the world could come to an end. But I did not. So my original valuation of 3M reflects the fact that I don't see the storm coming. And I valued it as a company that basically earned a tremendous return on capital. That post-it note is actually patented as high growth. It's a valuation of an upbeat growing company. It's still a big company, but it's a growing company with strong barriers. and widened, even though the rating hadn't changed. So the first thing that happened, your cost of capital changes, your risk-free rate goes down. I did allow for the fact that in the near term, this is also going to slow the economy down by bringing that growth rate down. Nothing fundamentally, if you look at the data, nothing in the data changed, but I have to reflect the changes going on around. I hope and pray you don't have a market crisis between today and May 8th. I remember March of 2020, this class was in the, we were right in the middle of class and COVID hit. This was a peak COVID pandemic. And people said, should we still finish the project? I said, heck yes, you have to finish the project. I can't just let you get out of here. I said, we can't value companies. I said, why not? There's a crisis around us. Just because there's a crisis doesn't mean there's no such thing as value. It might have a much lower value today than you did four weeks ago before the crisis. I was trying to close the free cash flow equity and see if we can form GAAP again. And so I managed to do it if I don't consider it GAAP. Otherwise the difference is exactly. When you did free cash flow equity, you have this. So which one is higher? See, free cash flow equity is higher by the cash that I add back. When I discount free cash flow reform, I subtract the market value of that, and I subtract cash. So you're saying, so where was the cash when you did your free cash flow equity? Exactly. So where's the interest income from cash? See, the way this works out, you do a free cash flow equity evaluation tell you when you shouldn't add back cash. You start with the actual stated net income and you work down to free cash. That's because cash income is included. Exactly. Then you don't add back cash. It's a very sloppy way of dealing with cash because you're discounting that back at the cost of equity. If I adjust net income and I subtract the cash income, I can add back cash at the end. As long as you have no cross-high interest. Cross, okay. You mean from minority interest? free cash flow and work the way you did you're doing exactly that you're cleaning you're doing just the income in the operating assets you value the equity in the operating assets and do exactly what you did for free cash flow then i have to have that at that beta for cash no beta that we use is actually just a beta for the business for the business without considering that i remember in some cases it was just for just okay if you use a dividend discount model you have to adjust the Oh, go ahead. Yeah. About the mechanics of the. I found one, I go to like update it like later on, like the share price stopped updating. And I don't know if you have any. What do you mean share price? The value. Yeah, the value. So did you check the iteration box? I believe that. Initially, that's my. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was there during Thanksgiving break. My husband is from Dallas. So I go to Dallas. I know I do. Maybe I don't pay for a workout. Yeah. What a fascinating thing. It's like a lot of people. What about you? What if it's my year? Yeah. Well, I think the example of that analysis you did of like the solver function that you mentioned.",
