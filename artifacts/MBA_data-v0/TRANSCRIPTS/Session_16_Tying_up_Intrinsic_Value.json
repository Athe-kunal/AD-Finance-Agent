  "text": " there is these upgraded corporate finance places could you put them. I'll let you know when they're graded. You can come pick them up. The solutions will be posted when they're done grade, when I'm done grading them. I do have three quizzes I gave today. So it's first in, first out. So I'm going to grade the finance quizzes that I gave this morning first, and then I will turn my attention to you and then the undergraduate evaluation. So if it takes a little regulators and you don't trust banks to be run by sensible people, you can no longer just discount dividends. Everybody get that intuition? Because when you discount dividends, you aren't trusting. You're trusting managers to pay out what they can afford to. You're trusting regulators to keep risk in line. So in 2009, I started re So the way I decided to rethink this was I said, okay, I have to rethink what reinvestment for a bank is. And anytime I have a question about reinvestment, the way I like to think about it is for a bank to grow, what does it have to invest in? You might say it has to build more branches, but that's a very 20th century view of a bank, right? And when was the last time you actually walked into a a bank, because I'm assuming it's a going concern, and to grow if that's what I'm putting. So my definition of free cash flow structure to value a bank. And it's a bank that I think of as one of those characters in a horror movie that keeps going back into the basement with the chainsaw loud there, and then blood comes spurting out. And it keeps doing it over and over again. Stolzschibank. This is from a 2016 post a billion and a half, two billion. And you could throw in a trading loss in there to add to the losses. So every time you lose money, what happens to your book equity? It declines, right? Normally for a traditional company, say who cares? But for a bank, when book equity declines, your regulatory capital is also going to get impacted. book equity, but bankers allow these little loopholes. You have debt that looks like equity, we'll let you count it in, but the reality, it's book, it's residual claims. That ratio is down to 12.15%. Your first reaction is look at that ratio, and let's be honest, most of us don't sit around thinking about tier one capital ratios. It's not healthy. So when you look at that ratio and say, what does that even mean? The only way to get%. And they need to get there. And I did this valuation with rumors floating around that Deutsche might be taken into receivership. Remember, with traditional companies, you talk about bankruptcy and default. With a bank, you can't do that because there are depositors. You can't liquidate a bank. That's why when banks get in trouble, what happens then? maybe it'll come out, maybe it won't. But you could see that, but to add to the problem, Deutsche was losing billions of dollars. It had a net loss of $8.9 billion in the most recent year coming into the valuation. And it didn't look like the losses would go away for the next two or three years. So not only are they undercapitalized, they're a money losing bank. So I put my optimist hat on. Let's face it, if you're a pessimist, you look at this and say, this is a basket case. that Deutsche can do is make its cost of equity. So what about excess returns? With Deutsche, talking about excess returns sounds like an oxymoron. I mean, this is a bank that can't make money. And it's going to take time. So over the next 10 years, if you look at my return on equity, here's what you will see. My return on equity starts at minus 13.7%, and over time climbs to 9.44%. That sounds awfully precise, 9, they're going to move in the right direction. They have an expected loss of $5.1 billion. But remember, they need to fix this tier one capital problem. Otherwise, the regulators are going to step in. So in year one, you notice that I have to make an investment in regulatory capital of almost $6.6 billion. You add those two numbers up. My expected free cash flow equity in year one for Deutsche is about $11.7 billion. am assuming they will be able to do that. What could intervene? First is if the depositors catch wind of the fact that they're in trouble and they start withdrawing deposits, there is no year two or year three. It's going to spin very quickly out of control. So you've got to do this without panicking people, which is Deutsche, thank God, was zero, with a negative free cash flow equity because they have to actually raise fresh equity to become a going concern. Those free cash flows to equity get discounted back a high cost of equity. So here's the combination. I'm allowing for a recovery in income as negative return equity becomes positive. I'm allowing them to dig out of the hole and get their tier one capital caught up to where it needs to be. And I'm attaching a high cost of equity to this because I know it's a risky bank. And eventually, as they get to steady state, I allow it to go to the median cost of equity. That's where the 9.44% comes in. force it out of business and get somebody to take it over. It's one thing to get First Republic acquired by somebody else. It's an entirely different problem trying to get Deutsche. So you know what's going to happen, right? They're going to put Band-Aids and patchwork because nobody has an incentive here to push it over the edge. Nobody. J.P. Morgan doesn't want First Republic to go under for selfish reasons, because once one bank goes under, you can see what happens, right? got it back, send it again. I know there are a handful of you valuing banks, but most of you luckily have picked bigger banks, but if you pick a smaller bank, the valuation you do now will give you a lower value of equity than the valuation you did three weeks ago, even if every single number looks the same. Because in a sense, that's what a crisis does. It makes every bank more vulnerable to this trust failure, and then the whole thing starts to unravel. of messy to dig up and bring it into the analysis. How would I bring it in? I've got to bring it in either into the cash flows, the growth or the risk, right? And to me, the most logical place to probably bring it in is to attach it to the cost of equity. So up till now, I've estimated cost of equity based on your tier one capital ratios, are they low or high? And maybe I need to bring a second dimension in that if you have a duration mismatch, I need to start using a much higher cost of equity with you as a bank.'s really strict, they might ask you to make up the whole thing next year. I actually didn't finish the story. The value per share I get with the failure rate is 2067. The stock was trading at 1333. Ask me the question. I bought. And I mean, it's one of those things I look back and say, what was I thinking? I did. But I actually got lucky in the sense that of my money back. And at this stage, it's more option than anything else. If something good happens, I'll take it and be icing on the cake. If something bad happens, because give me something else to abuse Deutsche over in future years. But if you're valuing a bank, again, the traditional model, dividend discount model, start with that. It might work for your bank. But I hadn't valued too many payment processing companies when I valued MasterCard and Visa a long time ago. But think of how a payment processing company's business works, right? Every time somebody does a transaction on the platform and spends money, you get a piece of that. It's called a take rate. So when you look across credit cards, go back, forget about FinTech, look at MasterCard, Visa, American keeps, but basically that becomes a big metric. So in a value Paytm, I constructed my valuation by looking at gross merchandise. There's a story you can tell. Paytm is on 330 million phones in India. That's a big selling point. Look at how many people. So there's transactions going through. The only problem is they give away almost everything for free, which is when you look at their take rate, translates into a take rate of 0.6 from 0.7 to 2%. So rather than try to forecast revenues, which is an aggregated number, I forecast out the transaction value and the take rate. The product of those two gives a revenue. I'm telling a big story for Paytm, but my big story is built around monetizing their user base. And over time, as they monetize their people who think that the objective of a business is to have the most users you can have in your platform. And they seem almost unable to do this, which I made the mistake of installing the Paytm app on my phone because I'd never used Paytm in my life. It's an Indian app, but I applied. Every day, I started getting a dozen notifications from Paytm on free stuff I could get. a non-Indian company, let's say Indian financial service businesses are thrown open and you want to enter the Indian market. You know what I would do, right? Your MasterCard, you want to grow your business in India among low-income users, just go buy Paytm. You're getting it at a bargain basement price. You get 330 million users and hopefully you can take care of building the take rate. This is a company where the value of control is immense. If somebody can take over the company clients is going to show up as lower cash flows if you don't fix the problem. So financial service companies, it's messier than regular companies, but I think it's worth the effort. And the problem here is to value a bank, you need to invest in understanding banking regulation. I know it's not the most fun thing to do. I don't see a way around it. and ask you, what are your cash flows from existing assets? And you give me your income statement and your financial statements. What's the biggest challenge I have? You've taken your biggest capex, treated it as an operating expense. In other words, I have to go through your financial statements and redo them to actually get a sense of how much are you making? How much are you reinvesting? A lot more work, right? It's easier to deal with a manufacturing company where things are at least accounted for, right? When I ask you, what's the value of growth? intangible assets. But the way in which you get the information takes a lot more work because you have to redo the accounting. That's basically what you're doing. The income statement, the balance sheet are being redone because you don't trust the accountants. When I talk about companies with intangible assets, I'm talking about almost all of the technology companies. I think the accounting is just completely screwed up. All of the pharmaceutical companies. In fact, you could argue that this is a bigger issue or this is more the rule than the exception that the accounting accounting numbers that Amgen reported. So the accountants are telling me that Amgen makes about $5.07 billion in operating income. They give me an invested capital. I adjusted for R&D. What does that mean? I capitalize R&D, which changes my income, my invested capital. And the case of Amgen, when I did that, my numbers changed pretty dramatically. My operating income went from $5 billion to $7.4 billion. My invested capital, why waste my time, right? We do this because it's going to change the value. So I valued, I got the value per share. Take a look at the bottom line there. I get a value per share of $43 when I value Amgen and the value goes out. You know what I'm learning? That at least over this, their history, Amgen has done value creating R&D. What does that mean? They invest money in R&D or they expend it. They've converted into higher revenues and higher profits. And I'm capturing that effect in my value. I did the same thing for Merck at the time that I valued Amgen. In other words, I valued it without the R&D adjustment, with in R&D and you keep saying that's good, I'm going to increase their value, and half of them are wasting that R&D, you're in fact pushing up value and you should be pushing down value. So when you capitalize these expenses like R&D, that's effectively why you're doing it is to capture that. I think 18% in 2020. That's not a way a mature company behaves, right? But what's causing the operating income for Aramco to be all over the place? It's oil prices. It's not that they're producing more or less oil. It's oil prices going up and down. You see where I'm going? Even the most mature commodity and cyclical companies will have volatile earnings. Their earnings will go up. So at any given year, you can see a 20% jump in earnings or a 15% drop company. And when you think about risk in these companies, and let's keep the ESG issue out, because that's going to also come into play here. The risk in these companies comes from the fact that as your oil prices go up and down, you could go from being a very safe company one year, because the oil price is $100, and the same company two years later could be on the verge of disaster if oil prices drop to $30. I mean, let me Because oil prices are such a big factor, you're going to be tempted to play oil price prognosticator. For God's sakes, don't. Because I'll save you the trouble. Let's assume that you expect oil prices, it's your view, you've got this crystal ball you've looked at, to go up 15% a year for the next five years. I'll save you the trouble. forecast oil prices. They exist to make soothsayers look good. Why are you messing with this? And if you do, you can already see I have a problem. Every valuation there will be a joint effect of what you think about the company and what you think about oil prices. What you think about the company and what you think about the economy. It's cyclical companies. I'm going to make a suggestion that's really difficult to follow and I have trouble following it. Try to be as macro neutral as you can be. I'll come back to this. It's Royal Dutch, one of the oldest oil companies around, a large integrated oil company. So this is a valuation I did of Royal Dutch in March of 2016 for their finance group in Houston. So I went in and they said, no, do you value Royal Dutch? At the time, oil prices had dropped significantly over the previous year from $70 down to $45. What do we usually start with as our base numbers? You look at the last 12 months, you look at revenues, operating income, cash flows. And what I said happened to oil prices over the previous year, they'd gone from $70 to $45, right? I have a problem here. The problem is if I take the trailing 12-month numbers, I will overvalue the company. Does everybody see why? Because those trailing 12-month numbers reflect an oil price of $70. If oil price of 45, I'm going to find the company are devalued, but I just plug the and I don't care. What are you going to do anyway? Come in and look at the terminal a little more carefully? This is a pure oil price play. But there's the other advantage from this graph. I ran a regression of revenues at Royal Dutch against the oil price. You're saying, what's that going to tell? Take a look at the coefficient of the regression, but the revenue, I'm sorry, it was a $40 oil price. The revenues at a $40 oil price. So I've lowered the revenues from the actual revenues, not because I want to punish the company, but you can see how it can cut the other way as well, right? Let's say that you're valuing an oil company in early 2021. You look at the last 12 months, they're going to look horrifically bad because you had COVID and oil prices dropped to $30 a barrel. But rather than use the trailing 12 month numbers, I'm going to look like. If oil prices go up, the stock's worth a lot. Oil prices go down, they're not worth very much. Thank you for letting me know, but not much is learned, right? So here's the last thing I did. Now, I used crystal ball, this add-on to Excel that you can get. What's the one number in this valuation that I'm uncertain about? It's the oil price, right? the default in crystal ball is 10 000 simulations and each time you run one you get a value and at the bottom i've actually bottom right hand corner i have actually a distribution of value at royal dutch and you're saying what do i do with that if i take the average value across the distribution i get roughly the same value that i got with my base case valuation saying i wasted my time to find that but i can also give you a distribution i can say this is the first quartile this is now have more information to make your decisions. Why haven't we always done this? 30 years ago, to run a Monte Carlo simulation would have cost you millions of dollars. You need a mainframe computer and you needed somebody who would actually program it for you. Today, it's free for you. Every one of your valuations, you can convert into a Monte Carlo simulation. So you can take a valuation, add crystal ball, and that revenue growth margin and sales to distribution and come up with the distribution value. So I'm going to leave you with that. And on Wednesday, we will be starting on packet two. There are a few more pages here that I want to complete, but we'll start with packet two, so make sure you print out packet two and bring it with you to class. We want to know the relationship between the price of oil and the value of your child. autocorrelation phrase is automatically driving autocorrelation in revenue. Two, still have two variables. So having an autocorrelation in one of the two variables doesn't stop you from computing. Autocorrelation becomes an issue if you use a time series to forecast the material. You're not forecasting this. You're not, I'm not forecasting. I'm just trying to find the relationship. If you're forecasting autocorrelation because it exaggerates these good or bad investments after oil prices have gone up or after oil prices have gone down, then I can run a very different kind of analysis. So look at returns in oil companies and regress them against oil price chains of previous year. Right. And see if there's a look. And if there's a look, then ask, you know, is this a potential way for me to make money? Because it looks like buying oil companies right after oil prices have dropped delivers higher should be, you know, all the price of a 40 instead of $60. Okay, makes sense. On the software, then my software, you can't, you're going to do it, you can buy is an add on. So if you're not adding parameters, you think your existing parameters, making a distribution. Yeah. And you can add as many distributions as you want. You can have only one output there. We can have as many input distributions. It allows you to put in correlations across the distribution.",
