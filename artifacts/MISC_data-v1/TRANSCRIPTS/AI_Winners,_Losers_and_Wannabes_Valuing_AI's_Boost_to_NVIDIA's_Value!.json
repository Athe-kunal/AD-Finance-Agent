{"text": " Hi, welcome back. It's been a while but I really didn't have anything interesting original to say anyway. But finally I think it's time for me to talk about something we all seem to be talking about which is AI and Chachi PT and how it's going to change our lives and how it's going to affect our investments. Now I'd like to start this session with a few confessions. The first is a boastful one which is my portfolio has held its? Now, since it's confession time, I'd like to add a couple more confessions before I get started. The next confession I'd like to make is the semiconductor business is still a bit of a mystery to me. There are people who have forgotten more about the semiconductor business in the last week than I know about it. So my knowledge is skinty. I look at the growth of semiconductors as a business by looking at the revenues for all semiconductor companies starting in 1987 going through 2023. You can see the growth for in billions of dollars going from less than 50 billion to close to 550 billion over the course of 36 years of history. You can also see that the bulk of the growth in terms of annual growth rate but that's more a blip than a trend. This is a growth business that is maturing, if not already mature. Now that's the bad news, it's maturing. The good news is this has always been a profitable business. In this graph, I look at different measures of profitability, starting with gross margin, operating margin, net margin. And for those of you familiar with my writings on margins, each captures a different component of the company two ways. One, it restates profitability. And you can see that with the margins adjusted for R&D. And I capitalize R&D at semiconductor companies with a five-year life, essentially arguing that over time. The semiconductor business is a cyclical business. You can see the cycles and the dips you see in margins and the recoveries again. So it's a profitable business with clear cycles driving profitability. So over time, there have been good periods where markets have loved semiconductor companies and periods where market cap has either stagnated or decreased over long periods. So revenue growth has slowed down. It's a profitable business with cycles and the market has a love-hate relationship. Finally, if you look at who the winners have been in this business, it's a shifting cast. not at the very top of the list. I don't think it aspires to be at the top of the list as we'll see as you look at the Nvidia model why revenues have not been the focus of this company. Now as the makers of chips have changed so have the users of chips. In the 1980s and through the 1990s the biggest user for computer chips was of course personal computers and computer related products. automotive companies are increasingly going to be consumers. Why? For chips into new cars and for automated driving when it's coming. And data storage is becoming a part. And data storage is where the AI business is going to be. So you can see that the user base for semiconductors chips is changing. And that may change the characteristics on the horizon when you start the century. And clearly, it's built up over time. The bulk of the buildup in revenues, though, happened in the last decade. And it came from NVIDIA being in the right place at the right time in two businesses that essentially became niche and profitable businesses for semiconductor chips. One was gaming and the other was crypto. head of the crowd for niche businesses are growing and it's managed to deliver revenue growth. Even more impressively, it's delivered this revenue growth with sustained margins. If you take a look at the operating margins between 2021 and 2023, the operating margin before I adjusted for R&D was about 25%. That's about 4% higher than the entire semiconductor business. And once couple of ratios. One is you can actually look at the total invested capital and the total invested capital is the red column and you can see how it's soared over the last decade. This is a company that's been investing large amounts to get to the place that it is. In fact, one measure of investment efficiency is to look at how many dollars of revenues you get per dollar of invested capital. And in that measure, you know, N a few weeks ago when it hit the trillion dollar market cap is testimonial. But this is a company whose market cap has gone from basically nothing to over a trillion dollars over the last decade. And as you look at the market cap year by year, there's something I think that we need that stock. If it's that highly valued, probably always overvalued. That's almost never the case. Even the biggest successes have had periods in their life when they were undervalued. In my case, I started in the 1980s. PCs changed the way we work and live. The 1990s, it was the dot-com boom. And much as you look back and say that was a bubble, it changed the way we live. Then you get to this century and smartphones clearly have changed the way we work and live. And in the last decade, social media, for better or worse, has changed the way we live. So the question with AI, is it revolutionary change or is it incremental change? revolutionary changes to. The metaverse. Maybe if you're below a certain age, you know, you're very excited about virtual reality and the metaverse sounds like something you want to be in. For a lot of people, though, it sounds a little geeky, to be quite honest. So I wasn't as excited about the metaverse when Facebook talked about it, because I wasn't sure. It was incremental change. Don't get me wrong. There is a lot of money toPT did. Now, I'll tell you from a personal standpoint, I see AI all around. People talk to me about AI. I think it has the potential to be a revolutionary change. And that means that it's going to affect a lot of companies, a lot of lives, a lot of work. And I'm not quite sure where it will lead us. it back. So I know four decades is not a long time period in stock market history, but if you look at the four decades of revolutionary change, the average return for stocks, the average annual return is about 10.95%. The average annual return in the 50 years leading into it is 9.17%. I'm not going to draw any strong conclusions, but it looks like a net plus, but not a huge net plus. This is not going to make a revolutionary change So if AI succeeds in its promise, the overall market might end up being a little higher, but there will be businesses in demand for hardware and infrastructure that is AI-specific. The NVIDIA story is clearly an AI hardware story, where its market is AI-optimized computer chips, and NVIDIA is expected to grab a large market share of those chips. This is perhaps the most tangible part of the story, the part of the story where it'll be easiest to put numbers on, but hardware and infrastructure for AI. take data and actually convert it into actionable policy strategies. In fact I know big data was supposed to be revolutionary and it never quite made it. Big data twinned with AI might actually pull it off. So my guess is there'll be businesses that actually collect data precisely because AI will use it or process data in a different way so your, because everybody will invest in AI. And if it does reduce costs, they'll compete on price, bringing down margins. So essentially, it'll be like, you know, mutually assured destruction, where the only beneficiaries are the purveyors of AI products, not the'm not that hopeful. I mean, have you seen senators ask questions about AI? I have. And it's clear that they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. I'd be terrified to see the legislation that comes out based on their understanding of AI. And we also know that any regulations or laws that you might write to restrict the dark side of AI will actionable company in terms of AI because it's already in the business. You know, AI chips require special features that NVIDIA has invested in upfront. You remember the investment graph that you saw in R&D and capacity. And the estimates right now is that AI chip business is about 15 to value NVIDIA with what we've learned about the AI story. What does AI add to NVIDIA value? I think the driver for NVIDIA's success has been its capacity to run on high-performance GPU cards and that other companies are still scrambling to catch up. So the fact that NVIDIA is positioned so well to be a high growth company for the next decade. That's kind of tough to do given how much it's grown over the last decade. I think some of that is going to come from being in existing businesses like gaming, which are continuing to grow, albeit at a lower rate. But also the bulk of the growth for NVIDIA is going to come from the AI chip business and the auto chip business. in other businesses, I think you're going to see revenue growth at 15%. The only reason it's that high is there are other new businesses that will keep coming in and adding to the growth. But that growth rate is going to start declining after year five. So based on my revenue story, I'm projecting Nvidia's revenues to increase from about 26 billion to about 266 billion. This isn't a pessimistic in fact a down year, but I think they will make it. In terms of investment efficiency, if you remember, they've been investing a lot. They were getting only about 65 cents for every dollar invested in 2022. I do think that they will be able to get more bang for their buck going forward for two reasons. One is, you know, some of the investment they need for future growth they've already made. The bulk of the investment for the AI growth they might have already made with R&D. drift down as chips become used in everything. I mean, I think that the cycles in the chip business are going to level off as chips become a component in almost everything we use from appliances to automobiles. So with that story in place, let's see how the NVIDIA valuation plays out. So here are my projections for NVIDIA. I know there are lots of numbers on this page. It's easy to get distracted, but focus on the story business. So you add them up. I come up with the value of the operating assets of about $583 billion. Not much debt, no minority interest, no cash of $15 billion. You get a value of equity per share of about $240 per share. And that's what I've typically done other discounted cash flow valuations. I set up a Monte Carlo simulation, but rather than using a single number, I allow my estimates to become distribution. So for revenues, for instance, I brought in uncertainty about the total market for AI, where they're ranging from $225 billion to $425 billion. NVIDIA's market share, where I assume 60% could be higher, could be lower, depending to the industry average of 1.15. But again, there's much uncertainty. It's entirely possible that they could slide back towards the lower sales to capital ratio there in the last decade or the last two years, 0.65, or they could slide up towards the 75th percentile of the industry, which is 1.94. And finally, which actually the stock hit, if you think about it, not that long ago. And at the 90th percentile, I have $326. You're saying, where does $410, which is roughly where the stock was trading at, fall? If you ask me, is it possible that NVIDIA is worth $410, the June 12th price, I would say, yes, it is possible. They're going to be closer to a half a trillion, which would make NVIDIA one of the largest semiconductor chip companies. It would make it by far the largest semiconductor chip company in the world. Or maybe I'm overestimating. Maybe it'll be closer to $100 billion. After all, their revenues right now are only $26 billion. Even $100 billion would be a fourfold increase. My margins in my base case, I use 40%. But as I said, that number could be lower or higher. gross margins. It's not a software company. You can't push the margins up to 60 or 70%. If there's upside, it's got to come from revenues kind of overshooting. And that, I think, is a more plausible story that NVIDIA finds two more new business that we don't even think of how quickly AI came onto the radar. Two other businesses like that, $200, $300 billion markets, NVIDIA could get there. So there is a plausible path, but it's a narrow one. And when a stock does really well, it's tough to let go. You want to hold on to it. So I'd be lying if I said this is going to be an easy decision. But I've also kind of made clear that I'm a value investor. To me, the definition of a value investor is not the Ben Graham definition or even the Warren Buffett definition. It's I believe in buying stocks when the price is less than value. That's why I bought NVIDIA in 2018. And if I'm consistent then and I believe in value and I just told you my value is $240, of my position because I think the stock is overvalued. I held on to the other half, not as a value investment, but more as an option. That this is a stock that could continue to surprise me with its optionality. I know that there are purists who will take issue with me for not selling my entire position, but I'm not a purist. I'm a pragmatist now. And in this case, I am cashing in on a significant profit in my original investment and holding on to the rest. You sell at a high price. You're saying, what causes the price to go up? Your reaction is, I don't care. It could be because of good reasons or bad reasons. Either way, you make money. And to trade, your skill set is you need to be able to gauge mood and momentum because that's what drives prices. And people have become rich trading mood and momentum. And momentum is an incredibly strong force in markets. And right now, the force is with Nvidia, obviously. Look at how much the stock has gone up. do this, all the more power to you. And don't let the value scores take away your happiness. If you in fact traded in Vidya and you made a ton of money, congratulations, well done. Now as a follow through, you know, basically as I said, so to sum up then, if you're a trader, it's all about momentum. And my only pushback is for those people who say, look, you know, momentum can drive up the stock forever. That the stock can keep going up and nothing will stop it, there are lots of losers, lots of false starts, lots of wannabes. And you're going to see a lot of those false starts and wannabes in the AI business as well. I know there are some people who are stepping away from the AI space or refusing to deal with it by saying there's too much uncertainty. We can't make judgments on what AI will do for companies. Okay, that's fine as long as you then stay away from those AI related consequences when they do happen. When. It's not a question of air. And I did think about an experiment asking ChatGPT to write this post for me. I wanted to see how good AI already is.
