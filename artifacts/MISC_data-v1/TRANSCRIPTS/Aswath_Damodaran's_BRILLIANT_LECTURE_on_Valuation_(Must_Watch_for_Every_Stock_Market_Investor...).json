  "text": " So if it's not a science and it's not an art, what the heck is it? I'll give you the word that I use to describe valuation, it's a craft. The analogy I would give that's closest to valuation is cooking. Think of how you master cooking, you could do what my daughter does. She watches cooking shows on TV all day long. She can't cook a leg, would you more naturally think of yourself as a number cruncher or are you more naturally a storyteller? Think about it for just a moment. There's no right answer. Don't look at your neighbor. Don't look at me. Think about yourself. What comes, what do you think, Dad? And I looked and said, Kiran, I like it, but aren't the words supposed to rhyme? Because that's the way I think about poetry, like nursery rhymes. If the last words don't rhyme, it's not poetry to me. He said, Dad, you're not a poet. And I said, you're right, Kiran. Keep writing You hang out with other number crunchers, you talk to other number crunchers, you live with other number crunchers, you forget that always tells me. She said, well, 25 years ago, she was in Lake Tahoe in the middle of a snowstorm driving a Volkswagen Bug. And she had to drive two miles from the grocery store back home. She made it back safe. But valuation were, but there were no stories that connected the numbers together. I had to teach myself how to tell stories. And the first time I did it was like scrambling eggs the very first time. It was a keynote to the CFA, being the only person in the room who doesn't have a CFA, with no desire to ever want a CFA or be near a CFA, is how mechanical so much of it has become. So, I still think the CFA is a great way got through the first steps, two steps, you got a story that you think is not just possible, plausible and probable. You take each part of your story and you convert it into a number in your evaluation. This to me is the craft part. I view it as a challenge. When you give me a story, say where in my evaluation would I reflect that story? By the time I convert my story into numbers clearly people think it's worth a lot. Maybe it's worth less than it was three months ago, but it's still 50, 60, 70 billion. So the first company I'm going to value is Uber in June of 2014. You're saying, why a company, you've got to talk to people. Like whom? Like the customers of the company. Like the employees. Without it, you really don't get a sense of the company. So I'll take you back to June of 2014 in a terrible mood. She says, what do you want? There's no way to talk to your uncle who's not called you in a few weeks. So I said, no. If you're into this Uber, she said, it's a ride-sharing company. I said, what the heck is a ride-sharing company? She said, I don't have the time to talk to you. Why don't you just downloadmakers, that's all they are. They get to keep 20% of the fare. So I could understand why this guy drove for Uber. I could see why Uber did what they did. The one missing piece. Why do people like my son like Uber you want to use. You want to use the ride-sharing app of not the smallest startup, but the company that's around the most because there are more cars around. So Uber has $3 billion. They've got this networking benefit because they got started earlier than I did. And the third potential benefit I could think of is Uber does collect data about you. So if you use Uber picture based on that research, if you can call it research, that I did of asking people questions about the company. So at this stage, I kind of understood what Uber did as a company. I kind of understood the ride-sharing company. Kind of is about all I aspire to do. I don't want to be an expert in ride-sharing. I have operating margin for an automobile company is 4.4%. Low revenue growth, bad margins. Let's nail the coffin shut. Usually, if you're a company with. Very exclusive dreams. If everybody had the same dream, you wouldn't buy the dream. They after the great crisis. You say, how come? If you ask a Ferrari owner, how's the economy doing? You know what their response is? What's an economy that you talk about? To them, bad years, I'm worth only $4 billion. I used. Look at how many people are downloading it. And finally you stop and say, how do you plan to make money? He says, I have to make money? Let me go back to how great the app is and how many people. No, you have to tell me how you eventually expect to make money. Is it on a subscription model? Is it from advertising? So keep it simple. Keep it focused. So I'm going to take a number in my valuation. Now let me show you my Ferrari story. My Ferrari story is that they're going to stay an exclusive club. As opposed to what? As opposed to pulling off a Maserati. Maserati in 2008 looked a lot like Ferrari in 2015. It sold about the question, is it possible that Brazil will win the World Cup? What do you think the answer was in that audience? Of course. I said, is it plausible that they'll win the World Cup? And Brazil's been playing really good. It's plausible. Then I said, it's probable. And they said, you know what? Neymar keeps playing well. So in a sense, possible, they clearly, everybody said it's clearly possible. Then I said, Musk's cousin. So when Tesla bought SolarCity, they knew they were buying a heap of legal trouble. So they decided to insulate themselves. And the way they decided to insulate themselves was by hiring two different investment bankers and paying them a lot of money to buy insulation. So they hired Lazard. So basically, SolarCity hired Laz'd have to live in your Tesla, eat your Tesla, get health care from your Tesla. The only way I can justify it, maybe SpaceX meets Tesla and the next thing you know, Tesla is flying off into space. Now, maybe you're selling to them. It's an impossible valuation. Here's another example of an impossible valuation. valuation. One of my students actually works for the NFL. You know what the NFL is? National Football League, perhaps the best run, most lucrative sporting league in the world. He worked for the NFL and he valued an NFL team and he sent it to me for some feedback. So he projected out revenue growth and cash flows, but I looked to see that they own their own stadium high and you have so little reinvestment? And perhaps you have a really good explanation. I'll give you an example. Somebody was building a toll road company last year. And he had this high revenue growth, almost no reinvestment, and almost no risk. So I said, how come? And he explained to me, and I was okay with it. And here's what he said. This toll road company had spent the previous 15 years building the Bay Area is 300% of what it was in 2008? What does that tell you? There are people taking car service who used to take mass transit. There are people taking car service used to drive their own cars. It's changed the way people transport themselves in of $1,500. But do you want the story to be true, right? I wish I'd made up the story because this is actually a true story. Where did I go with this? Oh, sorry. There you go. The 19-year-old was called Elizabeth Holmes. She dropped out of Stanford and she started Ther test. It's an important test, but take it for what it's worth. You get tested for leukemia. The test comes back and it says, you know what? You might have leukemia or you might not. Work can't tell, but if something bad happens, come back. It's not exactly a feature you look for. I want a this is actually from an equity research report. Any sell-side equity research analysts here? Nobody wants to admit to it. If you are, don't take this personally or take it personally. Frankly, me next week when everybody's going to be around he said okay he said you're not going to write Loompas that do it. Have you seen these dancing little creatures? They to use a high cost of capital. Now, here's where I save myself a lot of time. You know how I estimate the cost of capital? I'd go with the beta, risk-free rate, risk premium, all the stuff they make you do in the CFA for weeks and weeks and weeks, probably partly because I've thrown out a lot of stuff in there. It's a waste of time even doing that for a company like this. I have actually a histogram of saying they don't value companies, they're priceless, but she'd have no idea what I was talking about. So I let it go. I said, yeah. She said, how do you explain the 17 billion? I said, I don't have to. I didn't pay it. I've never felt the urge to explain what other people do. What business and tell me what happens. Five minutes later, I get an email and say, now I see why you did what you did. Nothing happened. Okay, let's let it go then. The Forbes blog loved what I did. They said, Bill is he's actually a partner at benchmark capital which actually was one of the earliest VC investors in uber they invest in uber at a two billion dollar value and rumor was he was the guy was closest to Travis to drop to about 90-10. We don't really make 20%. I said, that's easy to fix. I go to my spreadsheet, change the 80-20 to 90-10, my value goes to 29 billion. Now you're saying this, you're saying that means I can use a DCF to get any number you want. That's not what I read out of this. If I say, this is the end game. It's not going to end well. I'm going to have to reflect that in my valuation. It actually makes valuation a lot more fun to bring in stories because it forces you to think about where your numbers come from. And here's my final anecdote, and I have to be done. So my youngest son, the poet, graduated from high schoolunelleschi's Dome. So after we come out, I said, okay, I have to write a blog post. I said, it's the middle of your vacation. What are you going to write a blog post on? And I wrote a blog post on Brunelleschi's Dome. Those of you who've never been there, Brunelleschi had absolutely no training in architecture, engineering. He was one of those, he actually carved the doors on and he got picked to build the dome.
