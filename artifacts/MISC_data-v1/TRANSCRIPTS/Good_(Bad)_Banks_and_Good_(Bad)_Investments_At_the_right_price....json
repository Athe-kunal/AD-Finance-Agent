  "text": " Hi, welcome back. In my last session I talked about banking as a business, drawing a divergence or a differential between good banks and bad banks. And at least in the simple framework that I created, a bank that has access to sticky deposits, most of which are non-interest bearing, that then takes that capital and invests it in loans and investment securities where it earns an interest rate higher than what it needs to make given price might actually make it a good investment. So I want to focus on valuing and pricing banks in this session. I'm going to start with valuation. I like valuing companies and I like challenges in valuing companies. I like valuing young companies, difficult to value companies and banks are a different breed when it comes to valuation. Let's see why. When you think about valuing reinvestment, but before debt payments. And you discount those cash flows back at a weighted average of what lenders want, which is the cost of debt, and what equity investors want, which is the cost of equity, which in corporate finance is the cost of capital. Cash flows to business, pre-debt cash flows, discounted back at the cost of capital, gives you the value of the business, it has to be equity valuation. So if you're doing an intrinsic valuation, it has to be cash flows to equity discounted at the cost of equity. We'll talk about the challenges you might run into in even doing that, but that's the only pathway. When you're pricing banks, the only multiples you can use, pricing metrics, have to be equity pricing metrics. PE ratios, price to book. I mean, if you see somebody pricing a bank cash flows to equity are cash flows left over after every conceivable need has been met. If you ask me to project out that number, I'm going to project out the net income in future years, and I'm going to project out how much of that net income I need to put into reinvestment, which is net capex and change in working capital with the offset that some of it might come from debt. That gives me my expected free cash flow to equity. Net income. That's easy enough. You can get that. But the rest of the items in that calculation, capex, depreciation, working capital, and of course, we talked about the slipperiness in defining debt, become almost impossible to define. So you say, how do people value banks? Well, the easy answer to that is they gave up on estimating free cash flows to equity because they said, I can't get capex, it in terms of dividends. You discount the dividends and the terminal value of equity obtained from dividends in perpetuity at the cost of equity. You have a dividend discount model value for a company. You can already see why analysts fell back on the dividend discount model. And in fact, banks were the last remnant for the use of the dividend discount model through much of the last, you know, last 30 or 40 years. But in the assumptions and until 2008 I'll make a confession. I made those assumptions. I used the dividend discount model to value everything from Citibank to Goldman Sachs making the argument that banks are run by sensible people in the regulatory framework. I might have been naive and as I said my days of innocence came to an end in 2008 when we woke up to the realization that bothment for a bank. What does that mean? A growing bank will need to reinvest more in regulatory capital than a stable bank. An undercapitalized bank will need to reinvest more than an overcapitalized bank. To estimate free cash flow equity, then I take the net income, I also open the door to being able to adapt or adjust my cost of equity across banks, something which I had very limited room to do with the dividend-discount model. An undercapitalized bank should have a higher cost of equity than an overcapitalized bank. There's a higher failure risk. It opens a model to be more adaptable and flexible. Now, it sounds incredibly abstract, so I'm going to try this out on a bank. a bank that over time ended up with a growth rate and its risk-adjusted assets of about 3%. And I'm going to assume that it can maintain that growth rate. It had seen its return in equity drop to about 8.78%, well below its cost of equity. And at a tier one capital ratio, which is pretty healthy. So the good side of Citi wasn't a risky bank. It was just boring, not that profitable, and slow growth. So in my valuation, here's what into it. I didn't use any risk and return model. I backed into it by looking at how the largest banks were being priced. So you look to the bottom, I take you through the process. Start with the price to book ratio for the 25 largest banks and the return in equity at these banks. Now I'm going to assume that if you're looking at the 25 largest US banks, you're looking at a pretty mature sector and the growth rate of 3.3% and sold for the cost of equity. I'm reverse engineering from the pricing of banks what the cost of equity for a bank is. Came up with 11.67%. Return to my story. Even with my return equity improvement city, I'm leaving them at 9.5% well below their cost of equity. This is not an uplifting story. It's a story about a bank that's slow growth that'll never year one capital translates an investment in regulatory capital. And you can see the investment regulatory capital play out as my reinvestment each year. So what you see as free cash draws equity, 10.7 billion, are roughly speaking the potential dividends I see from Citi over the next five years. What happens after year five? another approach I could use. I could look at how people are pricing other banks and extrapolate from that based on what other people are paying for similar banks to what equity does mean something because it becomes the basis for regulatory capital. A bank cannot survive with a negative book value of equity. In fact, safety capital ratios historically have defined in terms of book value of equity. So for a bank, book value of equity actually has operating consequences. The second is, much as there's talk of mark-to-market, the sector where mark-to-market is its deepest roots is banking. So the value of equity in a bank is to go back to a very simple intrinsic valuation model. I know we're on pricing, but stay in there with me. My simplest equity valuation model is a stable growth dividend discount model. Take expected dividends next year to buy a cost of equity minus growth. It's called the Gordon growth model, oldest discounted cash flow model in use. Let's say I divide both sides of the equation by the book value of equity. more than book value, a high price to book exceeds one, and a company that expects to earn less than its cost of equity should trade at less than book value. So we're going to come back and talk more about this, but you can see what drives price to book ratios. So with that inside, let me take a look at price to book ratios for banks in the U.S. collectively going back over the last 20 years. that you saw before 2008. But guess what? Price-to-book ratios have struggled to get back to those pre-2008 levels. In fact, by May of 2023, the price-to-book ratio for banks was close to one. Banks were being priced on the expectation that they would deliver returns in equity collectively, roughly equal to the cost of equity. I use that line of one as a marginal line, basically arguing that, you know, that is entirely possible that banks, and this is especially as returns on equity have improved, now value investors said this makes no sense. The price-to-book ratio should go up as the return on equity goes up. Now that might be true, and their investment may be a good one, but we need to rule out some fundamental reasons why price-to-book ratios might never go back to what they were pre-2008. The second is maybe banks are less profitable now than they used to be. So I looked at a couple of things. One is I looked at the interest earned on loans and investments versus interest paid on deposits and the spread. The bigger that spread, the more money banks are making. Again, if you take a look at the last decade, there's a 2020 and 2021 drop because, again, the COVID dropped. But you take those two years out, it doesn't look like the spread has changed. more risk than they used to be. We talked about how deposits have become less sticky as investors and customers have more choices. How increased competition for the loan business from non-banking entities is making those businesses less profitable. All in all, you can see a collection of storms gathering and perhaps investors are looking and say, maybe this business is never this crisis has had an impact across the board. Every single number is lower now than it was at the end of 2022, by about 25%, 20%. There's been a big drop in price-to-book ratios across the board at banks. And you can understand why that's happening. There's more fear in the air. Now, perhaps those differences you see in price-to-book across banks can be explained by differences in profitability. had returns on equity between 9.38% and 14.8%. End of 2022, that difference had narrowed between 9.2% and 13.8%. It's a business where there aren't too many outliers. There's a lot of bunching up around the middle, but there are differences in return equity. As I said, the link here is between price-to-book and return equity, and high return equity companies should have high price-to-book ratios, and low return equity companies should have low price- book and return equity. Incidentally, these scatterplots give you a very simple way to find cheap and expensive. May of 2023. The two lines I've drawn reflect the noise in the data. They reflect confidence intervals. The banks that fall above are your overvalued stocks. The banks that fall below are your overpriced stocks and underpriced stocks. It's a good way to think about it. Now, I can, I'd also like that bank to be less risky, have a higher tier one capital ratio. Now, I know this can make you dizzy, but I've created a 3D scatterplot with price to book on way to see it. I thought I'd use what I've learned about price to book and return equity in the context of looking for bargains among the 25 biggest banks. Here's what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a mismatch. I'm looking for a stock that is price cheap. I'm going to start with the price to book. Say I want a low price to book. from a regulatory standpoint. And we do know that one of the concerns in May 2023 is the fact that as interest rates have gone up, there are investment securities on banks' balance sheets that will get written down, and to the extent that they're held to maturity, those losses are not being disclosed. I'd want a low percentage of securities held to maturity. I want them held for sale, which means at least I get an honest picture when I look at the balance sheet. 1.04 or higher into a red number. Danger. The green numbers here indicate cheap relative to the medium. I did the same thing with return equity. Here I took the median return equity 12% for 2022. And then I picked every bank with a return equity greater than 12%. And those are the green numbers. That's good. And every bank with a return equity less than 12% into a red and 12% basically to reflect the fact that that's low profitability. A high tier one capital without the danger of a write-down by having a low percentage of securities held to maturity. On top of that, I'd like to have a high dividend yield. I'd like all greens all the way across, right? Now, the bad news is there are no all greens. The bank that comes closest to being cheap is Citi. It has a price to book of 0.50. by JP Morgan? Because you'd be paying 1.53 times book value. Given a choice between buying Citi at half of book value and getting this boring bad bank, and paying 1.53 times book value and getting a bank that everybody thinks is a star bank. I take the former over the latter as an investor. So when you think about looking at to have an intrinsic value backing it up. But as an investor, there's nothing that prevents you from also looking at pricing. Cities seem to be both undervalued and underpriced. And that makes me more comfortable investing in it. I know for a lot of people, the choice is, do I want to value something or price it? My argument is, why not? No, my response is, why not do both? No. So if you were to think about what makes this session different from the last one,",
