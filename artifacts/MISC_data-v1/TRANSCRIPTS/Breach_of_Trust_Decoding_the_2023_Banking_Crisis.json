{"text": " Hi, it's been a while since my last post. But to be honest, I had nothing critical to say and I've learned that when you have nothing to say, it's better not to say it at all. But the banking crisis has built up over the course of this year and it's created a conundrum because on the one hand, we hear talk of a banking crisis, but on the other hand, the market seems to be pretty unfazed about the whole thing. Well, they take those deposits and loan them out to individuals, to businesses, charge an interest rate that's high enough to cover the default risk. He is high enough to cover the default risk on those loans. And that interest becomes income to the bank. Increasingly, banks also have the option of investing those deposits in marketable securities, in investable risk. On your investment securities, you want to know about what you earn as an interest on those securities, what the average maturity of these securities are, are they short-term or long-term, and to the extent that you're investing in securities where there's default risk, how much default risk there is. And finally, if you look at equity, you want to look at equity as a percentage of your total assets, how much buffer have you built in. And as we will see in the next were taken off the table. So the great Glass-Steagall kind of restricted banks to banking. Those Glass-Steagall rules over time have been loosened. But in the 1980s, the Basel Accords, where G10 countries got together, globalized and formalized the regulation of banks by creating this notion of risk-weighted or risk-adjusted assets, where essentially basically a bailout program for the biggest banks which had faced significant losses on their mortgage-backed securities. So the TARP, as it was called, invested about $426 billion in bank stocks and reported. On the loan front, good banks have a diverse mix of borrowers. They're not lending to the same type of borrowers. Get an interest rate in the borrowers that is reflective of their default risk. Notice I didn't say they lend to safe borrowers. You could be a good bank that lends to risky borrowers as long as you charge them a high enough interest rate. And they build in enough of investors, analysts, even regulators in the good times. It almost always takes a macro crisis of some sort for people to notice that banks are in trouble, that you've got bad banks. One, of course, is recession. Through the history of banking, when recessions come around, they test banks. invested in T-bonds, 10-year T-bonds in 2021 and early 2022, those bonds would be worth about 20% less than they were at the start of the year. That's an uncommonly large hit you're going to take. So when you think about interest rates and how they play out at a bank, let's start with the bad stuff. Your loans collectively are going to be became the problem that it was, we have to go back in time. This is a bank that's been around a long time that decided it was going to go after niche market, which is Silicon Valley in all of its different forms. VCs, founders, employees at startups, and essentially make its business model built around Silicon Valley. The good news was not growing. So all this money come in. There's not much opportunity for you to put into venture debt. So where does it go? Silicon Valley Bank invested it in long-term bonds, T-bonds and safe mortgage-backed securities. Now, that choice of investing in investment securities was probably out of their hands. What else could they do? But they made the choice to invest in longer move money quickly. The bank melted down. So its very success created the seeds for the failure that came about at Silicon Valley Bank. Now you're saying, what about Signature and First Republic? What sure there's a huge, huge amount of research done in this. But as I look at it as a novice, when I look at what drives deposit stickiness, there are four characteristics that I can see that will make some bank deposits more sticky than others, that index is down 26%. Look at regional banks, it's down about 35%. I mean, how would I read this graph? Basically, the lowest growth banks. This graph is pretty striking. It's the highest growth banks that have seen big drops in value. In fact, you take the top five deciles, they've lost about be mark to market because that comes with its own set of dangers. But I do think the rules on what gets mark to market will get tighter. And finally, I think that there are going to be regulatory changes coming.
