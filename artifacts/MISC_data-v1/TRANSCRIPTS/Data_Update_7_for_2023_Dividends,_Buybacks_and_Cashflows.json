  "text": " Hi, welcome back to this, my seventh and last data update for 2023. And since it's already March, it's only nine months until the next year's updates anyway. And in this one, I'd like to focus on dividends and buybacks. In other words, cash returned by companies to their shareholders. I'm always mystified by why people think of dividends as some kind of loser game, in Ohio where you had a chemical spill and people were having health problems. A terrible accident. A company called Norfolk Southern. And people argued that the accident happened because Norfolk Southern had done buybacks two, three years ago. And that was the cause for the accident. We'll come back and address that. But that was the first the tax code was an additional tax on buybacks, a 2% tax on buybacks. When companies buy 100 million of their own stock back, they'll have to pay 2 million in taxes. Now, one reason, of course, is to collect revenues, and I have no problem with that. But there's also a subtle message or not so subtle message that was in the legislation, which is buybacks are bad. We want to discour companies across the board in 2022. And in data update five, I talked about how difficult it is for companies to make that hurdle rate, even in good years, years when the hurdle rate was much lower. And among that 70% that are having trouble, maybe for 30 or 40%, they're just in bad businesses, just give the cash back to the owners. Now, whether you do it in the form of dividends and buybacks will depend on what your shareholders prefer to get. And we'll come back and address what that might be for any given company. But that's a dividend decision. There are some companies where dividends actually start the process. These are companies which have paid dividends for a long time and don't want to stop or they don't even want to reduce dividends or they're in a peer group where everybody else plays dividends. See the same forces inertia and metooism kick in and in those companies the dividend gets set first and it then flows into what kind of investments paying on and I think you can in fact I'm going to use a free cash flow measure called free cash flow equity but I think a more sensible way to think about is potential dividend what you can afford to pay out in dividends and here's how it works out you start with net income why because you're an equity investor you start with a measure of equity earnings you add back non cash charges depreciation amortization other non cash charges why because there are left in the till for an owner of a business after he or she has met every conceivable need. You can take it out without hurting the business. It is potential dividend. Now, if you look at that calculation, you can already see that that free cash flow equity, that you arrive at as a bottom line, could end up as a negative number. How? You could be a money losing company, in which case you start with a net loss rather than net income. And if you're a money losing company with a lot of reinvestment, or even a money making company with a lot for future growth. No wonder young companies burn through cash. They're called cash burning machines. As you become a growth company and your business model takes form, your losses can start to become profits. But remember, you're still a high growth company. You might need to reinvest a lot. So you might still have negative free cash trust equity. Eventually, though, as growth starts to level off, here's show up. And then you go into decline, your cash return goes into hyperspeed. And here's why. In decline, you're making your company smaller. You're, in a sense, liquidating your company. You might pay out well above your free cash flow to equity as dividends or in buybacks because you're making your company smaller. So you tell me what your free cash flows to equity look like. I can start guessing where you you pay more in dividends. Same kind of statistics with buybacks. About 14.2% of companies buy back stock. About 41% of the oldest companies buy back stock. The youngest companies only 14.2%. If you look at the total cash return, about one quarter of the youngest companies return by stating what I believe are facts, things you can back up with the numbers. And there are three basic facts I want to put on the table. Here's the first one. In the US, it's undeniable that there's been a shift away from dividends to buybacks. It's dramatic, it's drastic. So it benefits might have been an original rationale, but they no longer are. So let's look at those facts. Let's start with the first one. In this graph, I've started in 1988. And to give you some perspective, I first started in corporate finance in the early 80s. And in 1982, 83, 84, about 10% of all cash returned by companies came in the form of buybacks. No, in fact, companies at least pre-1980 graph because 2022 is not quite done in terms of getting the data on buybacks. More than a trillion dollars was returned by U.S. companies in the form of buybacks. About two out of. They're about 9, 10, 11%. But there might be a good reason why buybacks haven't picked up there yet, and maybe they will in the future. So clearly, buybacks are here to stay. They're growing graph out the percentage of U.S. companies each year that do nothing to dividends. That's a blue column. Notice that in every single year from 1988 through 2021, companies that do nothing to dividends leave them unchanged, outnumber companies that change dividends. And when companies do change dividends, dividend increases outnumber dividend decreases flexible they allow you to adjust much more quickly to circumstances around you remember the graph i showed you about buybacks in 2009 that's the right thing to happen you want cash return to drop off during a crisis and it didn't 2009 first quarter 2020 companies are worried dividends stayed pretty stagnant there were a which meant that you paid ordinary income taxes and buybacks were taxed as capital gains if you had for more than a year. Take a look at the difference between the dividend tax rate and the capital gains tax rate. In fact, the puzzle is not that companies started doing buybacks in the 80s.. converged with that tax code change of that year at 15%. They were both taxed at 15%. And since then, they've locked in at the same rate. It's now 23.8%. If you include the fact that you have to pay Medicare taxes per share, that this is good for your stock price. Is that true? And then buyback critics push back in the opposite direction. They say buybacks are bad for value. They're both wrong. Buybacks cannot increase value or decrease the value of a business. They can redistribute value. It's mysterious, but I'll come back and address that. The second is that the surge in buybacks, especially in the U.S., and this is directed to U.S. companies, has Who are those other stakeholders? That the 10 billion you did in a buyback could have been used to pay your employees more or to give your customers a better product or a better service or lower prices. And as a consequence, the argument is it's unfair that companies are able to buy back shares where other stakeholders are suffering. Let's look at why each see an increase in value. It's really a tax subsidy that you're getting from the government. You get an increase in value, but it's not because of the buyback. It's because you borrowed money to get closer to the right mix. If you're a company that's already at the right debt ratio or over levered and you go out and borrow money to do a buyback, you'll hurt yourself. And again, it's not the buyback that se that is affecting value, it's how it's funded or what effect it has on investments. So here's the bottom line. Dividends and buybacks cannot really affect value unless you bring in either debt or investment effects. But there's a difference between dividends and buybacks on whether they can redistributes value, doesn't increase value or reduce value, redistributes value from the shareholders who remain to the shareholders who sold their shares back. If you buy back shares at a price lower than your value, then the reverse happens. The shareholders who sell their shares back are having redistributed from me to those people who sell back. But you don't have to ban buybacks to prevent this from happening. If you really think the company owns shares and is buying back shares at too high a price, you know what you should do? Just sell your shares back. You don't have to bitch and moan about too high a price. companies that bought back stock versus companies that did not buy back stock. And I looked at two measures of how much debt they had. One is the total debt to capital ratio in market terms. And the second is the total debt is a multiple of EBITDA. And remember, the higher this number, the more debt you have. So here's what I saw. If you look at all buyback companies, their debt ratio is about 33 to 34 percent. But if you this graph because this argument that buybacks are funded with debt has been primarily focused on U.S. companies. Let's talk about this. Now, last year when the bill that increased the buyback tax was being debated, I made the mistake of actually listening to the Senate debate on this issue. Would you have wanted Bed Bath & Beyond to keep building new stores for the last decade? I didn't. This is a company that mastered the art of destroying value, right? How is that going to be good for the economy? Or in a different example, and this might sound cruel, but I'm going to say it anyway, wouldn't we all have been better off if GE had just liquidated itself as a company in 2010 and returned the cash to the shareholders? I not whether you want investment in the economy, but who should be doing the investment. Do you want to be old-time companies whose best days are behind them, who are in bad businesses? Or do you want younger, more dynamic companies that need the capital, are disruptors perhaps, that can change the economy? That should really be the core argument, not is this company investing or another test and I'm unable to do the data test on this because I don't have the data on a segment of what I need. I'll wager that if you looked at employee wages and benefits that companies that do the most buybacks pay the highest wages and treat their employees better than the companies that don't do the buybacks. The reason is simple. illiterates and what was the other word, you know, demagogues. But I do think there's an ideological component to buybacks, which is that, you know, buybacks are viewed as going to wealthy people and there is at least this sub-message that wealthy people already have enough money, so we should make it more difficult for them to get more money. But if you're taxing buybacks, do it at least because you want the money. You know. A law designed to keep compensation in check gave rise to a phenomenon that caused management compensation to explode out of the box. Stock-based compensation. You've got to be careful when you write laws to fix a problem that you don't create further problems. My concern is that in the zeal to tax buybacks because you view it as a bad thing,",
