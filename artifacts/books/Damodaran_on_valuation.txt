The first concerns the length of the estimation period. The trade-off is simple: A longer estimation period provides more data, but the firm itself might have changed in its risk characteristics over the time period. The second estimation issue relates to the return interval. Returns on stocks are available on an annual, monthly, weekly, daily, and even on an intraday basis. Using daily or intraday returns will increase the number of observations in the regression, but it exposes the estimation process to a significant bias in beta estimates related to nontrading. 26 For instance, the betas estimated for small firms, which are more likely to suffer from nontrading, are biased downward when daily returns are used. Using weekly or monthly returns can reduce the nontrading bias significantly. 27 The third estimation issue relates to the choice of a market index to be used in the regression. In most cases, analysts are faced with a mind-boggling array of choices among indices when it comes to estimating betas; there are more than 20 broad equity indices ranging from the Dow 30 (Dow Jones Industrial Average) to the Wilshire 5000 in the United States alone. One common practice is to use the index that is most appropriate for the investor who is looking at the stock. Thus, if the analysis is being done for a U.S. investor, the S&P 500 index is used. This is generally not appropriate. By this rationale, an investor who owns only two stocks should use an index composed of only those stocks to estimate betas. The right index to use in analysis should be determined by the holdings of the marginal investor in the company being analyzed. If the marginal investors in a company hold only domestic stocks, we can use the regressions against the local indices.

A number of firms, with Wal-Mart and Dell being the most prominent examples, have used this strategy to grow. While this may seem like a cost-efficient strategy, there are potential downsides. The first is that supplier credit is generally not really free. To the extent that delaying paying supplier bills may lead to the loss of cash discounts and other price breaks, firms are paying for the privilege. Thus, a firm that decides to adopt this strategy will have to compare the costs of this capital to more traditional forms of borrowing. The second is that a negative noncash working capital has generally been viewed by both accountants and ratings agencies as a source of default risk.

When trading any asset, they are three other ingredients that go into the trading costs. The first is the spread between the price at which you can buy an asset (the dealer\u2019s ask price) and the price at which you can sell the same asset at the same point in time (the dealer\u2019s bid price).

The third cost, which was first proposed by Jack Treynor in his article 1 on transactions costs, is the opportunity cost associated with waiting to trade.

To illustrate how the model works, consider a firm with an expected cash flow next period of $1.00. Assume that rate, based on fundamental risk but before adjusting for liquidity risk, is 9 percent and that the expected growth in the cash flows in perpetuity is 4 percent. This firm would have an intrinsic value of $20. 75 In the QMDM, the analyst would adjust the discount rate for illiquidity (assume that he would add 3 percent to the discount rate to arrive at a required return of 12 percent), specify a holding period (say five years) and the percent of the available cash flows that will be paid out (say 60 percent).

In other words, you can have a completely liquid investment with absolutely no control over how a firm is run, as is often the case with stock in a large publicly traded company.
