The value of a brand name or patent should be the present value of the cash flows from that asset, discounted at an appropriate risk- adjusted rate. The problem that we face is that the accounting standards for firms with intangible assets are not entirely consistent with the standards for firms with physical assets. An automobile company that invests in a new plant or factory is allowed to treat that expenditure as a capital expenditure, record the item as an asset, and depreciate it over its life. A technology firm that invests in research and development, with the hope of generating new patents, is required to expense the entire expenditure and record no assets, and it cannot amortize or depreciate the item. The same can be said of a consumer products company that spends millions on advertising with the intent of building a brand name. The consequences of estimating the basic inputs for valuation are profound. For existing assets, the accounting treatment of intangible assets makes both current earnings and book value unreliable. The former is net of R&D, and the latter does not include investments in the firm\u2019s biggest assets. Because reinvestment and accounting return numbers are flawed for the same reasons, assessing expected growth becomes more difficult. Because lenders tend to be wary about lending to firms with intangible assets, they tend to be funded predominantly with equity, and the risk of equity can change quickly over a firm\u2019s life cycle. Finally, estimating when a firm with intangible assets gets to steady state can be complex. On the one hand, easy entry into and exit from the business and rapid changes in technology can cause growth rates to drop quickly at some firms. On the other hand, the long life of some competitive advantages like brand name and the ease with which firms can scale up (they do not need heavy infrastructure or physical investments) can allow other firms to maintain high growth, with excess returns, for decades.

Because the return is guaranteed, an investment must meet two conditions to be risk-free. The first is that the entity making the guarantee can have no default risk; this is why we use government securities to derive risk-free rates, a necessary though not always sufficient condition. As you will see in Chapter 6, many governments have default risk and the bonds they issue are therefore not risk free. The second condition is that there can be no reinvestment risk and that the time horizon matters. A six-month Treasury bill is not risk-free if you are looking at a five-year time horizon, because you are exposed to reinvestment risk. In fact, even a five-year Treasury bond may not be riskless, because the coupons received every six months have to be reinvested. Clearly, getting a risk-free rate is not as simple as it looks at the outset. The equity risk premium is the premium that investors demand for investing in risky assets (or equities) as a class, relative to the risk-free rate. It is a function not only of how much risk investors perceive in equities as a class, but also the risk aversion that they bring to the market. It also follows that the equity risk premium can change over time, as market risk and risk aversion both change. The conventional practice for estimating equity risk premiums is to use the historical risk premium\u2014the premium investors have earned over long periods (say, 75 years) investing in equities instead of risk- free (or close to risk-free) investments. Chapter 7, \u201cRisky Ventures: Assessing the Price of Risk,\u201d questions the efficacy of this approach and offers alternatives. To estimate the beta in the CAPM and betas in multifactor models, we draw on statistical techniques and historical data. The standard approach for estimating the CAPM beta is to run a regression of returns on a stock against returns on a broad equity market index. The slope captures how much the stock moves for any given market move.

A firm in stable growth is different from that same firm in high growth on a number of dimensions. In general, you would expect stable-growth firms to be less risky and use more debt.

The primary tool for estimating intrinsic value is the discounted cash flow model. We started by looking at the contrast between valuing the equity in a business and valuing the entire business, and then we moved on to the four inputs we need for the model. The cash flows to equity investors can be defined strictly as dividends, more expansively as dividends augmented with stock buybacks, and most generally as free cash flows to equity (potential dividends). The cash flow to the firm is the cumulative cash flow to both equity investors and lenders and thus is a predebt cash flow. The discount rates we apply have to be consistent with the cash flow definition, with the cost of equity used to discount cash flows to equity and the cost of capital to discount cash flows to the firm. When estimating growth, we noted the limitations of historical growth numbers and outside estimates and the importance of linking growth to fundamentals. Finally, we applied closure to the models by assuming that cash flows will settle into stable growth sometime in the future, but we imposed constraints on what this growth rate can be and the characteristics of stable-growth companies.", "page_num": 117, "coordinates": [[76.567628556182, 230.37909459989135], [76.567628556182, 509.3456003475182], [535.4108797079426, 509.3456003475182], [535.4108797079426, 230.37909459989135]]}, {"text": "We closed the chapter by looking at three variations on the discounted cash flow model.

Although this might not be necessary when comparing identical investments (Mickey Mantle rookie cards), it is necessary when comparing assets that vary in size or units.

It is far easier to sell a relative valuation than a discounted cash flow valuation. After all, discounted cash flow valuations can be difficult to explain to clients, especially when working under a time constraint. Many sales pitches are made over the phone or online to investors who have only a few minutes to spare. Relative valuations, on the other hand, fit neatly into short sales pitches. It is far easier to spin a relative valuation than it is to spin a discounted cash flow valuation. It is easy to defend: Analysts are often called on to defend their valuation assumptions in front of superiors, colleagues, and clients. Discounted cash flow valuations, with their long lists of explicit assumptions, are much more difficult to defend than relative valuations, where the pricing used for a multiple often comes from what the market", "page_num": 157, "coordinates": [[105.48945061085604, 385.19114206333114], [105.48945061085604, 705.3260931243746], [527.9544905160449, 705.3260931243746], [527.9544905160449, 385.19114206333114]]}, {"text": "is paying for similar firms.

In a sense, we are challenging investors who have a problem with a relative valuation to take it up with the market if they have a problem with the value. Market imperatives: Relative valuation is much more likely to reflect the current mood of the market, because it attempts to measure relative and not intrinsic value. Thus, in a market where all technology stocks see their prices bid up, relative valuation is likely to yield higher values for these stocks than discounted cash flow valuations. In fact, by definition, relative valuations generally yield values that are closer to market prices than discounted cash flow valuations, across all stocks. This is particularly important for investors whose job it is to make judgments on relative value and who are themselves judged on a relative basis.

Although you might have reasonable and unbiased estimates of both these numbers (the expected number of barrels produced and the expected oil price), what you are missing in your expected cash flows is the interplay between these numbers. Oil companies can observe the price of oil and adjust production accordingly; they produce more oil when oil prices are high and less when oil prices are low.

The first is that the decision tree approach is built on probabilities and allows for multiple outcomes at each branch. On the other hand, the real options approach is more constrained in its treatment of uncertainty. In its binomial version, there can be only two outcomes at each stage, and the probabilities are not specified. The second reason is that the discount rates used to estimate present values in decision trees, at least in conventional usage, tend to be risk-adjusted. They are not conditioned on which branch of the decision tree you are looking at. When computing the value of a diabetes drug in a decision tree in Chapter 3, we used a 10% cost of capital as the discount rate for all cash flows from the drug in both good and bad outcomes. In the real options approach, the discount rate varies, depending on the branch of the tree being analyzed. In other words, the cost of capital for an oil company if oil prices increase might very well be different from the cost of capital when oil prices decrease.

To illustrate this point, assume that you are trying to estimate the expected return over a five-year period, and that you want a risk-free rate.

The solution is to strip the coupons from the bond and make it a zero-coupon bond. Thus, the risk-free rates for each period will be measured by using the rate on a zero-coupon default-free bond maturing in that period. In the U.S., where zero coupon treasuries have been traded for several years now, this is a trivial task. Even if zero coupon bonds are not traded, we can estimate zero coupon rates for each period by using the rates on coupon-bearing bonds.

With Latin American companies, for instance, the currency of choice is the U.S. dollar, and the discount rates are estimated in U.S. dollars. With cash flows, analysts either stick with local currency cash flows or convert those cash flows at the current exchange rate into a mature market currency. Again, with Latin American companies, the cash flows in the local currency are converted into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. If the value of the company is computed using these cash flows and discount rates, the resulting value will be fatally flawed, because the expected inflation built into the cash flows will be different from the expected inflation built into discount rates. Consider, for instance, a Mexican company where the cash flows are estimated in pesos and the discount rate is estimated in U.S. dollars. Because, in early 2017, the expected inflation rate in pesos is about 4% and the inflation rate built into the U.S. dollar discount rate is only 2%, we will overvalue the company.

As we will see later in this chapter, it is widely believed that most conventional utility models do not do a good job of explaining observed equity risk premiums. Economic risk: The risk in equities as a class comes from more general concerns about the health and predictability of the overall economy. Put in more intuitive terms, the equity risk premium should be lower in an economy with predictable inflation, interest rates, and economic growth than in one where these variables are volatile. A related strand of research examines the relationship between equity risk premium and inflation, with mixed results. Studies that look at the relationship between the level of inflation and equity risk premiums find little or no correlation. In contrast, Brandt and Wang (2003) argue that news about inflation dominates news about real economic growth and consumption in determining risk aversion and risk premiums.1 They present evidence that equity risk premiums tend to increase if inflation is higher than anticipated and decrease when it is lower than expected. Reconciling the findings, it seems reasonable to conclude that it is not so much the level of inflation that determines equity risk premiums but uncertainty about that level. Information: When you invest in equities, the risk in the underlying economy is manifested in volatility in the earnings and cash flows reported by individual firms in that economy. Information about these changes is transmitted to markets in multiple ways. It is clear that significant changes have occurred in both the quantity and quality of information available to investors over the last two decades. During the market boom of the late 1990s, some people argued that the lower equity risk premiums we observed in that period reflected the fact that investors had access to more information about their investments, leading to higher confidence and lower risk premiums in 2000. After the accounting scandals that followed the market collapse, others attributed the increase in the equity risk premium to deteriorating quality of information as well as information overload. In effect, they argued that easy access to large amounts of information of varying reliability was making investors less certain about the future.

After all, markets vary widely in terms of transparency and information disclosure requirements. Markets like Russia, where firms provide little (and often flawed) information about operations and corporate governance, should have higher risk premiums than markets like the United States, where information on firms is not only more reliable but also much more easily accessible to investors. Liquidity: In addition to the risk from the underlying real economy and imprecise information from firms, equity investors also have to consider the additional risk created by illiquidity. If investors have to accept large discounts on estimated value or pay high transaction costs to liquidate equity positions, they will pay less for equities today (and thus demand a large risk premium). The notion that the market for publicly traded stocks is wide and deep has led to the argument that the net effect of illiquidity on aggregate equity risk premiums should be small. However, there are two reasons to be skeptical about this argument. The first is that not all stocks are widely traded, and illiquidity can vary widely across stocks; the cost of trading a widely held, large market cap stock is very small, but the cost of trading an over-the-counter stock is much higher. The second reason is that the cost of illiquidity in the aggregate can vary over time, and even small variations can have significant effects on equity risk premiums. In particular, the cost of illiquidity seems to increase when economies slow down and during periods of crisis, thus exaggerating the effects of both phenomena on the equity risk premium. Catastrophic risk: When investing in equities, the potential for catastrophic risk always exists. These are events that occur infrequently but can cause dramatic drops in wealth. Examples in equity markets include the Great Depression from 1929 to 1930 in the U.S. and the collapse of Japanese equities in the late 1980s. In cases like these, many investors exposed to the market declines saw the values of their investments drop so much that it was unlikely that they would be made whole again in their lifetimes.2 Although the possibility of catastrophic events might be low, they cannot be ruled out, and the equity risk premium has to reflect that risk.", "page_num": 279, "coordinates": [[105.43816606299288, 73.6673861154452], [105.43816606299288, 642.0042770347402], [528.0541808672535, 642.0042770347402], [528.0541808672535, 73.6673861154452]]}, {"text": "Default Spreads Equity risk premiums measure what investors demand for investing in equities.

Consequently, your valuation will be on more solid ground if you forecast what the operating numbers, including growth, return on capital, and cost of capital, will look like across a cycle and use those numbers in valuing the company. Thus, in Chapter 13, when we value Toyota, a cyclical, auto company, we will normalize current earnings and use a smoothed-out growth rate of 1.5% in perpetuity to value Toyota as a mature company. In doing so, we recognize that earnings growth will be much higher in boom years and much lower in recession years, but lacking the capacity to forecast booms and busts, we believe that valuing with the smoothed-out growth rate will deliver a more robust estimate of value. Do not bring views on economy into valuation: We all have views on the economy, and it is natural to try to bring those views into valuation, especially with companies that we believe are sensitive to the economy. The danger of doing so, though, is that it makes every valuation that you do a joint function of both what you think about the company and your economic views, making it difficult for others to use your valuation in making investment judgments. So, what should you do? Value the company with consensus views on the economy, even if you disagree with them. After you have valued the company, create a separate analysis based on your views on the economy and what sectors or groups of stocks will be helped or hurt the most, if those views become reality. The latter can be used by investors, if they trust your judgments on the economy, to decide which sectors they should invest in and the former can be used to pick individual companies with each sector.

Building on that theme, one of the most dangerous mistakes that you can make in valuation is to mix up currencies, with cash flows estimated in one currency and discount rates measures in another. When Latin American and Turkish analysts, lacking faith in their own high-inflation currencies, decide to dollarize their valuations, they have to be wary because discount rates are easily dollarized, but cash flows, if not dealt with right, might stay in the local currency (often because growth rates are estimated from historical data in local currency terms). That mismatch will lead to overvaluing companies. With stable currency market analysts, the mismatch results from a more subtle problem and occurs when the economy that they are in is going through an inflation transition, from low to higher inflation or vice versa. Again, the problem occurs because many of the numbers underlying cash flows, such as growth rates and returns on capital, come from a low- inflation past and discount rates reflect a high inflation present. They will end up undervaluing companies, as many U.S. analysts did in the 1970s when inflation rates in the U.S. jumped. Internal Inconsistencies: Expected inflation shows up in almost every input into a valuation, and changing just one, without changing the others, to reflect different inflation expectations can lead to inconsistencies. Thus, higher inflation will translate into higher discount rates and higher growth rates but its effects are not limited to these numbers.

That is the basis for the argument that it is only non- diversifiable risk that you incorporate into the discount rates, not total risk. Bringing that perspective into looking at exchange rates is helpful, because it focuses attention on who the marginal investors in the company are and how they perceive exchange rate risk. To the extent that the marginal investors are globally diversified institutions (BlackRock or Fidelity, for instance), we would argue that exchange rate risk can cause earnings to be volatile and stock prices to move, but it does not translate into higher discount rates.

Some of the youngest do not even have a product to sell, just an idea for a product and a market that it might serve. Small or no revenues, operating losses: The limited history that is available for young companies is rendered even less useful by the fact that they contain little operating detail. Revenues are small or nonexistent for idea companies, and the expenses often are associated with getting the business established, rather than generating revenues. In combination, they result in significant operating losses. Dependent on private equity: With a few exceptions, young businesses are dependent on equity from private sources, rather than public markets. At the earlier stages, the equity is provided almost entirely by the founder (and friends and family). As the promise of future success increases, and with it the need for more capital, venture capitalists become a source of equity capital, in return for a share of ownership in the firm. Many don\u2019t survive: Most young companies don\u2019t survive the test of commercial success. Several studies back up this statement, although they vary in the failure rates they find. A study of 5,196 start-ups in Australia found that the annual failure rate was in excess of 9% and that 64% of the businesses failed in a ten-year period.2 Knaup and Piazza (2005, 2008) used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) to compute survival statistics across firms.3 This census contains information on more than 8.9 million U.S. businesses in both the public and private sector. Using a seven-year database from 1998 to 2005, the authors concluded that only 44% of all businesses that were founded in 1998 survived at least four years and that only 31% made it through all seven years.

Multiple claims on equity: The repeated forays made by young companies to raise equity do expose equity investors, who invested earlier in the process, to the possibility that their value can be reduced by deals offered to subsequent equity investors.

This can take the form of first claims on cash flows from operations and in liquidation. Investors also might have control or veto rights, allowing them to have a say in the firm\u2019s actions.

All valuation multiples have to be scaled to some common measure. Conventional scaling measures include earnings, book value, and revenues. With young companies, each of these measures can pose problems.

Because the firm has been in operation only a short while, the book value is likely to be a very small number and won\u2019t reflect the true capital invested in the company. Even revenues can be problematic, because they can be nonexistent for idea companies and miniscule for companies that have just transitioned into commercial production. What are your comparable companies? When relative valuation is used to value a publicly traded company, the comparable firms are usually publicly traded counterparts in the same sector. With young companies, the comparison would logically be to other young companies in the same business, but these companies are usually not publicly traded and have no market prices (or multiples that can be computed). We could look at the multiples at which publicly traded firms in the same sector trade at, but these firms are likely to have very different risk, cash flow, and growth characteristics than the young firm being valued. What is the best proxy for risk? Many of the proxies used for risk, in relative valuation, are market-based. Thus, beta or standard deviation of equity returns are often used as measures of equity risk, but these measures cannot be computed for young companies that are privately held. In some cases, the standard deviation in accounting numbers (earnings and revenues) is used as a measure of risk, but this, too, cannot be computed for a firm that has been in existence for a short time. How do you control for survival? In the context of discounted cash flow valuation, we looked at the problems created by the high failure rate of young companies.

Consequently, many valuations of young companies focus on the top line (revenues) and the bottom line (earnings, usually equity earnings). Little or no attention is paid to either the intermediate items (that separate earnings from revenues) or the reinvestment requirements (that separate earnings from cash flows). Focus on the short term, rather than the long term: The uncertainty we feel about the estimates we make for young companies become greater as we go further out in time. Many analysts use this as a rationale for cutting short the estimation period, using only three to five years of forecasts in the valuation. \u201cForecasting beyond that point in time is too difficult\u201d is the justification they offer for this short time horizon. Mixing relative with intrinsic valuation: To deal with the inability to estimate cash flows beyond short time periods, analysts who value young companies use relative valuation as a crutch. Thus, the value at the end of the forecast period (three to five years) is often estimated by applying an exit multiple to the expected revenues or earnings in that year. The value of that multiple is itself estimated by looking at what publicly traded companies in the business trade at right now. Discount rate as the vehicle for all uncertainty: The risks associated with investing in a young company include not only the traditional factors\u2014earnings volatility and sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions, for example\u2014but also the likelihood that the firm will not survive to make a run at commercial success. When valuing private businesses, analysts often hike up discount rates to reflect all their concerns about the firm, including the likelihood that the firm will not make it. Share count adjustments for dilution: Young growth firms are often dependent on new equity issuances in future years to cover cash flow needs arising both from operating shortfalls and reinvestment needs. That resulting dilution in future years has to be factored into the value of existing equity shares, because existing equity investors will own smaller and smaller proportions of the business in future years. Many analysts, faced with this reality, try to adjust for future dilution by estimating future equity issues and adjusting the share count today for those issues. That creates a circularity problem because you need to estimate share prices in future years to estimate future share issuances and you need future share issuances to estimate current share price. Ad hoc and arbitrary adjustments for differences in equity claims: As we noted in the preceding section, equity claims in young businesses can have different rights when it comes to cash flow and control.

Venture capital valuations try to avoid the serious challenges of estimating operating details for the long term by cutting off the estimates prematurely (with a short forecast period) and using a multiple that is usually based on what comparable companies are trading at currently. However, the multiple of earnings or revenues that a business will trade at three years from now will be a function of the cash flows after that point. Not estimating those cash flows or dealing with the uncertainty in the cash flows does not mean that the uncertainty has gone away. A degree of sloppiness is associated with the use of a target rate to discount the firm\u2019s future value. This target rate is the rate demanded by venture capitalists, who are equity investors in the firm. It incorporates the likelihood that the business will fail. Using this number as the discount rate on the future value of the business creates two problems. The first is that the future value discounted has to be an equity value. Of course, this is the case when we use expected equity earnings and a PE ratio, but it is not so if we use revenues and enterprise value multiples. In the latter case, we should consider the cost of capital as the discount rate and not the rate demanded by just equity investors. The second problem is that building in a probability that the business will not survive into the discount rate also implies that this rate will not change over time, as a firm moves through the life cycle. The distinction between pre- and post-money values in the VC approach is largely in the eyes of the beholder, partly because the approach does not explicitly make assumptions about how the VC capital is used and its link to the estimated future earnings.

In effect, the price includes other services and side factors that might be specific to the transaction. Thus, a doctor selling a medical practice might get a higher price because he agrees to stay on for a period of time after the transaction to ease the transition. Timing differences: Private business transactions are infrequent and reflect the fact that the same private business will not be bought and sold dozens of time during a particular period. Unlike public firms, where the current price can be used to compute the multiples for all firms at the same point in time, private transactions are often staggered across time. A database of private transactions can therefore include transactions spread from June 2008 and December 2008, a period when the public markets lost almost 45% of their value. Scaling variable: To compare firms of different scale, we generally divide the market price by a standardizing variable. With publicly traded firms, this can take the form of revenues (price/sales, EV/sales), earnings (PE, EV/EBITDA), or book value. While we could technically do the same with private transactions, there are two potential roadblocks. The first is that some young firms have little to show in terms of current revenues and earnings, and what they do show might not be a good indication of their ultimate potential. The second is that there are broad differences in accounting standards across private businesses, and these differences can result in bottom lines that are not quite equivalent. The third is that in countries where private business owners are focused on minimizing taxes paid, it should come as no surprise that the numbers in the reporting statements (for taxes) bear little resemblance to the real earnings of a company. Nonstandardized equity: As we noted in the preceding section, equity claims in young, private businesses can vary widely in terms of cash flow and control claims. The transaction price for equity in a private business reflects the claims that are embedded in the equity in that business. It might not easily generalize to equity in another firm with different characteristics. Non-U.S. firms: Most of the transaction databases that are available and accessible today are databases of transactions of private businesses in the U.S. As we are called on increasingly to value young businesses in other markets, some of which are riskier, emerging markets, it is not clear how or even whether this data can be used in that context.", "page_num": 381, "coordinates": [[95.3281206547448, 370.1626924579443], [95.3281206547448, 714.1626726206136], [531.5653388483975, 714.1626726206136], [531.5653388483975, 370.1626924579443]]}, {"text": "Usefulness and Best Practices So, when is it appropriate to use private transaction data to value a young, private business?

For instance, multiples of revenues (which are more difficult to fudge or manipulate) should be preferred to multiples of earnings. We could even scale value to units specific to the business being valued, such as the number of patients for a general medical practice or the number of customers for a plumbing business. Value businesses, not equity: Chapter 4 classified multiples into equity multiples (where equity value is scaled to equity earnings or book value) and enterprise value multiples (where the value of the business is scaled to operating earnings, cash flows, or the book value of capital). Given the wide differences in equity claims and the use of debt across private businesses, focusing on enterprise value multiples is better than on equity multiples. In other words, valuing the entire business and then working out the value of equity is better than valuing equity directly. Start with a large dataset: Because transactions with private businesses are infrequent, starting with a large dataset of companies and collecting all transaction data is best. This allows us to screen the data for transactions that look suspicious (and thus are likely to fail the arm\u2019s-length test). Adjust for timing differences: Even with large datasets of private transactions, timing differences will occur across transactions. While this is not an issue in a period where markets are stable, we should make adjustments to the value (even if they are crude) to account for the timing differences. For instance, using June 2008 and December 2008 as the transaction dates, we would reduce the transaction prices from June 2008 by the drop in the public market (a small cap index like the Russell 5000 dropped by about 40% over that period) to make the prices comparable. Focus on differences in fundamentals: The notion that the value of a business depends on its fundamentals \u2014growth, cash flows, and risk\u2014cannot be abandoned just because we are doing relative valuation. The estimated value is likely to be more reliable if we can collect other measures of the transacted private businesses that reflect these fundamentals. For instance, obtaining not only the transaction prices of private businesses but also the growth in revenues recorded in these businesses in the period prior to the transactions and the age of the business (to reflect maturity and risk) would be useful.

We should stick with that principle, because the value based on future revenues/earnings is implicitly based on the assumption that the firm survives and succeeds. Adjust for nondiversification: The value estimated for the firm or equity, based on future earnings and revenues, must be discounted back to the present to arrive at the value today.

Thus, technology companies in the U.S. are treated as growth companies, whereas steel companies are considered mature. This definition clearly misses the vast differences in growth prospects across companies within any given sector. Technology companies like Intel and Microsoft are more mature businesses than growth businesses at this stage of their corporate evolution. Analyst growth estimates/growth history: A second categorization of companies into growth and mature companies is based on expected growth in future earnings, usually based on forecasts by equity research analysts. In the absence of forecast growth, some services use past growth in earnings as the growth measure. In both cases, firms that have high growth rates are considered growth companies; how high is a matter of both judgment and overall market growth. For instance, if earnings for the entire market are growing at 10% a year, companies might need to deliver 25% growth to be considered growth companies. With market earnings growth of only 5%, a 15% growth rate in earnings might qualify a company as a growth company. The limits of this approach are that it is circumscribed by its focus on earnings, as opposed to revenues or units sold. After all, many young high-growth companies might have exponential growth in revenues while losing money. Similarly, mature companies can post healthy earnings increases with improved efficiency and relatively little operating unit growth. Market-based measures: Morningstar, as part of its mutual fund tracking service, categorizes mutual funds into those investing in growth stocks and those investing in mature companies.

One feature shared by growth companies is that the numbers in these statements are in a state of flux. Not only can the numbers for the latest year be very different from numbers in the prior year, but they can change dramatically, even over shorter time periods. For many smaller, high-growth firms, for instance, the revenues and earnings from the most recent four quarters can be significantly different from the revenues and earnings in the most recent fiscal year (which might have ended only a few months ago). Private and public equity: It is accepted as conventional wisdom that the natural path for a young company that succeeds at the earliest stages is to go public and tap capital markets for new funds. There are four reasons why this transition is neither as orderly nor as predictable in practice. The first is that the private-to- public transition varies across different economies, depending on both institutional considerations and the development of capital markets. Historically, growth companies in the U.S. have entered public markets earlier in the life cycle than growth companies in Europe, partly because this is the preferred exit path for many venture capitalists in the U.S. The second reason is that even within any given market, access to capital markets for new companies can vary across time as markets ebb and flow. In the U.S., for instance, initial public offerings increase in buoyant markets and drop in depressed markets. During the market collapse in the last quarter of 2008, initial public offerings came to a standstill. The third reason is that the pathway to going public varies across sectors. Companies in some sectors, such as technology and biotechnology, get access to public markets much earlier in the life cycle than firms in other sectors, such as manufacturing and retailing. The net effect is that the growth companies we cover in this chapter draw on a mix of private equity (venture capital) and public equity for their equity capital. Put another way, some growth companies are private businesses, and some are publicly traded. Many of the latter group will still have venture capitalists and founders as large holders of equity. Finally, improvements in liquidity in the private share market and the increased willingness of public market investors to invest in private businesses have allowed some young companies to stay private for longer periods than they would have been able to a few years ago. Size disconnect: The contrast we drew in Chapter 1 between accounting and financial balance sheets, with the former focused primarily on existing investments and the latter incorporating growth assets into the mix, is stark in growth companies. The market values of these companies, if they are publicly traded, are often much higher than the accounting (or book) values because the former incorporate the value of growth assets and the latter often do not. In addition, the market values can seem discordant with the firm\u2019s operating numbers\u2014revenues and earnings. Many growth firms that have market values in the hundreds of millions or even billions can have small revenues and negative earnings. Again, the reason lies in the fact that the operating numbers reflect the firm\u2019s existing investments, and these investments might represent a very small portion of the firm\u2019s overall value. Use of debt: While the usage of debt can vary across sectors, the growth firms in any business tend to carry less debt, relative to their value (intrinsic or market), than more stable firms in the same business. This is simply because they do not have the cash flows from existing assets to support more debt. In some sectors, such as technology, even more mature growth firms with large positive earnings and cash flows are reluctant to borrow money. In other sectors, such as telecommunications, where debt is a preferred financing mode, growth companies generally have lower debt ratios than mature companies. Market history is short and shifting: We are dependent on market price inputs for several key components of valuation\u2014especially for estimating risk parameters (such as betas). Even if growth companies are publicly traded, they tend to have short and shifting histories. For example, an analyst looking at Google in early 2009 would have been able to draw on about four years of market history (a short period). But even those four years of data might not be particularly useful or relevant, because the company changed dramatically over that period. It went from revenues in the millions to revenues in the billions, from small operating profits to large operating profits, and from a small market capitalization to a large one.", "page_num": 391, "coordinates": [[95.3281206547448, 73.1630620969296], [95.3281206547448, 635.6630296594299], [531.6688850924262, 635.6630296594299], [531.6688850924262, 73.1630620969296]]}, {"text": "Although the degree to which these factors affect growth firms can vary across firms, they are prevalent in almost every growth firm.", "page_num": 391, "coordinates": [[75.32812180807812, 642.1630292845966], [75.32812180807812, 663.6630280447632], [536.264679977402, 663.6630280447632], [536.264679977402, 642.1630292845966]]}, {"text": "The shared characteristics of growth firms\u2014dynamic financials, a mix of public and private equity, disconnects between market value and operating data, a dependence on equity funding, and a short and volatile market history \u2014have consequences for both intrinsic and relative valuations.", "page_num": 392, "coordinates": [[75.32812180807812, 95.16317046025858], [75.32812180807812, 128.1631685572586], [536.5018615637247, 128.1631685572586], [536.5018615637247, 95.16317046025858]]}, {"text": "Intrinsic Value If a company\u2019s intrinsic value comes from its cash flows and risk characteristics, we will run into problems while valuing growth companies that can be traced back to where they are in the life cycle.

While we assume that these expenses are associated with existing assets, that assumption might not hold up in a growth company.

In general, delivering a given growth rate becomes more difficult as a company gets bigger. Success attracts competition: A small company can operate under the radar and sometimes show exceptional profitability. As the company grows, though, its success attracts attention from larger and more predatory competitors, often possessing more significant resources. This competition, in turn, results in lower profitability and value for growth.

Market value versus book value ratios and volatile market value: The conventional practice of estimating the weights to use for debt and equity in the cost of capital computation is to use market values for both. With growth firms, we should follow the same practice, but the volatility in stock prices can result in weights that change with the prices. In particular, a drop in the stock price can lead to a much higher debt ratio and potentially a lower cost of capital for a firm; this will strike some as counterintuitive. Changing risk for the firm over time: If computing the current risk parameters and debt ratio for a growth firm is difficult, the task is complicated further by a simple fact. On both dimensions, growth firms can be expected to change over time, leading to discount rates that vary across the years.

Convertible debt and preferred stock: When growth firms raise funds from nonequity investors, they seldom use conventional debt\u2014bank loans and straight bonds. More common is the use of the convertible debt, either in the form of bank loans with equity sweeteners or convertible bonds. The key advantage of using hybrids such as these is that interest payments are kept low in return for providing equity options to lenders. Because only debt should be subtracted to get to equity values, we should break convertible debt into debt and equity components, with the equity options going into the latter.

The first is that a growth company in a mature sector will (and should) bear little or no resemblance on either fundamentals or pricing multiples to the rest of the firms in the sector. The second reason is that even if every firm in the sector has growth potential, growth firms can vary widely in terms of risk and growth characteristics, thus making it difficult to generalize from industry averages. Base year values and choice of multiples: Most multiples are stated as a function of base year values for revenues, earnings, and book value. To estimate the PE ratio, for instance, we divide the stock price today by the earnings per share in the most recent fiscal year or four quarters. If a firm is young, the current values for these numbers will bear little resemblance to the firm\u2019s future potential. Using PE ratios to illustrate this point, this can lead to either very high PE ratios (because current earnings per share will be small relative to stock prices today) or not meaningful values (because earnings currently are negative and PE ratios cannot be computed) for many growth companies. Moving up the income statement to EBITDA or revenues offers little solace, because the values for these items will also be low relative to value. Controlling for growth differences: Because growth potential is the key dimension on which these firms vary, it becomes critical that we control for growth when comparing firms or extrapolating from industry averages. Unfortunately, the relationship between growth and value is too complex to lend itself to the simplistic generalizations that make relative valuation so attractive to both analysts and investors. Not only does the level of growth make a difference to value, but so does the length of the growth period and the excess returns that accompany that growth rate. Put another way, two companies with the same expected growth rate in earnings can trade at very different multiples of these earnings, because they vary on other dimensions.

The third reason is that the volatility in the numbers can cause big changes from year to year in items like operating margin and return on capital that are fundamental inputs into any valuation.

As we noted in the section on the dark side of valuing growth companies, analysts often allow for very long growth periods for growth firms and justify this assumption by pointing to past growth. As shown in Figure 10.5, both scale and competition conspire to lower growth rates quickly at even the most promising growth companies. Growth periods that exceed ten years, especially when accompanied by high growth rates over these periods, are difficult to defend, because only a few companies have been able to accomplish this over time. Valuing your company to be the exception, well before it has established itself, is not a good practice. When you put your firm into stable growth, give it the characteristics of a stable growth firm. In keeping with the emphasis on preserving internal consistency, we should change the company\u2019s characteristics to reflect stable growth. With discount rates, as noted in the preceding section, this takes the form of using lower costs of debt and equity and a higher debt ratio. With reinvestment, the key assumption is the return on capital that we assume for the stable growth phase. While some analysts believe that the return on capital should be set equal to the cost of capital in stable growth, we would preserve some company-specific flexibility.

With social media companies, for instance, you could compute enterprise value per user by looking at publicly traded companies in the space, and apply that value to Snap\u2019s users. In February 2017, for instance, this approach would have yielded about $100 in market value (enterprise value) per user across all social media companies. Applying this to Snap\u2019s 170 million users yields a value of $17 billion for its operating users. The benefit of using this approach is that it yields values, even in very young sectors, where companies have little to show in terms of revenues and earnings. The cost is that you are taking it on trust that the scaling metric is correlated with future revenues and earnings. A more complete version of this approach would look for variables that explain differences in value per user across companies and adjust for those differences when valuing Snap. For instance, Facebook\u2019s users are valued by the market at close to $150/user and Twitter\u2019s users are valued at only $40/user, with the gap in values largely attributable to user intensity (measured by the number of minutes spent each day on the platform). Because a typical Snap user spent 28 minutes a day in early 2017 on its platform, about halfway between the hour a day spent on Facebook and the 4 minutes a day on Twitter in 2016, it would then command a value per user of about $95/user. Scale to revenues: If every company in the sector has revenues, you could estimate enterprise value as a multiple of revenues and adjust the value upward for higher revenue growth and expected margins or downward for higher risk. Forward values: One reason why we have trouble using multiples with growth companies is that the current numbers are not representative of what we expect the firm to look like in the future. One way around this problem is to use the forecast revenues and other operating numbers to estimate value. With Snap, we draw on our earlier estimates of future revenues and earnings.

While the growth rate for earnings for mature firms can be high as a result of improved efficiencies, the revenue growth is more difficult to alter. For the most part, mature firms register growth rates in revenues that, if not equal to, will converge on the economy\u2019s nominal growth rate. Margins are established: Another feature shared by growth companies is that they tend to have stable margins. The exceptions are commodity and cyclical firms, where margins vary as a function of the overall economy and even mature firms exhibit volatile margins. Although we will return to take a closer look at this subgroup later in the book, even these firms have stable margins across the economic or commodity price cycle. Competitive advantages? The dimension on which mature firms reveal the most variation is in the competitive advantages they hold on to, manifested by the excess returns they generate on their investments. While some mature firms see excess returns go to zero or become negative with the advent of competition, other mature firms retain significant competitive advantages (and excess returns). Because value is determined by excess returns, the latter retain higher values relative to the former, even as growth rates become anemic. Debt capacity: As firms mature, profit margins and earnings improve, reinvestment needs drop off, and more cash is available for servicing debt. As a consequence, debt ratios should increase for all mature firms, although there can be big differences in how firms react to this surge in debt capacity. Some choose not to exploit any or most of the debt capacity, and they stick with financing policies they established as growth companies. Others overreact and don\u2019t just borrow, but borrow more than they can comfortably handle, given current earnings and cash flows. Still others take a more reasoned middle ground and borrow to reflect their improved financial status while preserving their financial health. Cash buildup and return: As earnings improve and reinvestment needs drop off, mature companies generate more cash from their operations than they need. If these companies do not alter their debt or dividend policies, cash balances will start accumulating in these firms.

Finding a multiple that works and comparable companies is easier with mature firms than with the growth firms we analyzed in the preceding two chapters. However, the fact that each multiple we use gives us a different estimate of value can be problematic. Put another way, relative valuation is a subjective process. The same company can be assigned very different values, depending on whether we are using a firm or equity multiple; whether that multiple is stated as a function of revenues, earnings, and book value; and the companies we pick to be its comparables. With mature firms, the problem we face is not that we cannot estimate a relative value, but that there are too many values to choose from. Management change: The multiples that we compute for revenues, earnings, and book value reflect the mature firm as it is managed today. To the extent that changing the firm\u2019s management could change all these numbers, we are faced with the same problem that we were with discounted cash flow valuation. How do we best reflect, in a relative valuation, the potential for management change and the consequent increase in value?

The accounting aftermath of acquisitions\u2014the creation of goodwill as an asset and its subsequent treatment\u2014can affect both earnings and book value, making multiples based on either number dicey.

Mature companies can make large changes to their debt ratios overnight\u2014 debt for equity swaps, recapitalizations\u2014and some multiples can be affected dramatically by such actions. In general, equity multiples, such as PE and price-to-book ratios, change more as financial leverage changes than enterprise value or firm multiples, which are based on the collective value of both debt and equity. A stock buyback, using borrowed funds, can reduce market capitalization dramatically (by reducing the shares outstanding), but it will have a much smaller impact on enterprise value (because we are replacing equity with debt).

Analysts who focus on the former without paying much attention to the latter sometimes use earnings growth rates to estimate revenues and overvalue mature companies. Stable growth rate models with unsustainable growth rates: The advantage of assuming that a growth rate is sustainable forever is that it allows us to dispense with cash flow estimates beyond that point and compute a terminal value.

The first is that the growth rate cannot exceed the economy\u2019s nominal growth rate, with the nominal risk-free rate operating as a proxy for this growth rate. The second constraint is that the firm\u2019s risk profile and investment returns should also be consistent with stable growth, with risk converging on the average firm\u2019s risk, and excess returns moving toward, if not to, zero. Analysts valuing mature companies sometimes overlook one or both of these assumptions, using stable-growth models for firms with growth rates higher than the risk-free rate and/or accompanying this growth rate with risk-and-return assumptions that are incompatible with a growth firm.

This is absolutely true in the U.S. and is partially true in most other parts of the world. The second benefit of debt financing is more subtle. The use of debt, it can be argued, induces managers to be more disciplined in project selection. In other words, the managers of a company funded entirely by equity, and with strong cash flows, have a tendency to become lazy. For example, if a project turns bad, the managers can hide evidence of their failure under large operating cash flows, and few investors notice the effect in the aggregate. But if those same managers use debt to fund projects, bad projects are less likely to go unnoticed.

One is the direct cost of going bankrupt, such as legal fees and court costs, which can eat up a significant portion of the value of the assets of a bankrupt firm. The other (and perhaps just as damaging) cost is the effect on operations of being perceived as being in financial trouble. Thus, when customers learn that a company is in financial trouble, they tend to stop buying the company\u2019s products. Suppliers stop extending credit, and employees start looking for employment elsewhere. Borrowing too much money can create a downward spiral that ends in bankruptcy. Agency costs arise from the different and competing interests of equity investors and lenders in a firm. Equity investors see more upside from risky investments than lenders do. Consequently, left to their own devices, equity investors tend to take more risk in investments than lenders would want them to. They also alter financing and dividend policies to serve their interests. As lenders become aware of this potential, they alter the terms of loan agreements to protect themselves in two ways. One is by adding covenants to these agreements, restricting investing, financing, and dividend policies in the future; these covenants create legal and monitoring costs. The other way is by assuming that there will be some game-playing by equity investors and by charging higher interest rates to compensate for expected future losses. In both instances, the borrower bears the agency costs. As firms borrow more money today, they lose the capacity to tap this borrowing capacity in the future.

We suggest that a much simpler lesson is embedded in the financing matching principle. Companies often use a bewildering array of debt and justify this complexity on the basis of cheapness, defined purely in terms of interest payments. Note that, if we follow this path, short-term debt will be cheaper than long- term debt in most periods, just as borrowing money in lower-inflation currencies (yen, dollar, euro) will be cheaper than borrowing money in high-inflation currencies (peso, ruble). Rather than trying to assign different costs to each layer of debt, we recommend a consolidation of all debt with a composite cost of debt attached to it.

One or more large institutional investors may introduce shareholder proposals designed primarily to improve corporate governance, holding the threat of more extreme action over the heads of managers. A mix of pension funds and private investors may show a willingness to confront incumbent managers. These institutional investors, with the weight of their large stockholdings, can present proposals to stockholders to change policies that they feel are inimical to shareholder interests. Often, these proposals are centered on corporate governance. Changing how the board of directors is chosen and removing anti-takeover clauses in the corporate charter are common examples. Proxy contests occur where an investor who is unhappy with how the firm is being run challenges the incumbent managers for proxy votes. With sufficient votes, the investor can get representation on the board and might be able to change management policy. In most companies, investors vote with their feet\u2014 selling their stockholdings when dissatisfied\u2014and thus concede power to incumbent managers.

While forced management turnover was uncommon outside the U.S. until recent years, it is becoming more frequent. Hostile acquisition: The fourth and most extreme method is a hostile acquisition of the firm by an investor or another firm. The incumbent management is usually replaced after the acquisition, and management policy is revamped. Investor pressure, CEO turnover, and proxy contests are all internal processes for management discipline. When these fail, the only weapon stockholders have left is to hope the firm will become the target of a hostile acquisition, where the acquirer will take over the company and change how it is run. For hostile acquisitions to be effective as a management-disciplining mechanism, several pieces have to fall into place. First, firms that are badly managed and run should be targeted for acquisitions.

In some cases, the incumbent managers might own large-enough stakes in the firm to stifle any challenge to their leadership. The time-honored way to protect incumbent management is to issue shares with different voting rights. In its most extreme form, the incumbent managers hold all the shares with voting rights and issue only nonvoting shares to the public.

Consider a firm like Oracle, where founder/CEO Larry Ellison owns almost 30% of the outstanding stock. Even without a dispersion of voting rights, he can effectively stymie hostile acquirers.

The impetus for this reform has come from institutional investors who have grown tired of being ignored by managers when confronted with clear evidence of poor decisions.

Flat revenues or revenues that grow at less than the inflation rate indicate operating weakness. It is even more telling if these patterns in revenues apply not only to the company being analyzed but also to the overall sector. This would eliminate the explanation that the revenue weakness is due to poor management (and thus can be fixed by bringing in a new management team). Shrinking or negative margins: The stagnant revenues at declining firms are often accompanied by shrinking operating margins, partly because firms are losing pricing power and partly because they are dropping prices to keep revenues from falling further. This combination results in deteriorating or negative operating income at these firms, with occasional spurts in profits generated by asset sales or one-time profits. Asset divestitures: If one of the features of a declining firm is that existing assets are sometimes worth more to others, who intend to put them to different and better uses, it stands to reason that asset divestitures will be more frequent at declining firms than at firms earlier in the life cycle. If the declining firm has substantial debt obligations, the need to divest becomes stronger, driven by the desire to avoid default or to pay down debt. Big payouts\u2014dividends and stock buybacks: Declining firms have few if any growth investments that generate value, existing assets that might be generating positive cash flows, and asset divestitures that result in cash inflows. If the firm does not have enough debt for distress to be a concern, it makes sense that declining firms not only pay out large dividends, sometimes exceeding their earnings, but also buy back stock. The downside of financial leverage: If debt is a double-edged sword, declining firms often are exposed to the wrong edge.

Note that this is true even if the firm has no corporate bonds, only bank loans outstanding. The difference is that the drop in value is visible with bonds, because they are traded, and is implicit with bank loans, which are not. So what are the consequences for valuing equity? Consider a simple example, in which you have valued a firm\u2019s operating assets at $800 million. Assume that the firm has debt outstanding, with a book value of $1 billion but a market value of only $500 million. In discounted cash flow valuation, the notion of a going concern requires us to stick with market value. We do this both for computing debt ratios in the cost of capital and for subtracting from firm value to get to the value of equity. However, with the example just cited, this puts us in the uncomfortable position of attaching a value of $300 million for equity (firm value minus market value of debt). This is simply because the market perceives a high chance of default in the firm. The tenuous nature of this solution can be illustrated by reestimating the value of equity in this firm if the firm is acquired by a healthy suitor who also assumes the debt.

Comparable firms: We can face two possible scenarios when valuing declining firms. One is when we are valuing a declining firm in a business where the remaining firms are all healthy and growing. Because markets value declining firms very differently from healthy firms, the challenge in this case is working out how much of a discount the declining firm should trade at, relative to the values being attached to healthy firms. We face the second scenario when we value a declining/distressed firm in a sector where many or even all of the firms share the same characteristic.

Following the standard practice for estimating the cost of debt, which is to look at the current market interest rate on a firm\u2019s bonds, can result in extremely high costs of debt. In January 2009, for instance, the yield to maturity on bonds issued by many firms with substantial default risk was in excess of 20%. If analysts estimate the cost of equity from a regression beta, they can find themselves facing a quandary, where the cost of equity is well below the pre-tax cost of debt. To overcome this problem, analysts try creative solutions, but many of these solutions have no basis in either theory or evidence. One is to use the book interest rate, obtained by dividing the interest expense by the book value of debt. Because much of the debt on the books was acquired when the firm was healthier, the book interest rate yields numbers for the cost of debt that seem more reasonable. The other is to arbitrarily hike the cost of equity above the pre-tax cost of debt, using the logic that equity is riskier than debt. While the logic is impeccable, the arbitrary nature of the adjustment is not. It is true that interest expenses are tax-deductible and that the after-tax cost of debt for most firms is much lower than the pre-tax cost of debt. We capture the benefit by multiplying the pre-tax cost by (1 \u2212 tax rate). Analysts who follow this practice with declining or distressed firms are missing a key part of the tax benefit argument.

Discount rate excuses: Analysts who use the current costs of equity and debt, both of which are likely to be elevated for distressed companies, argue that their valuations already reflect distress. There are two reasons to be skeptical. The first is that the cost of capital is not very responsive to distress in many firms. In other words, changing the costs of debt and equity, even by large amounts, often does not show up as a dramatically higher cost of capital.2 The second is that the risk parameters we estimate for cost of capital\u2014 betas and default spreads\u2014are designed to capture risk in going concerns; they reflect uncertainty about future cash flows.

In fact, using an exogenous estimate of the expected growth rate (from analyst estimates) on the current year\u2019s earnings or revenues to generate future values is not uncommon. Alternatively, we often map out an optimistic path to profitability for unprofitable firms and use this path as the basis for estimating expected cash flows. We could estimate the expected cash flows under all scenarios and use the expected values in our valuation. Thus, the expected cash flows would be much lower for a firm with a significant probability of distress. Note, though, that, contrary to conventional wisdom, this is not a risk adjustment. We are doing what we should have been doing in the first place\u2014estimating the expected cash flows correctly. If we wanted to risk-adjust the cash flows, we would have to adjust the expected cash flows downward even further using a certainty equivalent.8 If we do this, though, the discount rate used would have to be the risk-free rate, not the risk-adjusted cost of capital. As a practical matter, adjusting expected cash flows for the possibility of distress is very difficult. Not only do we need to estimate the probability of distress each year, we have to keep track of the cumulative probability of distress as well.

It is true that good management and the right strategic and business choices can make some cyclical firms less exposed to movements in the economy. However, the odds are high that all cyclical companies will see revenues decrease in the face of a significant economic downturn. Unlike firms in many other businesses, commodity companies are, for the most part, price takers. In other words, even the largest oil companies have to sell their output at the prevailing market price. Not surprisingly, the revenues of commodity companies are heavily impacted by the commodity price. In fact, as commodity companies mature and output levels off, almost all the variance in revenues can be traced to where we are in the commodity price cycle. When commodity prices are on the upswing, all companies that produce that commodity usually benefit, whereas during a downturn, even the best companies in the business see the effects on operations. The cycles can be long, unpredictable, and sometimes have structural breaks: Especially with commodities, the cycles can stretch over decades rather than years, with big differences across cycles. In some cases, the cycle can break as technological, manufacturing, or economic shifts make a commodity less or more attractive. This does make it not only more difficult to forecast how a current cycle will play out but also to pinpoint where in the cycle you are, at any point in time. Volatile earnings and cash flows: The volatility in revenues at cyclical and commodity companies is magnified at the operating income level because these companies tend to have high operating leverage (high fixed costs). Thus, commodity companies might have to keep mines (mining), reserves (oil), and fields (agricultural) operating even during low points in price cycles, because the costs of shutting down and reopening operations can be prohibitive. Volatility in earnings flows into volatility in equity values and debt ratios: While this does not have to apply for all cyclical and commodity companies, the large infrastructure investments that are needed to get these firms started has led many of them to be significant users of debt financing. Thus, the volatility in operating income that we referenced earlier manifests itself in even greater swings in net income. Even the healthiest firms can be put at risk if a macro move is very negative: Cyclical and commodity companies are exposed to cyclical risk over which they have little control. This risk can be magnified as we move down the income statement, resulting in high volatility in net income, even for the healthiest and most mature firms in the sector. It is easy to see why we have to be more concerned about distress and survival with cyclical and commodity firms than with most others. An extended economic downturn or a lengthy phase of low commodity prices can put most of these companies at risk. Finite resources: Commodity companies have one final shared characteristic. This planet has a finite quantity of natural resources. If oil prices increase, we can explore for more oil, but we cannot create oil. When valuing commodity companies, this will not only play a role in what our forecasts of future commodity prices will be, but it might also operate as a constraint on our normal practice of assuming perpetual growth (in our terminal value computations).", "page_num": 514, "coordinates": [[95.3281206547448, 301.6630592880959], [95.3281206547448, 717.6630352987629], [531.6689466924227, 717.6630352987629], [531.6689466924227, 301.6630592880959]]}, {"text": "In summary, then, when valuing commodity and cyclical companies, we have to grapple with the consequences of economic and commodity price cycles and how shifts in these cycles will affect revenues and earnings.

Thus, with a cyclical firm that has reported depressed earnings in a recessionary environment, we replace these earnings with normalized earnings. But we combine these earnings with capital expenditure, working capital, and cost of financing numbers extracted from the recessionary year. Inconsistent growth: Consider the cyclical company with low earnings that we discussed in the preceding section. If the problems are entirely the result of the aggregate economy\u2019s sluggishness, we should expect robust growth in earnings as the economy recovers. In fact, the estimates of earnings growth for cyclical companies often reflect this optimism, especially at the start of the recovery.

The disadvantage is that the use of absolute numbers over time can lead to normalized values being misestimated for any firm that changed its size over the normalization period. In other words, using the average earnings over the last five years as the normalized earnings for a firm that doubled its revenues over that period will understate the true earnings. Relative average over time: A simple solution to the scaling problem is to compute averages for a scaled version of the variable over time. In effect, we can average profit margins over time, instead of net profits, and apply the average profit margin to revenues in the most recent period to estimate normalized earnings. We can employ the same tactics with capital expenditures and working capital by looking at ratios of revenue or book capital over time, rather than the absolute values. Sector averages: In the first two approaches to normalization, we are dependent on the company\u2019s having a long history. For cyclical firms with a limited history or a history of operating changes, looking at sector averages to normalize might make more sense. Thus, we will compute operating margins for all steel companies across the cycle and use the average margin to estimate operating income for an individual steel company. The biggest advantage of this approach is that sector margins tend to be less volatile than individual company margins. However, this approach fails to incorporate the characteristics (operating efficiencies or inefficiencies) that might lead a firm to be different from the rest of the sector.", "page_num": 521, "coordinates": [[95.3281206547448, 73.16299988893218], [95.3281206547448, 284.66298769243303], [531.6747475420882, 284.66298769243303], [531.6747475420882, 73.16299988893218]]}, {"text": "By most accounts, in early 2009 Toyota was considered the best-run automobile company in the world.

Because the market price is observable for many of these investments, accounting rules have tilted toward using market value (actual or estimated) for these assets. To the extent that some or a significant portion of the assets of a financial services firms are marked to market, and the assets of most nonfinancial services firms are not, we face two problems. The first is in comparing ratios based on book value (both market-to-book ratios such as price-to-book and accounting ratios such as return on equity) across financial and nonfinancial services firms.

Rather than viewing debt as a source of capital, most financial services firms view it as raw material. In other words, debt is to a bank what steel is to a manufacturing company\u2014something to be molded into other products that can then be sold at a higher price and yield a profit. Consequently, capital at financial services firms is narrowly defined as including only equity capital. This definition of capital is reinforced by the regulatory authorities, who evaluate the equity capital ratios of banks and insurance firms. Defining debt: The definition of what comprises debt also is murkier with a financial services firm than it is with a nonfinancial services firm. For instance, should deposits made by customers into their checking accounts at a bank be treated as debt by that bank? Especially on interest-bearing checking accounts, there is little distinction between a deposit and debt issued by the bank. If we do categorize this as debt, the operating income for a bank should be measured prior to interest paid to depositors.

With financial services firms, we would skip this step for two reasons. First, financial services firms tend to be much more homogeneous in terms of capital structure. They tend to have similar financial leverage primarily due to regulations. Second, and this is a point made earlier, debt is difficult to measure for financial services firms. In practical terms, this means that we will use the average levered beta for comparable firms as the bottom-up beta for the firm being analyzed.

Banks and insurance companies have to maintain equity (in book value terms) at specified percentages of their activities. When a company is paying out more in dividends, it is retaining less in earnings; the book value of equity increases by the retained earnings. In recent years, in keeping with a trend that is visible in other sectors as well, financial services firms have increased stock buybacks as a way of returning cash to stockholders. In this context, focusing purely on dividends paid can provide a misleading picture of the cash returned to stockholders. An obvious solution is to add the stock buybacks each year to the dividends paid and to compute the composite payout ratio.

Consequently, valuing the equity directly in a financial services firm by discounting cash flows to equity at the cost of equity is far easier. The second aspect is that capital expenditures and working capital, which are required inputs to estimating cash flows, are often not easily estimated at financial services firms. In fact, much of the reinvestment that occurs at these firms is categorized under operating expenses.

The reinvestment made by the firm is often buried in the operating expenses (rather than showing up separately as capital expenditures). The failure to record the book values of intangible assets makes measures like return on equity and capital, widely used to determine the quality of a firm\u2019s investments, unreliable. In addition to all the standard variables that affect risk in a company, firms with intangible assets are susceptible to an additional risk. Lenders are wary of lending to firms with intangible assets, because monitoring these assets can be difficult. In addition, the values of some intangible assets, like human capital, can dissipate overnight if a firm gets into trouble or has its reputation besmirched. Estimating when a firm with intangible assets gets to steady state can range from simple to complex. Consider a simple scenario first. A biotechnology firm derives almost all its growth from a single blockbuster drug, with a patent expiring in seven years. Having a competitive advantage that comes with a time expiration stamp makes the judgment on when the company will hit stable growth very simple. A more complex scenario is a firm with a well-regarded brand name. Given the durability of consumer brand name as a competitive advantage, analysts face a much tougher task estimating when to put the firm into stable growth. The final and most difficult scenario is a firm whose biggest intangible asset is human capital, such as consultants at McKinsey or traders at a private equity fund. Because locking in human capital is very difficult, these firms can lose their best assets overnight to the highest bidder. Figuring out how or why these firms manage to hold on to their best personnel is a central component of valuing them correctly.

When we examine the options outstanding at a firm, we are looking at a mix of vested and nonvested options. The nonvested options should be worth less than the vested options, but the probability of vesting depends on how in-the-money the options are and the period left for an employee to vest. Illiquidity: Employee options cannot be traded. As a result, employee options are often exercised before maturity, making them less valuable than otherwise similar traded options that are marketable. In a comprehensive study of 262,931 option exercises of 10-year employee options between 1996 and 2003 by U.S. companies, Brooks, Chance, and Cline noted that 92.3% exercise early. On average, they find that exercise takes place 2.69 years after vesting, with 4.71 years left to expiration. Put another way, an employee option with a stated maturity of ten years is usually exercised in 5.29 years. Stock price or stock value: While conventional option pricing models are built around using the current market price as a key input, we do come up with estimates of value per share when we value companies. These estimates can be very different from current stock prices. We have to consider whether we want to use our estimates of value per share, rather than the market prices, to preserve valuation consistency. Dilution: Unlike listed options on exchanges, where the exercise of the option has no impact on the number of shares outstanding or the share price, the exercise of employee options can alter both. Tax consequences: Firms are allowed to deduct the difference between the stock and the exercise price of an option at exercise, and a potential tax saving exists at the time of the option exercise. This potential tax benefit reduces the drain on value created by having options outstanding.

The first is that the accounting treatment of what comprises capital expenditures at these firms is inconsistent with the accounting treatment of capital expenditures at manufacturing firms. R&D expenses, brand-name advertising, and employee recruitment and training expenses are treated as operating, rather than capital, expenses. As a result, both the earnings and book value numbers at these firms are skewed, and using them in valuation can lead to poor estimates of value. We examined ways of correcting for this accounting inconsistency and the resulting effect on value. In general, firms that can convert R&D expenditures more efficiently and profitably into commercial products will see their estimated values increase as a result of the correction. Firms that spend significant amounts on acquiring intangible assets, with little to show for it in terms of higher earnings, will see their estimated values decrease.", "page_num": 643, "coordinates": [[76.78513488161924, 204.84687386261135], [76.78513488161924, 464.0283807622564], [535.1881459104195, 464.0283807622564], [535.1881459104195, 204.84687386261135]]}, {"text": "The second issue we considered is the use of equity options to compensate employees.

In some emerging-market economies, the exchange rate for foreign currencies is fixed, creating the illusion of stability, but significant shifts occur every time the currency is revalued or devalued. Finally, as noted in Chapter 6, the absence of long-term default-free bonds in a currency denies us one of the basic inputs into valuation: the risk-free rate. Country risk: Substantial growth is occurring in emerging-market economies, but this growth is accompanied by significant macroeconomic risk. Thus, the prospects of an emerging-market company depend as much on how the country in which it operates does as they do on the company\u2019s own decisions. Put another way, even the best-run companies in an emerging economy will find themselves hurt badly if that economy collapses, politically or economically. Unreliable market measures: When valuing publicly traded companies, we draw liberally from market-based measures of risk. To illustrate, we use betas, estimated by regressing stock returns against a market index, to estimate costs of equity and corporate bond ratings and interest rates to estimate the cost of debt. In many emerging markets, both these measures can be rendered less useful if financial markets are not liquid and companies borrow from banks (rather than issuing market-traded bonds). Information gaps and accounting differences: While information disclosure requirements have become more stringent globally, the rules still require that much less information be disclosed in emerging markets than in developed markets. In fact, it is not unusual for significant and material information about earnings, reinvestment, and debt to be withheld in some emerging markets, making it more arduous to value firms in these markets. Along with the information gaps are differences in accounting standards that can make comparing numbers for emerging-market companies with developed-market firms difficult. Inflation accounting, uncommon in the U.S. and Western Europe, is still used in some emerging markets, with differences in tax treatment adding to the confusion. Corporate governance: The question of how much power stockholders have over managers is a global one, but emerging-market companies pose some of the most difficult challenges, because of both history and environment. Many emerging-market companies used to be family-owned businesses. Although they might have made the transition to being publicly traded companies, the families retain control through a variety of devices\u2014shares with different voting rights, pyramid holdings, and cross-holdings across companies.

Unfortunately, some of them follow up by then ignoring country risk, arguing that the switch to a developed-market currency should make this risk go away. It is clearly not that easy to eliminate country risk. Valuations based on this assumption will generate values that are too high for emerging-market companies. Mistaking expected cash flows for risk-adjusted cash flows: Chapter 3 noted that many analysts claim to have adjusted their cash flows for country risk by building into the expected cash flows the possibility and consequences of bad outcomes. Note that computing an expected value across multiple scenarios does not comprise risk adjustment and that either the cash flow or the discount rate has to be explicitly adjusted to reflect risk. Assuming that beta captures country risk: Because beta is generally our measure of firm-specific risk, some analysts believe that it is the best place to reflect country risk. Companies in higher-risk countries, they argue, will have higher betas and higher costs of equity. The problem, however, is that no easy way exists to incorporate country risk into the betas. If betas are estimated against the local index, the average beta across stocks in that market (no matter how risky the market is) should be 1. If betas are estimated against the S&P 500 or a global index, there is a chance that the beta might reflect country risk, but this is unlikely, given the small size of emerging-market companies (relative to the broader global indices). Double-counting (or triple-counting) risk: At the other extreme are analysts who are so sensitized by country risk that they try to build it into every dimension of value. These analysts use higher risk-free rates (incorporating a default risk spread for the country into the risk-free rate) and higher equity risk premiums (augmenting mature market premiums) and haircut or reduce expected cash flows (to reflect the same country risk).

Using two Indian companies to illustrate this point, consider Infosys, an Indian technology company that derives most of its revenues from the U.S. and developed Europe, and Bharat Telecom, an Indian telecom company with substantial investments in Africa.

With emerging-market companies, this approach provides a lifeline for estimating more meaningful and precise betas. However, we would expand on the notion of \u201ccomparable firms\u201d to include not only firms that operate in the same business in the country in which the company being valued is domiciled, but also companies listed in other markets. To analysts who worry about using the betas computed in other markets (that may be safer or riskier than the company\u2019s home market), we present two counterpoints. The first is that beta is a relative measure of risk; no currency is attached to it. The second is that the country risk premium, rather than the beta, takes care of country risk differences. If we accept the proposition that comparable firms can include firms in other markets, the final question to address is whether we should segregate companies based on whether they are in emerging markets or developed markets. The answer depends on the sector in which the company operates. With oil and aerospace companies, where operating risks are similar across markets and the products are sold into a global market, we are open to using all companies listed globally, in both developed and emerging markets. With telecommunications and consumer products companies, it can be argued that the same product or service (water, electricity, phone service) that is nondiscretionary in a developed market can be discretionary in emerging markets, where large proportions of the population may still be lacking these services (but will acquire them if the economy does well). In these cases, we would use only emerging-market companies as our comparable firms to estimate betas. For default spread estimates: With unrated companies in the U.S., we argued that the synthetic rating should be the basis for the cost of debt. Because these synthetic ratings were computed using the interest coverage ratio, there is no reason why we cannot do the same for emerging-market companies. In effect, we could use the interest coverage ratio for an Indian or Brazilian company to compute a rating, based on the lookup table we developed in Chapter 2, and then estimate a default spread based on the rating. Two estimation issues must be confronted in the process. First, the table that we use to estimate the ratings was developed using rated companies in the U.S. If we were looking at markets that have interest rates similar to those in the U.S., the table should still provide reasonable ratings. However, in emerging markets that have much higher inflation and interest rates, using this table may result in ratings that are too low even for safe companies.4 Second, the synthetic rating we obtain for a company will not reflect the default risk of the country in which the company operates. Consequently, when we compute the cost of debt for an emerging-market company, we may have to consider adding two default spreads to the risk-free rate\u2014one for the company\u2019s default risk and another for the country\u2019s default risk:", "page_num": 661, "coordinates": [[102.36873548463583, 73.5138714662287], [102.36873548463583, 690.5708377555201], [529.1672727405427, 690.5708377555201], [529.1672727405427, 73.5138714662287]]}, {"text": "In effect, an AA-rated Argentine company will have a higher dollar cost of debt than an AA-rated U.S. company, because the former will have the default spread for Argentina added onto its cost of debt.", "page_num": 662, "coordinates": [[103.67054343039383, 121.6808854592698], [103.67054343039383, 164.64054766928336], [529.0820572385885, 164.64054766928336], [529.0820572385885, 121.6808854592698]]}, {"text": "To estimate the costs of equity for Gerdau Steel and Tata Motors, we first estimate the average unlevered beta for comparable firms.

In valuing these companies, we face four issues: working with local currencies that are unstable and where risk-free rates can be difficult to estimate, an overlay of country risk, an absence of key information required for valuation, and poor corporate governance. In many emerging-market company valuations, we see either an unwillingness to confront these issues (ignoring accounting differences and corporate governance issues) or the adoption of simplistic rules (such as adding a country default spread to the cost of equity of every company in a market to reflect country risk).", "page_num": 679, "coordinates": [[76.33257656947583, 533.3592057194594], [76.33257656947583, 693.1744536470322], [535.6380552628747, 693.1744536470322], [535.6380552628747, 533.3592057194594]]}, {"text": "This chapter developed a systematic framework for valuing emerging-market companies.

Then we determined how exposed a specific company in that market is to that country risk (through the use of a beta or lambda). We also argued for using a sector-based beta to estimate the cost of equity to avoid the skewed values that will emerge from a conventional regression against a narrow, local index. With missing information, we either look for an alternative measure for the data, based on existing financial statements, or use the link between growth and fundamentals to estimate the absent inputs. We make no explicit adjustment for poor corporate governance, because the company\u2019s cash flows and discount rates today should reflect not only the quality of management but also the chance that the management can be changed.

Risk parameters available for the aggregate but not for the pieces: If we treat a multinational company as a portfolio of companies in different businesses and markets, we should use a weighted average of the risk parameters for each of the companies to estimate the risk for the consolidated company to derive its value. The first problem we often encounter is that getting these risk parameters is difficult, because the consolidated company (GE, Siemens) is the one that trades, not the individual pieces. The second problem is that as the weights on businesses/countries change over time, as they will if the growth rates are different, the weighted parameters have to be adjusted to reflect these changes. Taxes reflect a mix of marginal tax rates and jurisdictions: The marginal and effective tax rates of a multinational firm reflect the different tax rates it pays on its different income, rather than the marginal tax rate of the domestic market. To decide which tax rates to use in estimating cash flows and discount rates, we not only have to look at where the company generates its income, but also consider whether the firm can move its income into lower-tax locales and the consequences for tax rates. Large centralized costs: As a company branches into multiple businesses and many countries, inevitably more and more costs will become centralized. One reason for this tendency is control, as the firm tries to keep tabs on risk and cash flows and to manage risk. The other reason is economies of scale, in which replicating the same function (accounting and marketing, for instance) in multiple divisions is avoided by having one company-wide accounting or marketing department. The problem with centralized costs is not just the magnitude of these expenses, but that these expenses then have to be allocated across different businesses and regions using some operating variable as a basis. For instance, centralized general and administrative (G&A) costs can be allotted to different divisions, based on revenues generated, and employee training and recruiting costs can be divided up based on the number of employees in each division. While both allocating mechanisms are reasonable, there is no way to check what the actual costs in each division are. Consequently, any earnings measures (EBITDA, operating income, or net income) computed at the divisional or regional level can be called into question. Intracompany transactions: One troublesome aspect of firms that operate in many regions and businesses is the prevalence of intracompany transactions. For instance, a company that is in both iron ore mining and steel production will have the steel business buying its raw materials from the iron ore business. The former will report the item as a cost, and the latter will report it as revenue, and the company overall will net out the two items. Two consequences can throw off valuations. The first is that although the company\u2019s net income might be unaffected by these transactions, the revenues and costs will be inflated by the volume of the trades. The second is that the prices at which these transactions are arranged might be artificial, driven more by tax and control considerations than the economics of the marketplace. After all, setting the price of iron ore too high (relative to what you would have paid in the market) will lower the income for the steel business but inflate the income for the mining business", "page_num": 685, "coordinates": [[100.65501528829085, 73.42871533445452], [100.65501528829085, 707.8696292914153], [529.7725500754979, 707.8696292914153], [529.7725500754979, 73.42871533445452]]}, {"text": "by exactly the same amount.

The presence of a financing arm within the company will exacerbate this issue. Complex holding structures: Although not all multibusiness, multinational companies have complex holding structures, the structure of these firms lends itself more readily to this problem. Multibusiness companies often set up quasi-independent or independent subsidiaries for some businesses and then have holdings in these subsidiaries that can be classified in a multitude of ways. For instance, Coca-Cola split off its bottling operations into an independent company in the 1980s and reduced its holding of that company to less than 50%, allowing it to escape consolidation.

To make a good assessment of the value of growth, we need information on two key variables\u2014reinvestment amounts (and rates) by business, and the returns generated on capital invested in each. Although obtaining this information for a single-business company is difficult enough, it is doubly so in complex companies where capital expenditures are often aggregated at the company level and book values of capital at the division level are either unavailable (because divisional balance sheets are not released) or not trustworthy (because capital has been allocated to different businesses). Furthermore, as the firm expands at different rates in different businesses and regions, the weighted growth rate changes. Discount rates: If different businesses have different risk characteristics, and operating in different parts of the world exposes companies to varying country risk, assessing risk (and cost of capital) for a multibusiness, global company creates two problems. The first is getting measures of risk for each part of the business, rather than for the firm overall. The beta of GE as a company is not very useful in assessing the risk and value of its aircraft business. The second problem is coming up with the weights to attach to each part of the business to arrive at a risk measure for the entire firm. As the growth rates in different businesses change, the weights also shift. The other input into discount rates is financial leverage, which is just as difficult to measure at the divisional level, both because the debt used by the company is not broken down by division and because the market value of equity is accessible only for the entire firm, not individual businesses. A final dilemma we face with both discount rates and cash flows is that a multinational company will generate cash flows in different currencies and often issue debt in multiple currencies. Because inflation rates, risk-free rates, and discount rates can vary by currency, we face a tangle of different estimates for the same input, depending on which currency we use for the estimates. Terminal value: When a firm is in multiple businesses, it is entirely likely that some of these businesses are already in stable growth, whereas others are in high growth. If we forecast cash flows until the entire firm is in stable growth, we will be forecasting cash flows for mature businesses for extended periods. There is one added complication.

Consider a multinational company that operates only in the U.S. and Western Europe and is in the specialty retailing and apparel businesses. Because there is very little difference in country risk across the regions that this firm operates in and only small differences in profitability and growth in its two businesses, not much would be gained by breaking it into its individual parts and valuing it.

One simple solution is to base the weights on the revenues or earnings in each business, in effect assuming that a dollar in revenues in one business is worth exactly the same amount as revenues in a different business.

We have to adjust the discount rate for the exposure that multinationals have to emerging- market risk. The simplest adjustment to make is to compute equity risk premiums for every market that a firm operates in and to take a weighted average of these numbers, using revenues or operating income as the base. A more complex adjustment would require that we compute lambdas (just as we did for emerging- market companies in Chapter 16) for the multinational against each market and then use these lambdas in conjunction with country risk premiums to compute a firm\u2019s cost of equity.

The first is that the risk- free rate to use in computing the cost of debt can vary across the different currencies in which the firms might actually borrow. This is a fairly simple problem to resolve, because the risk-free rate to use will be determined by the currency you chose to do the valuation in step 2. In other words, if you decide to do your valuation in U.S. dollars, the risk-free rate will be the U.S. Treasury bond rate, no matter what currency the actual borrowing is in. The second issue is the default spread, which can vary widely across the firm\u2019s different borrowings. If the multinational firm has a rating, we can use it to compute a default spread, which can then be added to the risk-free rate to compute the costs of debt, assuming in effect that the company faces the same cost of debt in every market. The final issue relates to the tax rate. While it is the marginal tax rate that should use the cost of debt, the reality is that the marginal tax rates can vary across the different countries that the firm operates in. One solution is to use the marginal tax rate of the country that the multinational is incorporated in. An even better alternative is to use the highest marginal tax rate, across the countries in which the company operates, arguing that interest expenses will be directed to that country to maximize tax benefits. Note that this works only if you have enough income in the higher tax locales to take advantage of the interest tax deduction. Debt ratios: In keeping with our objective of valuing the consolidated firm, the debt ratio we use will be based on the aggregated debt for the entire firm and the market value of all its equity.

Cost of debt: Although we will stick with the principle that the cost of debt is the sum of the risk-free rate and the default spread, the costs of debt that we estimate for the same company in different businesses/divisions can be different for two reasons. One is that we might be using different currencies to value different revenue streams; this can change the risk-free rate. The other reason is that we can estimate different default spreads for different parts of the same company, basing the spreads on the riskiness and the cash flows generated by each part.

In fact, conventional valuation models can be easily adapted to estimate the value of a user to Facebook, a rider for Uber, and a subscriber in Netflix. That said, the information needed to value these units is often either held back or opaquely provided by companies. It is ironic that companies that are quick to tout the number of users they have and ask to be priced on that number are unwilling to share information about those users that investors need to better judge their value or price. The accounting rule writers might want to consider what investors need to better assess unit value when they write rules specifically for user- or subscription-based companies. Accounting inconsistencies: Coupled with the information non-disclosure is another problem that we highlighted for companies with intangible assets. Just as accountants take the biggest capital expenditures (R&D) made by technology and pharmaceutical firms and treat them as operating expenses, the biggest investment for future growth made at user-based and subscription-based companies is the money spent in acquiring new users and subscribers, and that expenditure is routinely expensed. As with pharmaceutical companies, you can then argue that the income at user-based companies is understated and that the biggest assets that these companies have is not on their books. In fact, we will argue that the problem is more difficult to solve at these companies than it was at technology and pharmaceutical companies, because unlike R&D, which is separately reported as an operating expense, and thus can be recategorized as a capital expense, the costs of acquiring new users is hidden in SG&A expenses and often very difficult (if not impossible) to separate. User Diversity: Not all users and subscribers are of equal value. Thus, while the subscription revenue is roughly the same across subscribers for Netflix, which charges similar prices across the globe, the value of a user can vary widely across geographies and within the same market for companies like Uber. For instance, we will be valuing users/riders at Uber in the next section, but some Uber users use far more of its service than others and thus should be valued more highly. In fact, one proxy for risk in a user model might be the disparity in values across users, because a company that derives 90% of its value from 10% of its users is built on a riskier base than a company that has a more uniform value distribution.

That will overstate the value of a user. Revenues as cash flows: The one number that analysts often can estimate easily is the revenue per user or subscriber, at least on an average basis. In subscription-based models like Netflix, it comes from observing the price charged each subscriber, and in user-based models like Uber, it can be derived by dividing total revenues by the number of users. Estimating how much was spent on servicing existing users is much more difficult at either of these companies. Consequently, many user-based valuations consider revenues as cash flows, acting as if no costs are associated with servicing existing users and also that no taxes would have to be paid on the resulting income. You can value a Netflix subscriber on the assumption that the annual subscription revenue of about $120/subscriber, in 2017, is the cash flow for the year but that will overvalue a subscriber. New user magic: The value of a user-based company is the sum of the value of its existing users plus the value of any new users it will acquire over time. That said, the value of a new user will be less than that of an existing user, for a simple reason. It costs money to acquire new users. Here again, the absence of concrete information about user acquisition costs leads some to ignore the costs altogether and give new users the same value as existing users, resulting in inflated values for companies that spend considerable amounts to acquire these new users.

In the same vein, when valuing user-based companies, many expenses are either unrelated to servicing existing users or cannot be directly tied to acquiring new users that have to be incorporated in the valuation. Take Netflix, for instance, where an existing subscriber costs little to service, and delivers $120 in annual revenues.

We started with multinational, multibusiness companies and argued that companies that spread their tentacles across multiple businesses and many parts of the globe are difficult to value, because their cash flows from each business or region can have very different risk and growth characteristics. This chapter looked at two ways we can approach the valuation of these. The first is to value the company as a whole, using the weighted averages of risk parameters to estimate discount rates, which we then use to discount consolidated cash flows for the firm. The dangers here are that the weights will change over time, and as they do, so will the firm\u2019s fundamentals. The second way is to value the cash flow streams separately, using different risk measures and growth rates for each stream. Thus, emerging-market and risky business cash flows will be discounted at higher rates than developed-market and safer business cash flows. The aggregated value of the different businesses should yield a better estimate of the overall company\u2019s value.", "page_num": 731, "coordinates": [[76.08808735191289, 171.37426056581683], [76.08808735191289, 378.675003663862], [535.9142837792773, 378.675003663862], [535.9142837792773, 171.37426056581683]]}, {"text": "When we use relative valuation to value these companies, we run into the same valuation issues.

Alternatively, we can try to find comparable firms within each business and then use the information on how the market is pricing these companies to value the pieces that make up the larger firm.

First, if a transaction or judgment is to be based on that number, it should not come from an opaque process, a black box that only the analyst has access to. Thus, if we have valued a company, the inputs to the valuation should be explained and presented in such a way that users can not only see where the numbers came from but also the story that ties them together.

Over time, it will not only become a riskier company, but a riskier company with buyer\u2019s remorse, with lots of value-destroying, risky projects in its portfolio. Project-specific financing: In many cases, companies are explicit not only about how much they will borrow for a new project and at what rate, but also about how they plan to pay off the debt over the project\u2019s lifetime. For many analysts, this seems like an easy solution to the debt ratio problem, with many using the project debt mix to compute the cost of capital.

The first is that the debt ratio, even if given for a project, is in book value terms. It is stated as a percent of the cost of the project investment and not its value and that problem will get magnified in future years as the project ages and debt gets paid down. The second is that the amount of debt that a company uses to finance an individual project or asset usually has little to do with the debt capacity of that project or asset and has more to do with the company\u2019s debt standing. Thus, a company that has significant excess debt capacity can choose to fund a project entirely with debt and using that debt ratio (100 percent debt, no equity) will give it a very low cost of capital (equal to the after-tax cost of debt). Valuing the project with this low cost of capital will overvalue it, just as you will undervalue a later project that might be funded entirely with equity. Trust in accounting earnings: The process of getting from earnings to cash flows is no different for an individual asset or project than it is for a company. You start with accounting earnings, add back noncash expenses (like depreciation and amortization) and subtract out capital expenditures and change in working capital. The difference is that the earnings for a project or individual asset often are after allocated expenses, some of which might be attributable to the project and some of which might not. Analysts who estimate cash flows for projects based on stated accounting earnings will be misestimating those cash flows, underestimating them when projects are being allocated costs that are not attributable to them, and overestimating them when some project costs are being missed. Post-analysis garnishing: In earlier chapters, we pointed to the use of buzzwords to justify both more or less than estimated value.

Although it is true that companies pay down debt associated with individual projects, we recommend continuing to use the same debt ratio over time, because that debt that is paid down will be replaced with new debt on other projects. Only for stand-alone projects that have the capacity to carry their own debt do we recommend using project-specific debt ratios and adjusting them over time for debt repayment.1 Incremental cash flows: A simple rule in decision making is that decisions should be based on incremental and forward-looking cash flows. In the context of valuing projects and assets, this requires us to not take project earnings, at least as reported by accountants, at face value and instead go through the financial statements, line item by line item, asking two questions. First, what will happen to this line item if we take this project? Second, what will happen to this line item if we do not take this project? If the answer is the same to both questions, that line item is not incremental and should not be part of your analysis. To illustrate this, consider two examples. In the first, assume that you are looking at a line item for test market expenses of $50 million that have already been incurred for a project under consideration. Because that expense will be unchanged whether you take this project or not, it should be ignored; this is, of course, a classic sunk cost. In the second, consider a line item for allocated General and Administrative (G&A) costs of $50 million but assume that $40 million of these expenses are fixed expenses that would just be allocated elsewhere in the company if this project is not taken.

Some risks affect only one firm or a few firms, whereas other risks have consequences for a wider subset of firms and sometimes for the overall market. When assessing risk for valuation, it is therefore imperative that we first identify the marginal investors (active investors with large stockholdings) in a firm and look at risk through their eyes. If the marginal investor is diversified, the only risks that should affect value are the market or macro risks that cannot be diversified away. In contrast, though, if the marginal investor is undiversified or only partially diversified, we should look at a much broader set of risks, including firm-specific risks. In Chapter 9, this was the insight we used to derive total betas and costs of equity for entrepreneurs (who tend not to be diversified) and venture capitalists (who are only partially diversified). Continuous versus discrete risk: Risk can be divided into two categories. Continuous risk affects cash flows and value continuously over time. Examples are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk. Discrete or discontinuous risk might lie dormant for long periods but affect value significantly when it occurs. The risk of default and nationalization are examples.
