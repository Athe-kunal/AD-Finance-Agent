This is an insurance policy which guarantees the reimbursement of the unpaid debt by the credit insurer (Coface, Atradius, Euler Hermes, Zurich, SACE) in exchange for an insurance premium of between 0.10% and 2% of sales covered.8 It is rare that full compensation is paid out as the company will still have to pay the insurance excess, which will be between 10 and 30% of the amount of the debt. The insurance payout is made either when the purchaser of the company\u2019s goods is declared insolvent or at the end of the waiting period before payment.
