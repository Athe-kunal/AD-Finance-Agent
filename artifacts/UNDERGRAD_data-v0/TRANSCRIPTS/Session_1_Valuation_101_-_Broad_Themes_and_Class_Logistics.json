I think that's a good start. I think that's a good start. I think that's a good start. I think that's a good start. I think that's a good start. I think that's a good start. I think that's a good start. I think that's a good start. you you you you you you you you you torture you for the next 15 weeks and I can't wait for this to happen. I have four kids. They've all grown up now. All of them came and looked at NYU. None of them came to NYU. So when they were on their college expedition and they take you around the university and they lie to you. They say professors are always around. You can knock on their doors and go in. You've heard those pitches, right? I went with each of my kids on the NYU pitch. The Knicks are losing, but it is the biggest room that they can find in this building. So we're stuck with one thing I don't like about this room is because you don't have a desk in front of you. You can't put your name up. So, you know, it's it's more difficult for me to attach names to faces. I'm going to try. But before I talk about the class and what's coming, I'm going to do a quiz. question. If I asked you why you were taking this class, give me the reason you're in this class. And I'll give you the potential reasons. As I said, you don't have to tell anybody else. It's just basically for yourself. Is it because you think after you take this class, you're going to get rich like your neighbor, your friend who bought Bitcoin at 500 and now is very wealthy more honest with yourself. Maybe you've been told it's an easy A. It's not, but maybe you've been told that. And maybe you're doing this for the same reason most people buy Tesla or sell Bitcoin or do whatever else because everybody else is doing it. As I said, you don't have to tell me. I'm going to tell you why I think you should take this class in a few minutes or maybe not take this class in a few minutes. So basically it's the same class, exactly the same material. Okay. But here's the question that I have for you. If I ask you to describe valuation as a discipline, again, for the moment, make your choice, come back and talk about it for the rest of the day. Which of the following statements do you think best describes valuation? It's a science. I've never done valuation. You don't need to do valuation to be able to answer the question. The first. So here are the choices. You're a mature company. You've been around a long time. You have a business model. You have a lot of financials and you're in a stable economy. Second, you're a mature company, but the economy is in crisis. Doesn't have to be an emerging market economy. It could be a domestic economy in March of 2020. Remember, in the midst of COVID, we had no idea what was coming. inflation and what the Fed might do and whether the economy will open up. Final question. This is a personal question. There's no right answer. Each of us is more comfortable either working with numbers or with stories. she said it's a metaphor my jaw dropped and the rest of the class was about hidden meanings and things i didn't even have no had a meaning in the first place i remember coming out of that class with a singular conclusion i said never again am i going to subject myself to that kind of bullshit and i avoided the literature classes like the plague i'm not comfortable with this hidden but then you could take numbers class, numbers class, numbers degree, engineer, accountant, and then you took a numbers job. And who do you hang out with? Other numbers people. And what class are you in? Evaluation class, right? You think this is my, you know, this is my arena, but some of you, so let's, let's do a show of hands. How many of you think you're more naturally numbers people? I came to NYU in 1986 I was hired as an assistant professor so I land up in New York I went to UCLA and the first thing I noticed whether it's not as nice and they give me a class to teach it's called security analysis have any of you heard of this class it's a class. There were no books on valuation unless you wanted to use Ben Graham's security analysis. You know when the first edition of that book was published? 1934. Reflects the time it was written, right? Coming out of the Great Depression. If you ever wondered why Graham play out, 35 years later, they'd come back and say, you can teach the class, but I'd be too old to do it. So I said, I'll teach your damn security analysis class. I didn't use the word damn. It's the head of the department, after all. And I walked into the room, shut the door. And remember, this was 1986. There were no cameras in the classroom. They had no idea what I was doing inside that room. I could be teaching that fascinated with equity. You take those three words out. What are you left with? And I might as well teach a valuation class. They said, that's not right. We should call it valuation. I said, I agree. So if you look at the MBA course listings this class. Let me give you a few examples. One year into teaching this class, 1987, we're still downtown. And at that time, NYU's graduate business school was right next to the American Stock Exchange. I was teaching, I taught my valuation class in the morning. I come back to my office. I look out of my window and I can see the first question i was asked was how with the evaluation tools can you explain a one-day drop in the entire it's not one stock it's the entire market how do you explain a 22 drop i didn't know the answer but i tried this is going to be a pattern you notice me even when i don't know the answer i'll just make up stuff i tried but in the process i started, companies like Apple and Microsoft, when they went public in the 1980s, were already established companies in terms of a business model. But the first time in the 1990s, you saw these companies jump the queue and go public. I still remember the day in 1997, somebody in my class putfledged market crisis, but it's a in terms of entertainment companies no I'm sorry users basically because how every single question I have in this class gets triggered. Somebody puts up their hand and says, can you value a Netflix subscriber? Notice the question, not can you value Netflix? Because you can always value Netflix from the top down, but can you value a subscriber to Netflix? Can you? Help me out. How would you value a Netflix subscriber? What would you need to know? Long will you stay on as a subscriber? In user-based companies, this is based on what's called the churn rate. Now, how many times? And let's face it, subscription-based models are sticky. This morning, I was making a list of all the subscriptions I have. I said, really? I've been subscribing to that for four years. I've never even been there. So if I give you the expected life that a subscriber stays on and what you can collect from a subscriber, and if you could tell me what it costs you to service a subscriber, notification man why are you saying go home three weeks but you'll be back three weeks right we went home and we were gone for like a year and a half but I was teaching the class still from my home in La Jolla I don't live in New York I live in California for obvious reasons other than the fact that I like to pay taxes world you wished you were in. Actually, I have a YouTube video that you can see of my Boeing valuation from March 23rd of 2020, the absolute bottom of that crisis. But again, in the process of doing it, I learned about what to, in fact, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I tried to value Ukrainian mining companies I'd like to do, first, let me do the logistical part before I do this. Finally, we're in person. I mean, I taught this class entirely online one semester, 2021. My office is in the other building, 969. So if you want to find me, you can try, but I'm usually not there. Okay. which means for the next 15 weeks, I'm going to try to make it as difficult as possible for you to find me. For instance, I've discovered that if you take the stairs, nobody finds you. Because everybody takes the elevators. If you take the elevators. Now I remember one year when I was teaching this class at that time, you know, it used, there used to be a building called Coles where you have the new building now. So it used to be the gym for NYU. And I'd show up, you know, your grading. So if you get pissed off, it's me, you got to take it out on, but I'll be sending out their office hours and they'll do a review session each week where they work through problems from past quizzes. So take advantage of that. So with that lead in, what I'd like to do is talk a little bit about the broad themes for this class. And what I'm not testing you. Two plus three is five. Right hand, left hand, calculator, computer, North Pole, South Pole. It's not might be five, it could be five. It is five. And if you get any other answer, you're wrong. Physics is mostly a science, right? You all go to the 11th floor, you jump out of a window. Can you get a window open? I don't know, but let's say you jump out of a window. You don't fall in the company, right? A visionary teenager, but he does some, you know what the essence of a teenager is, I'm calling them corporate teenagers, what do they do? They do what teenage, and you remember these days, not that long ago, what do teenagers do? Every day they get up, they look in the mirror, they say, I have lots of potential, what can I do today to screw it all up? So there's an immense amount of uncertainty. when in doubt write a few more rules they want to convert valuation to science and they're convinced that if they write more rules it's going to become more scientific it's going nowhere valuation is definitely not a science so it must be an art right so let's take a a simpler example is painting an art not painting your house of my life trying to teach something that cannot be taught so if it's not a science and it pan and egg go in the trash and i remembered a very important lesson that i've remembered since spray the pan before you cook the egg you learn your safety zone and value companies that you don't feel comfortable valuing, because that's how you learn valuation. So that's the first thing. Second one, and this is something you see me return to over and over again, is I'm going to draw a contrast between two words that we use interchangeably in valuation that we should not. cash flows, growth, and risk. You have to understand the business to value a company because without understanding whether you're in a high margin business or a low margin business, what are you going to do? Probably my Zoom. Whatever it is, I have no idea. So values driven by cash flows, growth, and risk. You know what determines price? Demand and supply. You think we're in demand and supply everything's moving online so by the start of 2021 gamestop was on its pathway to a net the game was over the business and the stock price had dropped it was one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the in among u.s equities you know what shortings right people were selling it to return basically because they thought GameStop was coming back or because they thought the founder of Chewy, Ryan Cohen, was going to turn the company around. They were doing it because they wanted to get revenge. Against whom? Who were they trying to run out of business? Hedge funds. Why? Because they had big student loans and they're convinced that if Citadel hadn't done this, their student loan would have been half what it was. Whatever the reason, it was revenge. As I said, this class, I'm going to draw a contrast between value and price. We're going to talk first about value. I'm going to focus a lot on cash flows, growth, and risk. But many of you, when you go out there for jobs, you're not going to be valuing companies. You're going to be pricing them. What do you think banks do? They don't value companies. They price them. We're going to talk about how to price companies better. Because in pricing, here's what you do. You look at what other people are paying for similar. this is a class about valuing just about anything. And what we can't value, we will price. So this is not just about valuing, you know, publicly traded large companies. It's about private companies and public companies, young companies and old companies, developed market companies and emerging market companies. And guess what? The rules stay the same, no matter which of those companies. So we're going to start with that. million. It's an awful looking picture if you ask me. But because the Mona Lisa is worth so much, this must be worth 400 million. So we're going to talk about pricing as well. And in that process, we can talk about pricing, not just companies. We can talk about pricing. Real estate, remember, is all pricing all the time. You know what I mean by pricing? If you buy an apartment in New York City, first, you must be really rich. But if one Bitcoin, which is what people are? And that's a discussion we can have. And that's a fair discussion. But you'd be amazed at how often people say, what's the value of Bitcoin? Do not use the word value for assets that don't have cash flows. You can price Bitcoin. You can price a Mickey Mantle rookie card. But you cannot value those because there are no cash flows. And along the way, we'll also talk about sets of businesses or assets which have contingent cash flows, and we're going to use those to value not just young pharma companies, but a platform. How many times have you seen people say, well, I said, you probably are thinking right now that good valuation is all about numbers. And if you go to work for a bank, you're all Excel ninjas. You think every valuation is line item 15, you know, just get that line item right. And I think we need to step back. of those, but that's what you need as an answer. I'm going to use a margin of 20%. You know why that should surprise you? Because a typical automobile company has margins of 8, 10, 12%. A software company has margins of 30, 35%. So when I use a 20% margin and you need to get comfortable with the storytelling. And if you're a story, I'll tell you my vision for this class. If you're a number cruncher, by the end of this class, I hope you trust your imagination enough to be able to tell stories. Because remember, you've spent a lifetime bludgeoning that poor thing into the ground. Because at every step, if you're in a number cruncher class, if you come up with something imaginative, it's not even close. It's always the number crunches. You give me a hundred history majors, I can teach them enough valuation to be able to value companies next week. Give me a hundred engineers, I am screwed. So if you're a number cruncher, I need you to let go of that need. Because if you're a number cruncher, you always want closure, right? Until you get that absolute certainty, you got this right, you can't let go. You need to let go. theme for this class. I'm going to use a word that you probably don't expect to see in a valuation class. It's fate. What's fate got to do with it? Everything. I'd be upfront. I don't do consulting. I don't do expert witness work. In other words, I don't do valuation for others. So what's the only reason left to do valuation? or wherever you go and asking the priest you know you know can you prove to me that god exists and unless you have a priest who makes up stuff he's going to have faith probably pisses you off to no end because give me proof and faith is not something i can knocking on your doors and do you still have faith? Get used to that. That's the nature of investing. And most people don't have faith. So that's something you have to decide for yourself. And you might decide you have no faith. In which case, what should you do? Buy index funds and move on. Live the rest for the class. We're going to start with the first few sessions focused on the big picture, how things connect together. Now, the reason I do that is often when you start to dig into the inputs, it's easy to get lost. So when you talk about risk premiums, you're saying, why are we talking about this again? Betas, what does that got to do? The big picture is basically going to frame everything we're going to do in the class and where things fit in. has come into play. Probably going to value 15, 20 companies, very diverse from young startups to old companies. We'll value them. Just to depress you, I'll value Bed, Bath & Beyond. It's already depressing if you've gone into a Bed, Bath & Beyond, which I think is an incredibly depressing experience. But value is even more depressing. You say, how did the company ever get to this point in the first place? Then we're going to talk about pricing. And in the process, we're going to look at different multiples and how to do pricing better once you've got intrinsic valuation and pricing done we're going to talk about asset-based valuation what is that you look at a company and rather than value the whole company valued in pieces right now for instance we have to value ge basically passes away. There goes the business. It's called a key purse component. It's not just private businesses, right? We just mentioned Tesla. One of the questions I've always had with Tesla is what would you do if you woke up one day and you looked at the news and it said, Elon Musk checks into rehab. First, would you be surprised? Probably not, right? He's an amazing one is acquisition value what's different about valuation in m&a and the answer is nothing other than the fact that people like to overpay and their bank bankers basically want the deal to get done we'll talk about some of the ways in which bad deals get a pathway to getting done and in the second to last session we'll focus to how do I change the value of a company. So that's a structure of what's coming. In terms of pre-season prep, it's probably too late because the season's already begun. You should have three emails from me already, right? Starting today, you're probably going to get an email of accounting that you can make it through that raw data. Second, I have a statistics class. Why? Because what did I say in the biggest change in valuation? Huge amounts of data. We're drowning in data. And we need to figure out ways to take that data and make it manageable. That's what statistics should be about. That's unfortunately not how statistics classes get taught. So again, I have my own version of a statistics class on my website that you can take. It's 12 sessions. that for the next 15 weeks, I will take over your lives. I'll tell you how I'm going to take over. The week starts on Monday. You'll have class. And right after the class, like today's class, you'll get an email from me. You know, the email will contain what we did in the class, but I was just in the class. I know physically you were here, but there will be days where. But every week I put up a valuation of the week and I'll go all over the place. I think one of them is the valuation of the Los Angeles Clippers when Steve Armour bought it. So we're going to value companies. We're going to value businesses. And I'm going to remember, I said, I want to get you out of your comfort you can see what the typical value is what's high what's low on wednesday we will have another class obviously monday wednesday and on wednesday you will also get what's called a weekly challenge what's a weekly challenge every week we'll cover something That pain is coming. I'll describe it to you. But your project already, you might not realize this, but your project already started the minute you walked into class. And I'll talk about that project. And every Thursday is my nagging email. So where are you? Because I know exactly what you guys will do. Because the project is not due till May 8th. Many of you will not a class with 350 other people, it's easy to get lost and feel that nobody's noticed that. I'm going to try to catch you if you get lost. And these are all my devices to kind of keep you connected to the class. On Sunday, I'll send you the weekly challenge. Remember the one I sent you on Wednesday? I'll send you my solution. But again, it's not for grading. for falling behind so even if you're sick at home you should be able to watch the lectures if you're trapped in a foreign country don't ask me why you're a spy you've been arrested you've been thrown into a turkish jail ask for a wi-fi connection so you can watch the classes you don't you know you can bring if you can bring there's only one thing that you need for the lectures election or packet i sent you the link it home. So I'm not encouraging you to break through. Maybe I am, but if you do miss a class, catch up, there's no reason. Now, do you need a book? No, you can live without a book, but I do have five different books on valuation. You go to my website, I compare them, but basically let me face it, I'm not making money off these books in the first place. So do whatever you can if you need a book. But you're fine without a book. and something I talk about during the course of this class. So if it does come out, I'll let you know when it's available. Now there's more stuff. Almost everything for this class is on that page that's listed up there. So if you go to that link, that's the central clearing point for this class. Whether it's lecture notes, whether it's webcast, everything is centered there. So rather than go to Brightspace, that's where I would go for all the material for the class. chronicles. You know why I do this? Everything is about me. It's to protect myself because I know what you're going to say about a week, you know, six weeks from now. I'm going to say, remember that email? You say, what email? I didn't get it. No excuses here because every email that I sent will be the email chronicles you can go check out. So if you're blocking emails, unblock me at least for the next 15 weeks. After 15 weeks, I couldn't care less if you blocked me from that point on. my way of connecting. And if you still have time on your hands, I don't see how you would. There are more, if you want to read more stuff, there's a link again on my website, which will take you to more readings on each of the topics. Now, of course, the big question you have is, what's my grade going to be? So here's how I think about this, right? I'll have to come up with a device. If by the end of the class, you can value to get graded, there is going to be a valuation project, which I will start the next class talking about. But here's what I'd like you to start thinking about already. I want you to start thinking about a company you'd like to value and price over the course of the semester. And don't think about what would be an easy company to work with quizzes. Please read through the rules. Right. The rules are simple, which is if you're going to miss a quiz, you have to let me know before the quiz. Because I can't keep track of who's coming to say I can't give you the option, take the quiz and put it in your backpack. And if you do miss a quiz, the 10 percent gets moved to what's left in the class, not back, but always forward.",
