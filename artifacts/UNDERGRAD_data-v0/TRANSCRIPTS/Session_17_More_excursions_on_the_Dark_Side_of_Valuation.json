{"text": " well um Thank you. couple of reminders in case you need them first is if you want feedback on your valuation try to get it into me by friday friday six seven eight nine even saturday morning i'll tell you when i need to finish returning because that's all that matters to me what what does it mean for me is i need to return your dcfs back to you before monday because you know what we've run out of times now but if you have a first one and there are major issues and you want to fix and send back fine i don't odds are i don't even realize you're sending it back for a second time i'm just hitting and running moving down the rack so if you want to tell me you're sending it back for the second time i'll take a look at what you've changed so if you're doing it for a second time tell me what you changed so i can focus on what you've changed at least get back into that fixes the problem those of you who've received feedback But when you have a number in your valuation that looks weird, look inward because it's coming from one of your inputs. There are only really three inputs that drive your numbers. Forget about the cost of capital. That's really not where the dynamics are. It's your revenue growth, your margin, your sales to capital. Those are three numbers you give me. I didn't put them in there. I'm not forcing you to use the industry average. So don't use the industry average. I don't like this valuation because it's a choice you make. that room, which means the final, somebody's going to get a second shot. I can't help it. So, but it'll be in KMAC 260. And if you're in that section, please go there and the rest of you come here and there will be class after the quiz. Let me reemphasize, there will be class after the quiz. You might choose not to come, but I will be here. I will deliver the class. You can watch it on video if you don't feel like watching it right after the quiz, That's good management, right? Basically, there are things we describe for good management and bad management. But corporate governance is not about good or bad management. It's about, go ahead. It's about being able to change management. Boil it down to basics. You can talk about board of directors. You said, did you say control diversity? Risk, risk. Control risk, again, is a good, it's't complain, right? It's like being in Singapore. Lee Kuan Yew is effectively going to run the country, but I'm okay with that. He's benevolent dictators nobody worries about, but malevolent dictators not so much. It's a badly managed, badly run company. You do a discounted cash flow valuation, you value the company. And then you say, you know what? This company for bad corporate governance. In fact, if you have good corporate governance and you have a badly run company, what would you do differently in the company? It starts off with the same bad numbers, but if there's good corporate governance, what do you assume will happen over time? The management will get changed. When you move your numbers towards industry averages, as I know many of you are doing in your story, whether you like it or not, you're implicitly making assumptions that your company will change and move. But you decide to fix the company on your spreadsheet. You know how you fix a troubled company, a spreadsheet. You make small revenues into big revenues. You make the losses into profits. You bring your debt ratio down. Everything is easy to do on a spreadsheet. You make it a nice, healthy company. You give it a big terminal value. You discount it all back. Let's say you've been realistic and all these assumptions come up at the value. Vishen, will designed to capture operating risk. What kind of risk is this? Truncation risk. The risk that will not be in a year three is not a risk you can easily capture in a discount rate. So here's what's going to happen. Even if you're realistic about adjusting discount company. Don't tell me you're not because by Friday is supposed to turn in a company. So whether you want it or not, you're valuing a company. How many of you are using negative or expecting negative revenue growth at your companies? I know she is. She actually has zero revenue that she put negative revenue growth on. Talk about depressing outlook for the company. One person, you know what? to do because we're hardwired as human beings to be optimistic. And this seems like you're being unfair to the company. But it is reality and getting over that psychological barrier is what you need to do to get a value for a declining company. So my JCPenney valuation, this is my optimistic valuation of JCPenney. My optimistic valuation of J story. Eventually, I assume that there's a steady state for JCPenney where they will find stores where there are people who still want to come in, maybe in the Midwest and older people. Basically, there is a subset of the population. That might not be true. And we'll something I didn't know until I'd been working with valuation for a while. This is an implicit assumption rather than explicit one. Discounted cash flow valuations value companies as going concerns. So in discounted cash flow valuation, it's not that you assume a company will never have a bad year. It's you assume that you always bounce back from a bad year. You keep going. That's what allows you to keep the cash flows going. And for most healthy companies, counter it, which is what some people try to do. Deal with distress directly. What does that mean? Estimate a likelihood that your company will not be able to make it. And then ask yourself a follow-up question. If my company is not able to make it, what will I get as the equity investor in the company? You're saying, how the heck am I going to answer the first question? I'm going to give you three ways of estimating a likelihood that your company will not make it. We use bond prices to estimate the probability of failure. Let's face it. Equity investors are easily distracted. Shiny baubles. Look at growth. They're so excited about it. They don't look at the company. Bond investors, much as I don't like to hang out around them, are single-minded. What do bond investors care about? Will I get paid? Will I get paid? Will I get paid? What's the growth? I don't care. Will I get paid? Will I get paid? And you've got to give them credit for the focus. Sands. It's a casino company. I'm going to say something general about casino companies, and you might think it's unfair, but I think it's true if you look empirically at the statement. Casino companies tend to be run by megalomaniacs. Now, if you don't believe me, take a look at the biggest casino companies. Wind Resorts, Steve Wind. Las Vegas Sands was run by a guy called Sheldon Adams. He owned 52% of the company, You guys ever stayed at the Bellagio? I've been lost in that place more often than I want to be. There are 28 restaurants just in the Bellagio. Think about it, 28 restaurants. I mean, you walk in the wrong direction, the Bellagio, you can be a half a mile away from where you need to be. But each of these casinos cost hundreds of millions of dollars, which you need to raise capital. What are the two ways you can raise capital nobody wanted to fly to Vegas to gamble. They didn't have money. The second was all that debt that had been accumulated that nobody had noticed over the previous seven years. People woke up and said, you have a lot of debt, as if it suddenly showed up like manna from heaven, 15 billion. This was a valuation I did of Las Vegas Sands in February of 2009. And I set the stage. None of these are unrealistic or implausible assumptions. If Las Vegas Sands recovers, this is exactly what will happen. That leads me to a high terminal value. Take the present value. The value per share that I got for Las Vegas Sands was $8.12 per share. The stock was at $4.25. So ask me the question. You know the question I told you you should ask. Anytime somebody does a valuation, what's the question? Am I buying? that Las Vegas Sands will not make it. So I'll give you a couple of ways of doing it. The simplistic way, the easy way, and this is the way I'd suggest most of you follow, is Las Vegas Sands had a bond rating. Its bond rating was B+. You can see the ratings agencies were already getting scared about the future. A B-plus rated bond, at least in 2009, the likelihood of default on the bond over the following 10 years is 28%. So if I follow that approach, Why? Because people are scared they won't get the cash back. Now, the way we normally price bonds is we take the promised coupons and face value and discount them back at this default risk adjusted rate. I'm not going to do that. Instead, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to take the promised coupon. 63.75 is the coupon every year. That's 6.375%. But to get that coupon, what has to even mean? Given how the bonds were priced, there's a 13.5% chance each year that the bond will not make it through the end of the year. You say, that's not very much. That's in one year. How long do I have to live to see nirvana? I have to get to year 10. So I have to survive year one, year two, year three. So basically think of an 86% chance of zero thank god for limited liability otherwise they'll be coming after the rest of your work right so here's what i have every eight dollars and 12 cents is my value if the company makes it but there's only a 23 chance and zero as my value the company doesn't make it there's a 77 chance my expected value's just a ratings agency. And we know ratings agencies are late to the party, right? So when a company gets into trouble, they're often chasing, they're often three to six months behind. So if you feel the bond market is too volatile, you might go with the ratings approach. But with distressed companies, sometimes it will lag what's actually happening in the market. Yes. The assumption that that property stays the same is probably unrealistic because failure rates are probably higher early on. Now move on to emerging market companies. Now I have to be quite clear, much of what I say about emerging market companies is not exclusive to emerging market companies. I don't mean to pick on them, but you're more likely to run into them with emerging market companies. So let's go through the four questions. What are your cash flows from existing assets? today we actually are more convergent you don't realize it because you don't have the benefit of looking across time but when you complain about a chinese company's accounting and you say they're probably doing some shady things they used to do far more shady things probably 10 years ago you're moving in the right direction but there's only so much you can do but that's the to the degree that these numbers are opaque and they're holding back And my recommendation with country risk is something that's an extension of what we did in the context of discussing country risk. After I estimated the country risk premiums for every country, I said, don't use a bludgeon. Don't take every company in a country and attach a country risk premium to it. Look at where it gets its revenues and adjust for operations are. Second, and this is something that I run into all the time with emerging market analysts, which is what do we do about currency risk? So let's first step back. When we talk about currency risk, you've got to be very clear that you're not talking about expected devaluation in aly how much will it devalue each year? About 7%? The difference between the two inflation rates? So when people say, are you dealing with that? In a cash flow, you're already bringing an expected devaluation. So if that's your concern, that you have a currency that will devalue, I should already be building into your cash flows. But it's true that that actual devaluation might be different from the expected devaluation. countries, different currencies. Currency risk is one of those classic risks that in a global portfolio would start to average out because it can cut in both directions. If your investors are not global, then maybe you can adjust for currency risk and bring in an additional premium because there's additional uncertainty. But for the most part, let currency risk go. It shouldn't be affecting your discount rates because investors can diversify a much lower discount rate, cost of capital in US dollars than in rupees. If I change nothing else, lower discount rates should make my value higher, right? But I'm not quite done. When I did my growth rates, when I did my rupee valuation, those growth rates are rupee growth rates. What does that mean? Those growth rates reflect the higher inflation in the company right now and you're trying to do everything in turkish lira russian rubles or egyptian pounds you're probably driving yourself because everything cancels out. Any questions on currencies? Let's talk about corporate governance. As I said, this focus on corporate governance in finance started with a paper written by Michael Jensen and William Meckling. This was 1974. But for the first time, they said, what managers do is not always in the best interest. It was stating the obvious, or does have little or no power to change the way management makes decisions. This is a problem around the world, but it's more so a problem in emerging markets because of the history. A lot of these emerging markets used to have family group companies that were privately run, that are publicly traded. And because of the structure, the pyramids in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia and the holding structures, the family group holding structures, in India, it's very difficult to change the way companies run. He said, can you come in and talk to our top management? And I couldn't say no, because I've known this person since I was very young. So I said, OK. And I said, what do you want to talk about? He said, we think our stock is massively underpriced. It's trading at 101 rupees per share, which is like four times earnings or five times earnings. I said, OK. And I said, I can't make any promises that I'll confirm your biases. I'll come in and do a valuation. And he said, I don't understand why it's 101 rupees. We're growing fast as a company. far more. I said, wait a moment, because you're going to see if this is actually helping you or hurting you. So I used to 60% reinvestment rate. They were reinvesting a lot, but the return on capital they were earning as a company was about 9.2%. Now, that doesn't sound bad, right? If you think in US dollar terms in 2022, but this was in Indian rupee terms in 2004 or 2005. And the risk-free rate then in Indian rupees was going to converge on cost of capital in terminal value, you know, even though you're destroying value and that'll give them a terminal value that reflects at least zero value destruction beyond. I didn't do that here. You know why? Because the management didn't think there was a problem. They thought we're growing. Why are they being, you know what, the market's probably being too generous to you. It should probably be pricing you at 62 rupees. So I asked for suggestions because this was the entire top management group. What do you think I'm missing here? And most of them said, well, you're missing the fact that we're reinvesting more. You should use a higher reinvestment rate. So I went along and I used 100 percent reinvestment rate. You push it up to 16%. It goes up to 150 rupees. You're saying, what if we can't find projects that make 16%? I think I said, that's easy. Stop reinvesting because nobody forces you to reinvest. If you have a zero reinvestment rate here, you get 150 rupees per share. Send all your project managers home. Stop looking for projects. You will be better off. managers might be in too much denial to even make that fix. Any questions? Sorry. Fourth issue, and this is an issue that we ran into when we talked about loose sense. I said the most difficult scenarios in valuation is a company with lots of crossholdings. Because those crossholdings are opaque, they're difficult to value. So you're left holding this bag of, the Tata Group. It's one of India's oldest family groups. It's been around 150 years. Well-regarded group. I took four Tata companies and I'm going to cut to the chase. I valued all four. See the blue parts in this graph are my intrinsic valuations for each company. What is that? Free cash for the firm, cost of capital, all these companies get these crossholdings in the first place? It's a lot younger. Finish the thought. Here's how these companies ended up with these crossholdings. They didn't actually invest in each other, but it does mean that we're investing in family group companies, that the younger companies in the group are going to be easier to value than the older companies precisely for this reason, the crossholding problem. It doesn't quite go away, but it's much smaller. Which brings me to the final issue. We talked about truncation risk in the case of distressed companies. There, the truncation risk is if I don't make my debt payment, life ends for me be a hurricane. You could effectively wipe out our old business. He said, why don't they insure themselves? You know how much it'll cost you if you're an Antiguan company to go out and buy insurance against a hurricane? That's a truncation risk. I have a great hotel business right on the beach, but tomorrow it could be part of the ocean, and there goes my hotel business, right? He said, but people are noticing. And I said, that's very good, right? And he said, some people who are noticing are in the government. And then I knew where this discussion was going. He said, look, we're worried that we might be nationalized. How do I bring that into my valuation? You can't bring that into your cash flows, your discount rate. So I said, do the same of the valuations of the week in case you got to it you're probably going to listen to something you read in my post you didn't get to it but now you're going to hear it for the first time 2019 aramco announces. He's saying, why? How much are you going to pay for the Saudi sands? Not much, right? After the oil is gone, there's nothing there. So it's 50 years of cash flows. I did it with the dividend discount model but they basically all gave me values of about 1.7, maybe 1.75 trillion dollars. A lot of value from having 300 million barrels of oil on which the cost of extraction is three to four dollars the risk in Aramco completely, because the risk you're concerned about here is you're not buying a company. You're buying a country. 80% of Saudi Arabia's GDP comes from oil, and Aramco is the instrument that delivers that oil. So you're basically buying a piece of Saudi Arabia. And you're not just buying a piece of Saudi Arabia, you're buying a piece of the Saudi royal family, because for better or worse, there is that implicit assumption that this country is about Middle Eastern politics. You're talking about 50 years, right? I'm going to assume there's at least a 20% chance that something will happen, a regime change will happen in Saudi Arabia over the next 50 years. Maybe I'm overestimating it. Maybe I'm underestimating. And then I had to ask and say the follow-up question. If there's a regime change, what will happen to my value? Now, if ISIS takes over, then I know exactly what's going to happen to my value. But let's assume it's an intermediate regime. And that expected value then tries at least to factor in political risk. Now, earlier this year, if you remember, there's the Adani group getting it. One of the strengths for the Adani group is, what's one of its biggest strengths? Connections, right? Connections to the government and an infrastructure business that can work in your favor. Could that work against you? search handles. You might not have, but new value complex, the dirty group, what choice do you have? I remember valuing EasyJet in 2019. You guys know what EasyJet does? It's a UK-based discount airline that flies middle-class Britishers to Spain and Greece in the winter. The basic business model is flying vacationers out of the UK into sunnier parts of Europe. expensive endeavor. So when I valued EasyJet in 2019, I valued it three times. Once with hard Brexit, which means the UK walks away, no agreements in place, soft Brexit, or no Brexit, maybe they'd back away from the ledge. We didn't know in 2019. I got three different values. Of course, I still had the responsibility of estimating the likelihood of each of those and taking an expected value. But what I'm trying to take you is on a journey of how bank valuation has or should have evolved over time and why banks used to be easy to value them and the models we used and why we might need to abandon those models. So let's start by looking at the questions that you need to answer to value any company and apply Nothing is working capital. So for the longest time with banks, here's what we end up with. You throw up your hands and you say, I don't know what the cash flow is. And you know what you do then, right? If you cannot estimate cash flow to equity because you can't get those intermediate items, you look at dividends. And what are you doing? You're assuming that banks pay out what they can afford to do. This is why I assume, I said you have to assume that banks are run by sensible people, that they're paying out what they can afford to pay. now do you see why the dividend discount model this was the last bastion for the dividend discount model banks used to be valued the dividend discount model and when we did that whether we liked it or not we were making those two assumptions with banks i describe your the what you go through as entering into a faustian bargain the faustian bargain is banks are opaque you don't know much about what's happening behind the surface but you're okay with it It's a pretty big Egyptian bank, well regarded. And I wanted to value something in Egyptian pounds. I'd never valued a company in Egyptian pounds. And I felt that it was a big part, an empty part of my life. I had to fill it by valuing the bank. So I'm going to take you through the process of valuing CIB. If I'm doing my valuation in Egyptian pounds, I need a risk-free rate in Egyptian pounds. And remember this, you know, when we did risk-free rates, I talked about there was no government bond rate in Egyptian pounds. whatever they want and get away with it. They have a huge return equity. And given that they were reinvesting at a retention rate of 75%, their growth rate is 32%. So this is a high growth bank with a high cost of equity and a low payout ratio. Normally not ingredients that you would think go into dividend discount more. But here's why it works. When I start the process, their payout ratio is only 25%. They have a high growth rate and a high cost of equity. valuation following the same principles. As growth gets lower, I'm reinvesting less. As I reinvest less, there's more dividends to pay out. So my dividends actually grow at a rate much faster than my earnings, and I discount them back at 23%. The value per share that I get, this is 40. There's nothing, no need to add cash, no need to subtract our debt. Now you can see why people like the dividend discount model? So here's the first thing I want to emphasize with banks and something I've kind of talked around. The first is that, by definition, banks are opaque. They're difficult to understand. I mean, you'd see in hindsight, people look at Silicon Valley Bank and say, I knew it was coming. because to be quite honest, who cares what the book value of equity is at a Microsoft or an Apple or any other company or any non-financial service company? You know that one in nine US companies now has negative book value of equity. That'll freak accountants out. But frankly, I don't care. You know how you end up with negative book value of equity? You start with a positive number and then you slide. You lose money. You keep losingities. So with a bank, I actually have to keep my eye on book equity. And to the extent that I need to, that I fall short, I've got to bring in fresh equity to increase my regularity. That's what SVB was trying to do, and it triggered the panic, right? And that gave me an opening to think about said, I need to come up with a measure of what a bank can actually pay out, a free cash load equity. We do this with regular companies. But the traditional way of working to free cash load equity is not going to get me there because I can't get capex. I can't get depreciation. So I rethought what reinvestment in a bank has. And here's the way I thought through it. And you tell me whether there's a flaw in my reason. For a bank to survive, it's got to meet the regulatory capital requirements. is net income minus that reinvestment in regulatory capital. I have now escaped from the tyranny of the dividend-discount model. I'm no longer dependent on the bank telling me what it can pay out. I can estimate my free cash redacted. So I'm going to try. The bank that I picked is one of the two banks that I describe as characters in a horror movie. You've seen horror movies? Usually there's a teenage. I know it's very sexy. Every year they go down to the basement. Blood, gore, they come back out, they go back down again and again and again. Credit suites at least, the pain is over. But Deutsche, the pain continues. Limbs are gone, but they're still going down. So this was evaluation I did of Deutsche in October of 2016. And it was not a good time. So here do I know that's high or low? You know, that number, you can get it from Capital IQ, you can get that for every bank. So I actually pulled that for every bank to see where they fell. They fell in like the 10th percentile. That tier one capital ratio had become way too low. And given their risk as this bank with investment banking and risky arms, they should really be around at about a 15.67%. They're income. Next, I said they've got to get the regulatory capital ratio fixed and they've got to do it soon because there was talk in 2016 of Deutsche being taken effectively into receivership. What does that mean? You'd never liquidate a bank. It doesn't make sense. You have all these depositors. You find somebody else to essentially take it over. in regulatory capital each year. If you take the change from where they are now, they have to invest about $6.6 billion in regulatory capital next year. Let me take you on one. They have a big loss. They've got to come up with $6.6 billion in regulatory capital. You add the numbers up, their free cash flow to equity is minus $11.7 billion. You think, what does that mean? Based on my projections, Deutsche will have to have raised $11.7 in new equity next year. In fact, 10% chance because this was a good time. Most banks were healthy, but if you're in an environment where banks are getting into trouble, this is the number that's going to jump up because a bank that looks healthy, where there's a 30% chance of getting into debt spiral, it's going to be worth less than a bank without that. It has a 10% chance. I assume zero value for my equity if that happened. My expected value per share was 2067. Stock price is 1333. Ask me the question.
