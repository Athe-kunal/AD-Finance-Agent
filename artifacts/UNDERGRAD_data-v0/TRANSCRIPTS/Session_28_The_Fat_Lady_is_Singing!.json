Folks if you, if you haven't in your group then you better catch up with them because they won't be on that list so the sequencing of the grading of the projects i would start with my valuation class because they're graduating second year mbas they need the grades in so i'm going to start with So what I'm going to do today actually is use your project as kind of a launching pad to kind of talk about the entire class. So remember at the start of the 10 companies that you were looking at, you also had a chance to apply an option pricing model. What's a great thing about applying an option pricing model? It allows you to attach a premium on your DCF value and everybody likes to pay premiums. So very quick summary. What's intrinsic valuation all about? It's about answering four basic questions or doing nothing with growth, is the good side of growth is it pushes up your earnings and your revenues. The bad side of growth is you got to reinvest to get that growth. The net effect is what drives that growth. Third question I had was how risky is your company? Notice I didn't ask you what's your beta, which I mean, don't mistake tools for end games. You don't like betas, I don't care. Use something else to replace it, but you still need a risk adjusted discount rate that reflects the risk is always there. And if you look at my model, the drivers of value are five inputs. Basically, your revenue growth capturing the growth part of the model. Your profitability captured with the target operating margin. So except the fact that you might not be making money now. A sales to capital ratio capturing how efficiently you grow. So how much are you growing? How profitable are you? and ultimately when you look at your valuation all you can do is check for consistency what does consistency mean this is what i call my valuation triangle it has three sides to it growth your margins and your reinvestment and in other words risk also plays in and the efficiency and consistency means that if you're going to be fighting on margins, right? Because you're cutting prices. So when you tell me a story of a company that's growing faster and delivering higher margins, the question is, what is special about the company? What is going to allow it to do it? Maybe it's in a market that's changing and it's taking advantage of it, or about your companies first did i let you pick your own companies that was a pain in the neck right you'd rather that i would assign you companies think of how many weeks you played hamlet so did it about this company? Right. Canadians, the only Canadian company you can think of. Maybe that's it. You know, I want to do something for Canada. I pick Lululemon. It shows up on that list. Man U, six of you valued Man U. Extraordinarily interesting company to value. I'm going to talk about the value to price divide there, which I don't think will ever close. And we'll talk about why with professional sports teams, one of these days. It's the only way you can bring in Ferrari into the picture. Quite a few Ferrari valuations in there. And Peloton, maybe you're thinking about maybe I should be exercising instead of watching Netflix and Peloton showed up in the list as well. Now, I'm often asked why I allow people to value the same company, right? There's a simple reason. You value the same company. You think you're going to come up had 12 people value Tesla. And you should see the divergence in values on Tesla. 12 people value Coca-Cola, there's going to be almost no divergence in that. And think of why. Again, it's a story, right? And if you look at a young company, the kind of stories you can tell about Tesla can drain the spectrum the values are going to reflect. So when you see the same company being valued, you might, in fact, There have been times again where a dozen people value a company, there are 10 buys and two sells, because people can make different recommendations. So you want to see what you found? These were your undervalued and overvalued stocks. I'm comparing your DC value to the price. There were 103 undervalued companies and 210 overvalued companies. Why do you think that is? I did look at your most under, so I took your companies and this is the list of companies that I think the 15 or 20 most undervalued companies. If your company's on the list, you can tell me the story if you want to, but basically I've looked at the percentage change between the price and the value. Tencent was the most undervalued stock. Actually, I own Tencent. Okay, first, can that happen? Isha, you had a DC value of zero for your company, right? Or did you change? Or you pushed it above zero because you didn't like zero? Okay. Can a business, the equity in a business be worth nothing? I call this the movie pass-through. Remember movie pass, the company? One of those incredibly stupid business ideas ever concocted. And he describes the basis for his idea. He says the average American goes to one movie a year. The average American, the ticket in their movies costs, there must be a lot of cheap tickets in the Midwest somewhere. Average ticket costs $8. We make money on the average. What's the problem with that logic? It's not the average American who's buying movie pass. It's people like my son who watches one movie every day. I mean, he works at Disney. emails that I've exchanged with them. How do I get my value above zero? And finally, your response is, stop trying. You've hit a brick wall. Many of them have debt, right? AMC shows up twice. AMC, I mean, I know, value AMC, the problem you run into is the theater business is under assault. These companies have a lot of debt. So the zero value is not that irrational. You can have companies with the equities worth zero, consider whether they should stay in your portfolio. I'm not making any investment recommendations. Now, this is my 37th semester teaching this class, and I've kept track of buy and sell recommendations that come out of the class. And this is as much a test of me as it's a test of you as to whether your buy recommendations and sell recommendations make money. So clearly it's not 100 and 0. My recommendations were better. But you should expect that, right? I'm glad it's not 50-50. Because that would be true randomness and this entire class would be an exercise in how much time can you waste delivering randomness. And I hope that's not the end. The excess returns that I've computed are also broke down by kinds of companies. It's greater on small cap and emerging market companies than it is on developed market companies. And that again You know, and he talks, he asked Charlie Munger, are you too worried that Apple has become such a big part of your portfolio? And then he throws my name in about concentration. That's a good spot. My name came up. The bad part is Charlie Munger said I was out of my mind. So I've been checking into some lunatic asylums over the weekend saying, can I check in? I'm out of my mind. But this is a debate worth having. How much concentration should you have? was one of the buys from this class. It would have been an insanely good buy. So every time you look at these portfolios and you look at their overall returns, a lot of it comes from letting the winners essentially deliver the returns. And finally, stocks that are both undervalued and underpriced did better than stocks with this just undervalued. Remember I asked you to value your company and price your company? Companies where you get the double whammy, where both come in as undervalued, historically have done better. would you invest? You think, doesn't the first post already answer the question? What does the first post ask? What makes for a good bank? What makes for a bad bank? What's the second post about? What makes for a good investment in a bank? Are good banks good investments? Not necessarily, right? Because what does it depend on? What price you pay. So in the second post, I looked at, given that there's a pricing for these banks, if you were to pick a bank bank, right? You think, why would you invest in a stodgy, badly run bank? Because it's priced as a stodgy, abysmally run bank. It trades at half of book value. One of the lowest price. It is, in fact, by far the lowest price to book ratio of any of the top money funders. So I valued the bank, but I also priced Citi. What does that mean? I compared Citi to the my last class. In the last class, we talked about changing value to company. What are the four places you can go? You can increase cash flows to existing assets, try to get more value from growth, lengthen your growth period, lower your cost of capital, right? So if you take a company, in fact, you can take your DCF and say, if somebody else ran my company, what would the value be? That difference is the value of control, the change in value that you can get from you running the company rights, your access to funds, right? You need to take over a company. So the questions I'm going to ask to determine whether change can come will depend on the company. So over time, when you think about control changing in companies, you think about what causes that change. The first is corporate governance laws do affect change. Within the US, the SEC makes things more difficult, less difficult to everybody in that sector. Saying, wake up, it could happen to you. So when you think about likelihood of change, that likelihood can shift over time. And over the last 20 or 30 years, there's been a fair amount of research make sense. Boards often, remember, shareholders don't vote on CEOs. The board is the one that actually moves CEOs in and out. The structure of the board matters. Research seems to indicate that ownership structure in your stock matters. Companies with a lot of institutional investors are more likely to see change than stocks where companies with a lot of individual investors. Part of it is just, it's easier to get a coalition going when you have institutional investors I'm sorry, Jake? It's not friendly, but friendly to who? It's actually very friendly to shareholders in the target company. It's not friendly to the managers in the target company. What's share count i let you figure all those things out because you have until 5 p.m to do it or maybe a little later if you want to withdraw it and send it back you value voting and non-voting shares there's an issue right because how do we get the value per share we get made that pre. And finally, I want to talk about what I call the minority discount. Let's say I own a private business and you come to me and you want to buy a slice of my business. And I give you two choices. You can get 49% of my business or 51% of my business. This is really 2% difference, right? You know that the 49% of my business, I came up with $12.47. Blockbuster was actually trading at $9.50 in July 2005. So let's say you trust my valuation would change, $12.47. So what does that tell you? If you buy Blockbuster at $9.50, it could be worth up to $12.47 if you can make those changes. So let's say you trust my valuation. Would you be willing to pay the $2.97 as a premium to buy a company in a hostile acquisition because you value control and you value the control, then you want to at least get some share of it for yourself. You'd like to keep 100% for yourself, but that's not going to happen. But you'd like to keep 50%, 30%. That's the first place, value control. Second, I said, even if your company is not the target of an acquisition, the value of control plays out in the background. Let's go back to Blockbuster. There's only a 42% change. Now do you see why when you own a stock, a Bill Ackman or a Carl Icahn showing up in your stock is going to cause a jump in your stock price. It's not that your value went up, but the likelihood of change went up when it happened. So if I remove that likelihood of change, you know what Blockbuster is going to trade at? It's going to go back to $5. So I valued Embraer twice. The status quo value is 12.5 billion. The optimal value is 14.7. So by changing the company, I can get a $2.2 billion increase in value. what do i gain by doing by gaining getting a voting share i get a chance to change management just a chance not a guarantee there's a 20 chance that i can change management so that's my expected likelihood of the value control divided by just the voting shares i get a value per share of 19 dollars and 19 cents i'm not willing to pay an extra dollar 81 why because i think there is If my hypothesis is right, six, seven years ago, when people thought of Mark Zuckerberg as a management genius, the two should trade at roughly the same price. Last year, at the very bottom, when nobody trusted Zuckerberg, you should have seen the difference. Why? I haven't checked it out, but you might want to check on Bloomberg what that difference in price, because of what trade you can see what that premium and discount is. two DCF values, you'd have effectively what I have for blockbuster number R. It's a good exercise in valuation is to look at those levers and see how they drive around. Finally, let's talk about minority discounts. Let's suppose I have a company and I valued it twice. It's a private business. 1.6 million is the value with existing management, me, running it. 2 million is the value with somebody much more efficient Because who would be running the Mets still? Be the Wilpons. Think of the value of the Mets with the Wilpons running them. And you say, this is going to converge on zero. It's like the Dolans running Madison Square Garden. When will these guys push the value to zero? The less you think about the existing management, the more of a minority discount you're going to attach because you're stuck. So this value of control is actually going to play out in multiple places in valuation. revenue growth margins it's too many already you know i've got the things to drive a meeting to go to can you put on one metric so i can focus on so consulting firms have discovered that if they can give them one magical metric that ceos will buy it that magical metric often has you know as an acronym why acronyms always have this air an air of mystery to them i don't know what's the many people actually use acronyms without actually knowing what the acronym stands for but often companies. The first was this notion called economic value added or EVA. In fact, I'm supposed to put a trademark right next to that with a little R on it because this was trademarked by a company called Stern Stewart that claimed to have invented it. It's an amazingly deep concept. I'll describe what it is and you tell me how deep it is. It takes a difference between return on capital and cost of capital. And it says it a return on invested capital in your company, right? It's based on operating income and book value capital. And of course you're saying income is not cash flow. So cash flow return on investment first replaces operating income discounted cash flow valuation, which is absurd. You know what EVA does? In a traditional DCF valuation, we take free cash to the firm and discount back at the cost of capital, right? What EVA does is it takes a free cash to the firm and it breaks it up into two pieces, a free cash flow up to the cost of capital and a free cash flow in excess, and it discounts the two pieces separately. You absurd, then you charge the outrageous. That's a history of consulting and, in fact, they played it up. Stern Stewart was founded by two men, Joel Stern and Bennett Stewart, and Bennett Stewart was an incredible salesman. He could sell refrigerators to Eskimos. He could do it, you know, he could sell it to people who didn't need it. And he sold EVA, you'll be just like Coca-Cola. Pissed me off to no end. So I bided my time. And about two years later, I was back on a panel with Bennett. And this time I came prepared. I knew exactly what his prop was going to be. Coca-Cola annual report. See, he does the Coca-Cola annual report. Coca-Cola is, you know, do you want to be like Coca-Cola? Coca-Cola uses EVA. You should use EVA too world and wear all of the tennis. I'm not going to slam dunk a basketball. Michael Jordan didn't become Michael Jordan because he was wearing Air Jordans. But that's the message you get. And he said, you know, do you want Coca-Cola didn't become a great company in the 80s and 90s because they used TVA. It's because they did things right. of tests and is it uniformly estimated? Second stop, don't let people give you rules of thumb. This is not 1965. We have the data. Take a look at the entire data. Do a histogram. What's high? What's low? Play some money ball. Third stop, you're not running away from making the assumptions you need to make in to pick a multiple, right? Some of you tried six. I know one person who tried 14 different multiples. They were getting really creative at some point at what they put in the denominator. It was a search for a higher R squared, right? We'll talk about where that search can lead you. But here's what you ended up using. 58% of you used EV to sales. Why? In fact, I'll wager that if you focus in on the price to book, a few of them are financial service companies. You had no choice but to use an equity multiple there to make the judgment. That is a statistic that I've tracked over time. 20 years ago, if you looked at this pie chart, more than 50% were equity multiples, price earnings, price to book. Over time, we've increasingly moved away. As leverage has started shifting across sectors, you see the shift towards enterprise value. Here's what you found your companies to be underpriced, 179 overpriced. Little better. It's not 50-50, but you can see it's a little better. So your pricing pushed you to a different conclusion than your DCF valuation. And that's natural. So here's what you're pricing, most underpriced stocks. So basically, I took your price per share, your DCF, but basically, you're comparing the pricing to the price per share. you can see your most underpriced stocks and there are cells that stand out. When you look at the most overpriced again, they're all cells, at least thank God for that. So your most overpriced stock, don't tell any Elon Musk fans this, is Tesla. And I'm willing to debate the pricing, but that $8.65 suggests to me that you probably picked the option. The exclusivity is when you have any option, right? For equity to be a liquidation option, it had to first be... It had to be a money losing company with... What's the other condition? A lot of debt. Without the debt, the equity... This is the option liquidate. We're not talking about the option to expand because those options, getting the inputs is really messy. into $3 per share. So there were, I think, I think there were more than eight, but when I was counting, there were eight companies where I counted up front, where the premium we were getting on average over DCF value was about 41%. That's why the option pricing moment. And then I asked you to make a recommendation. God, this created a lot of angst among you. Should I buy? Should I sell? What should I do? Can I say hold? I mean, I got like 50 emails. Is it okay if I say hold? done, right? But basically, you're always going to have uncertainty. Second is, let's face it, whether you like it or not, we're all believers in efficient markets. Sounds like a strange thing to say. In what way? When you buy something undervalued, what has to happen for you to actually make money? The price. We're all believers in efficient markets. The only question is, when will markets become efficient? We have a very convenient definition of market act because if you're going to put 30 or 40 percent of your money in a particular company you're going to paralyze yourself with what if questions and what if something goes wrong because all you need is something to go wrong and there goes a third of your portfolio that would be my argument against charlie munger leaving 40 percent in apple i own apple but i my apple holding is seven percent of my portfolio i think it's a good company i'm not disagreeing You want to see what that statistic has looked like over time? Take a look at the brown line. That's the buy to sell. So when that number is one, there are as many buys as sells. So go back to 1999, there were as many buys as sells. Pretty much parity. Two years later, that's the highest number we've ever got. Buys outnumbered sells by almost 1.4. Spring 2001, what was happening? Did I mention at the start of the class that I will be buying one of the stocks on your undervalued list? You know what my condition is, right, to buy? You're going to get an email from me asking, are you really buying? Not the buy that you wrote in. And if you say no or I'm not sure yet, I'm not buying either. So I'm willing to go on this bet with you. You say buy and you're actually putting your money in it that I should come along for the ride. Now, in terms of that choice between value and price, which is better? One is it depends on what your value, right? So if I give you an asset which doesn't have cash flow, for God's sakes, don't even try to value it. What am I talking about? If I ask you what's the value of gold, your response is gold cannot be valued. It's not a cash flow generating asset. If I ask you what's the value of Bitcoin, don't even go there. why because that's what you're supposed to say but you know what it's not often your choice you were born impatient your time horizon might be 15 minutes why are you fighting it in fact if i were at berkshire hathaway let's face it charlie munger's time horizon is pretty short right now right and i don't want to be morbid and you're 97 years old you're not mapping out things over two days maybe that's why he's okay with apple being 40 of its portfolio to earn a paycheck. It's a very different game. So keep your managing director happy. That's your end game. It's not about delivering the right value. You can see how already biases start to enter in the process when you're valuing for other people. And finally, what you believe about markets is going to drive whether you go with value or price. When you do intrinsic valuation, you assume that markets make mistakes across time and they correct them over time. is valuing your company and pricing your company. They ask you, how many of you would pick discounted cash flow valuation and intrinsic value? How many of you would go with intrinsic valuation? Put up your hands. How many of you would go with pricing because you found it much cleaner? How many of you at this point have decided that the best thing to do with your life is not even try to do it? It's actually a very healthy recognition, right? It's actually the healthiest conclusion that 90% of people can take. So if you got there, just take it as the biggest lesson you got. I would like half of all those brokerage fees you'd have spent, if you could mail those to me as thank you for saving me that much money, I'd be glad to take it. And remember at the start of the class, I said, are you a storyteller. Some of you came into this class as natural number crunchers. And here my task was more difficult, right? What was my task is to make you trust your own imagination. God, this was a tough thing to do, right? Because you wanted confirmation your entire life was dot the I's, cross the T's. Your inner accountant kept speaking up saying, this is so subjective. That word comes up more I hear about this time is different, the more I realize this time is not. Fundamentals always matter. The basics of business don't change. You can put a dot-com at the end. You can put an AI in the front. It doesn't make a difference. A business ultimately has to generate cash flows. The risk in those cash flows matter and value is driven by the time. Second, I don't know whether you noticed it, but there were things you got stuck on in the Learning what to focus on and what to let go is a big part of valuation. So understanding the big picture is critical. Third, how many of you are graduating? So you're going to go to work there and this grizzled veteran is going to show up and say, oh, my gut tells me eight times EBITDA is cheap. My gut tells me that what you're doing doesn't make sense. Stop trusting people's guts. major from Yale would come back for the business school because history majors don't get paid very much. And if you're a history major from Yale who comes back for an MBA, you take what I call the strategic route. You can now add the word sustainable to that route as well. What do you do? You pick classes with the word sustainable or strategic in the name. You can go through two years of an MBA without ever seeing a choice between being lucky and knowing everything there is no valuation which one should you pick justcomm? I knew the minute I asked this question, I shouldn't have because she told me, she said she bought Qualcomm because it owned MCI. I said, that's not Qualcomm, that's WorldCom. She says, Qualcomm, WorldCom, what's the difference? I said, you pick the wrong company. And after she left, I did try a strategy, pick a company in the news, pick one that rhymes with it. You know what, if it had worked, forget this cashflow stuff, it would have been the rhyming stock strategy that I've tried.",
