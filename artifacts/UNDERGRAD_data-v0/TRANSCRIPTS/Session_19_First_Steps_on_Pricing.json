{"text": " um hi So, I'm not the Pope. I'm not infallible. I screw up on my grading. And it's in your best interest to check to see that, especially those quizzes I graded around 11.45 at night. God only knows what I was even on at that point in time. No, they're always even awake, half asleep. So if I messed up, here's all you need to do. Don't make up elaborate emails on what you did. Take a picture of the page where you see described as valuation is really pricey. People like to do pricing for whatever reason. And one of the reasons that many analysts give for why they like to use PE ratios and comparables and not use a discounted cash flow model is they say, look, you make a lot of assumptions when you do a discounted cash flow valuation, do you? cash flows, growth, and risk. You are making exactly the same assumptions you did in your DCF, but you're making them implicit. You're saying, so what? Let's say you're making an implicit assumption of 80% growth in your revenues over time. Wouldn't you want to test that assumption, at least with an intrinsic valuation? When you make up a really crazy number, you know you've made it up. You worry about it. With pricing, you don't need statistics because it's all pointing in the same direction. It's because you have large and contradictory data, statistics helps you make increases. Do you have large and contradictory data in markets? because you say, you know, I'm normal. I'll pick the normal distribution, whatever the reasoning is. And what's the nice thing about the normal distribution? Why do we so love the normal distribution? What is it about the normal distribution that makes it so easy to work with? It can be described with two parameters. What are the two parameters? The mean and the standard deviation. When I go to complicated distributions, I need four parameters, five parameters. So it's nice to work with normal distributions. zero why because when earnings turn negative the p ratio becomes not meaningful and not available so the lowest value you can get is zero what's the highest value p ratio you can take you don't see infinity but it can be really high you know what the highest p ratio among u.s stocks was started 2023 86 400 i think that must be one highly priced stock right So all your outliers are big positive numbers. There's nothing to offset on the other side. Now do you see why we should care about statistics? How many times do you and analysts get on CNBC and say, this stock is cheap, complete the story, because it's trading at a P ratio less than the average for the sector. If that anchor had a brain that might be asking for too much, you know what you should have asked the analyst right away, right? What's immediate? You know what most analysts say? What's immediate? sell you a stock and i'm selling it on a very simple story the p ratio for the stock the software company is 12 and the median p let's replace the average the median the median p for the sector is 20 it's trading at well below the median and i'm saying it's cheap play devil's advocate ask me the questions but you know what why you're asking questions you want to see whether it's in fact cheap or whether it deserves to be cheap because there's something holding it back so over its head. There's some issues with the company. It's a high-risk company. So it could be low growth. It could be high risk. Let's complete the cycle. Is all growth created equal? We talked about value creating growth and value destroying growth. And in the context of equity, what's a metric we look at to make that judgment on whether growth is good or bad? It's an accounting ratio. Return on equity or high return on equity? You want high? You think, what chance do I have finding something like this? No harm looking, right? I don't know how many of you have accessed Capital IQ. Capital IQ, you can screen any market you want. So here's your first screen. You say, find me every stock with a P ratio less than 15. You'll get thousands. Second screen. think of how that's the screening process so one of the things i want to go through is with p i said it's growth and earnings it's risk and equity usually and it's return equity i want to come up with the same kind of mechanism with other multiples eb to sales and eb to habitat because if you can do that you can do pricing well so let's do a first stop. The value process delivers value. The pricing process delivers price. Could the two be different? Yeah, there's a gap. Let's say you're a value extremist. You say, who's a value extremist? They show up in Omaha once every year for that meeting of other value extremists. They believe the whole world revolves around their idea of value, that the rest of the world is shallow, barbarians, setting prices. So in their view, they hold the high ground, right, their value. So what's going to happen over time, they're open about the fact that they don't care about value at all here's my intrinsic value stuff they say we're traders you know how you make money as a trader you buy at a low price you sell at a high price why you don't care you do it by looking at astrological charts all the more power to you it doesn't have to be something rational you just have to make money and i like that honesty God. You're saying this is revenue growth. These are margins. This is the sales to capital. And to different degrees of uncertainty, depending on the company you're valuing, you're feeling pretty uncertain about the value. So first, let's be quite clear. You value a company. You have an estimate of value.'re spreading your bets. In my response, if you buy only five companies, you must feel really certain about the value you come up with. And they say, yes, you must feel really certain about price adjusting to the value. If you do, if you feel that degree of certainty, by all means concentrate. I'll tell you what I feel. I feel incredible amounts of uncertainty when I value companies. so you valued a company let's say it's the value you get is higher than the price let's say you actually put some money behind this you go buy the stock one approach you can take is what i call the karmic approach what's a karmic approach i don't control this from this point on i've done my work i'm going to go back to living my life a very healthy choice actually but very difficult for most of us to do because you're constantly partly because we get too much feedback causes the change that moves price up to value. But unless you have a direct pipeline to call, this might or might not happen. So let me suggest a couple of other categories. One could be a management change. Management change comes in something that redirects attention to the company, but it could be something that is, that on the face of it looks very, you know, you look at it and say, who cares? I remember when Amazon and Apple both cost across a trillion dollar market company because of this arbitrary line. And what are you hoping? In the process of that scrutiny, maybe people will reassess the company. And I know it's asking for a lot, but you're looking for something that draws attention to the company because you feel that that attention will translate as a catalyst. So let me give you a very simple example of how this plays out in real life. value was 69, I found it undervalued by 21%. Now, one year later, it's overvalued. So you can see, as you look across those numbers, that it goes back and forth, right? And with Apple, you can see why. The core story for Apple stays the same, but people get irrationally exuberant when they sell a lot of iPhone 13s, and they push up the price too much. And they get too depressed when it has one bad quarter. This is the end. I wish Steve Jobs were back, and they sell off all the stock. that percentage of glass. So you can see whether it's a good leading indicator or lagging indicator, but many of you are finding your companies to be overvalued. And part of you saying, I wasted 10 weeks of my rate. I get a grade, but this is such a, I'm going to be able, I'm not going to be able to buy the stock. Don't give up on it because it could be overvalued today, but a year from now to be undervalued. So this'll tell you the story, the Wizard of Oz, and don't jump down my throat because you think the story doesn't make sense. It's not my story. It's a Wizard of Oz story. So here's what happens in the story. This girl called Dorothy is living in Kansas. I don't know what else to describe, but they're small people. And she says, I want to get back to Kansas. How do I do it? They said, we have no idea. We don't even know what Kansas is. But go ask the Wizard of Oz. She says, how do I get to the Wizard of Oz? She says, follow the yellow brick road. And for three and a half hours, the movie's really long, that's all she does. She hops and she skips. She never walks. If you watch the movie, she hops and she skips hours on this brick road coming to you and at this stage the curtain falls a wardrobe malfunction from those days I guess and they see there's no wizard behind the curtain there's this guy pulling strings and rods and he's they realize there's no wizard of us it's a terrible story right three and a half hours later but it turns out that each of them when I compute after-tax cash flows. With ChatGPT, you could say, what would Aswath Damodaran ask you to use as a tax rate? And you get an answer, right? So life's so easy. And I think along the way, we've lost something of immense value, which is we don't try to reason our way to an answer. You know already everything you need to be able to answer that question. If you said, what am I do here? You're going to be tempted to send an email and you're welcome to do it. I questions, even if you get them wrong. So with that long lead in, let's turn to the second packet. If you didn't bring the second packet, not a big deal, but at some point you need to get. Let's talk about pricing. I'm sorry, did I lose something? things, how much would I pay for this? That's what pricing is. So if you think of baking down pricing, there's three parts to pricing. First is to price something, you need to find other things just like it. In real estate, how does this work out to price a house? You're trying to find other houses in the neighborhood. But I was supposed to go to opening day Yankee Stadium with my son who works at a hedge fund, but horrific. This is a great service they're providing, right? But you know how they rank the deals? They look at all the tickets in that you do that you get a multiple standardizing the price you can compare across these companies so you get comparables you standardize the price and if you're careful you ask questions like you did with p ratio what's the growth rate what's the risk how now what's the return equity you control for differences all pricing that's essentially the based on a multiple incomparables. PE ratio, this company looks cheap because based on these 15 other companies. Am I surprised? Not in the least. Equity research is a pricing job. You know why? Because I put you in a sector. What do I ask you to do? Tell me the three companies I should buy. Tell me the two companies I should sell given this sector. So much of what passes for valuation in equity research is pricing. I said, maybe it's different in corporate finance. claimed to be discounted cash flow valuations. But then I took a closer look and I realized, and I might've used this term before, but I'll use it again, that they were really pricing in drag. What's a drag part? Remember the biggest number in a discounted cash flow valuation is the terminal value. The terminal value came from using eight times EBITDA. This isn't a discount. So even in acquisitions, it seemed to be pricing all the time. Does that surprise me? Not in the least. Because how does a banker make money on an acquisition when a deal gets done? It's much less work than a discounted cash flow valuation. Now that you've done both, if you had to hang your hat on one of these approaches, which one would you pick? And in the 30 years that I've been teaching the class, the numbers are pretty consistent. Let's see if this semester it varies. It's about 70, 20, 10. 70% pick intrinsic valuation, perhaps reflecting my biases. 20% say this pricing kind of misciple. I was going to say an email, but who knows whether emails are still around. But I'm going to ask you the question, I remember five years ago when you left my class, I asked you this question. What exactly are you you think I'm crazy, you should see the guy who lives across the hall from me. You know who lives across the hall from Jerry? A guy called Kramer. And I ask you a question, relative to Kramer, is there anybody crazy? This is the advantage of pricing. We forget how much a valuation is selling. It's so much easier to sell a pricing than a valuation. I'm trying to sell a company that's trading at a hundred times revenues. You balk. You value a company, then you've got to defend the valuation. And when you do a full-fledged valuation, your insights are out there for everybody to pick apart. Think about your DCF. I said, why is your revenue growth so high? Why are your margins going up to 35%? Why are you reinvesting so little? Your cost of capital looks low. I'm just picking apart your valuation because I can see every piece of your valuation. In contrast, let's assume you told me that you were the time, maybe 60% of the time. I think if you do good pricing, maybe you'll be right 52% of the time. 60 beats 52, right? But here's the catch. When you're wrong with intrinsic valuation, you're far more likely to be wrong alone. You see why? With intrinsic valuation, you're often buying things when everybody else is selling. You're selling things when everybody else is buying. pricing jobs. I want to make you better pricers and I want to give you the tools to price things better. Because even if you're a true believer in valuation, I think you need to understand the pricing process. So if your job is pricing, of course, you need to understand the price. But even if you are a true believer, and here's what, to make money on your valuation, what has to happen? The price has to move to value. But they're all market numbers. So the numerator is always, what is the market paying for this company? In the denominator, here are your choices. You can divide that number by revenues. Why would you do that? random, you don't want to use the word random, something that might give you revenues in the future. Now, do you see the rationale for using users? It's not irrational. You're saying, I don't have revenues, so I'm going to divide by the number of users, number of subscribers, number of downloads, number of people looking at my website. It sounds irrational, but the denominator needs to be a positive number. You're saying, what if I don't even have that? they're not going to do capex and working capital. They want to stop at net income plus depreciation. Or if you're looking at the entire firm, you can do free cash flow to the firm. And again, that's a lot of work. So people take the shortcut, which is stake operating income, add back depreciation amortization, which is EBITDA. Or you can divide by what accountants tell you your company's work. Where do they tell you that? On the balance sheet, they give you a book value of equity, the p-e ratio is i'm a junior at nyu i know that when i was six years old i've been trading stocks forever i'm going to challenge you on that when you talk about p-e and i talk about p-e are we talking about the same thing so i'm going to start with defining the multiple and putting it through a couple of tests to make sure it passes those steps second step i'm going to describe the $15 million. And people make, you know, invest huge amounts of money. And Billy Bean, after the fifth or sixth time, based on this rule of thumb, said, these guys have no idea what they're talking about. So at least in the movie, he hires Jonah Hill, who's a young MIT graduate who comes in and says, we have the data. What's your objective in baseball? You've got to get around the bases and score. It's a very simple sport, if you think about it. And they discovered he was getting to first base a lot more than all these star hitters who had the right. The guy called Kevin Euclid. I absolutely hate because I'm a Yankee fan and you end up with a Red Sox player and he got on base a lot more than I ever wanted him to. But that's data driving a decision. So essentially he said, hey, analyze the multiple. What does that mean? Remember, I promised that behind every multiple are the assumptions you're running away from cash flows, growth, and risk. They're in there. I'm going to give you a mechanism for determining what those variables are, which will let you ask the right question the next time somebody to be an equity value as well. If your numerator is a firm or an enterprise value, your denominator has to be a firm or an enterprise value as well. No idea what I'm talking about, right? Late in the evening, you had a long day. So I'm going to hit you with a couple of actual multiples. You tell me whether they pass this test. Let's take P ratios. What's in the numerator? Equity value, firm value, enterprise value. this multiple should be tarred, feathered, and driven out of the fraternity if one exists. This is a horrifically bad multiple. And out of the 550 equity research reports I had, 10 used price to avatar. One of them happened to be somebody who had taken this class. I recognize them. He had an unusual last name. back stock. It removes the equity. So basically, the equity will shrink from a billion to 420 or 450. So the equity is shrunk. What happens to EBITDA? It's before interest taxes and depreciation. The more levered you get, the cheaper you're and different degrees of fidelity to those standards. In other words, you didn't have to break the rules, but there's enough leeway that if you're an aggressive company using the same accounting rules, you can report higher income than a conservative company. And if I'm not careful, I'm going to keep finding aggressive companies to look cheap because they're free. I said, this is amazing. This is days before Wi-Fi and iPhones. So I get the calculator in the mail. It's this cheap little piece of crap. It comes with instructions on how to compute the P-E ratio, and here's what it says. Enter the price. Hit the slash. They said the slash. Enter the earnings per share. Hit equal. I got exactly what I deserved, right? Price divided by earnings per share. No wonder it was free. and you know in tennis every two games you switch sides because you don't want the sun in your eye it's not fair so to the middle of a tennis match they're switching sides and for whatever reason anna turns to this actress and says price earnings ratios price divided by earnings per share and then he kept she kept going on something about preferred dividends that went completely over my head now i remember turning off the commercial saying does anna konnikova really know what the failing PE. I can divide price per share by expected earnings per share in the next four quarters, which is called forward PE. Or I can divide price per share by expected earnings per share in the year 2030, which is called really, really forward PE. Say, why would I do that? Again, desperation. You're the biotech analyst. Every company in your sector is losing money. The only tool you have that you would know how to use is PE ratios. You know what you do? You project the earnings out for every company 10 years forward. So that company looks cheap. It's range or the high end of the range to convince me it's cheap? You're going to go with the 40. And if you want to convince me Cisco is expensive, you're going to go with 60. The next time you watch an analyst on CNBC, I'm not suggesting you watch CNBC, but if you're in the habit of watching CNBC, if you see a bullish analyst, notice they will always use forward earnings. You know why? Because expected earnings are higher the actual number of shares. I'm sorry, I could divide net income by the actual number of shares outstanding. neither here nor there. You're still going to have biases. You're saying, what should I do? I'll tell you what you need to do, but nobody will ever do this. What's causing the problem here? I have options. And options are not zero-one securities. They don't lose all value when they go below the exercise price. So what did we do in discounted cash flow valuation to deal with options, right? We value the options as options. You know what you'd need to do? example. I want somebody who might have interned at an investment bank or an equity research department to volunteer themselves to be my guinea pig now. Anybody want to? Come on, I will make you look really good. I'll make you look brilliant. No, nobody wants to do this. The fastest growing multiple in years. You want to be? Okay, good. So EV tab it does. when we compute the smart. Well, you net that because it's one of the ways that you can assume that your cash balance can be used to immediately pay off any debt obligations. So should I be netting out all liquid assets then? Well, it depends. For some valuations, I remember we used cash for a lot of those periods. For some valuations, we did just cash. But what if I have some receivables that I can convert to cash by factoring them? Should I net those out? I think it's below. In other words, my EBITDA doesn't include the interest income from cash. I'm taking cash out because the income from cash is not part of my denominator. I've now opened a Pandora's box because in addition to netting cash out of the numerator, you know what I should also be netting out? What's the other big asset category whose income doesn't show up as part of my operating income? We dealt with this in DCF with emerging market companies of a lot of these. your cash, your debt, your EBITDA are all 100% of the subsidiary. Do you know how analysts adjust for it? If you wanted a quick fix to enumerate it, to bring in the portion you don't own, what's the number in the balance sheet that supposedly captures that 40% that doesn't belong to you? Minority interest. You will see people adding minority interest enumerated. The reason they're doing it is to try in some half-assed way at least to get consistency. Of course, you have P ratios, you have EBITDA multiples, the S&P 500. You see, is there a metric I can compute in real estate, which will tell me whether I'm paying too much for real estate? There's actually a metric that some housing valuers appraise, the macro housing people use. And here's what they do. They take the price of a house, a median price or an average price or whatever price of a house is, and they divide it by the rental income you would get today if you rented that house out. You see what they're trying to compute, right? price, I'm looking at the entire price of the house. I'm not looking at how much equity invested in the house. I'm looking at the total price of the house. So it's more like enterprise value than equity value because you look at the whole price of the house. And the question is, what is rental income like? Is it like revenues? Is it like EBITDA? Is it like, no. It's a tough call, right? Because you collect rental income. Remember, interest expenses, you can't count in anymore because you're looking at enterprise value. What are the standard variables you compute on the data? It's almost automatic. Average standard deviation. Start with that, but don't stop. To me, the most useful part of this descriptive data is the visual part, seeing the histograms. Because by itself, everything else is abstract, right? Mean. So you can take Excel and compute every conceivable. Remember, I do this at the start of each year, start of 2023. Current P would usually be 2021 data, right? Because the most recent fiscal year hadn't shown up yet. Trailing P would be through September of 2022. And forward P would probably be from September 2022. At least I'm being consistent on each. And then I draw the histogram. It's not rocket science And there's the reason. There's a PE ratio of 86,400. There's a very low PE ratio, but there's no negative PE ratio to offset it. But there's one more number I want you to look at. Look at the top. It says number of companies, 7,165, but only 3,099 seem to have made it into my PE ratio sample. So why did I lose the other 4,000 plus companies? What happened? because if you go to my website, I report average PE or PE by sector. And when I first started doing this, the way I did it was I took the companies which had PE ratios and averaged across them. So let's take a sector with 350 companies, but only 20 are positive earnings. I should take those 20 companies, average the 20 and say, this is the PE ratio. That's not right. Because 330 companies I'm throwing out, there's buyers. So here's what I do now, I lose another 600 companies. Why is that? What do I need for forward P? I need expected earnings next year. There is zero chance that I'm estimating expected earnings each for each of 7,165 companies. So you know what I rely on, right? Capital IQ actually gives you expected earnings per share next year that analysts have projected for this company. So you know what 600 companies are loose? Companies that are not fall advantage. What kinds of companies will those be? that I showed you for U.S. companies that go to Sao Paulo or Mumbai or you know, and I'd show the graph and some grisly 50, 60, 70-year-old analyst would put up his hand and say, it doesn't look like anything like that in Mumbai. I said, anything like what? Well, it peeked to the left and tailed to the right. It doesn't look like that for Indian stocks. He said, how do you know? The gut feeling. I said, I don't trust your gut. So I said, I'm going to think about what it is that causes PE ratios to vary across markets, because that's going to be the building block for what we start with next session. I will see you on Monday. And incidentally, if you haven't sent in your DCFs yet, I am leaving the window slightly ajar, and if you send it, I will get it back to you, okay?", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 12.0], "text": " um"}, {"timestamp": [19.28, 151.59], "text": " hi So, I'm not the Pope.
