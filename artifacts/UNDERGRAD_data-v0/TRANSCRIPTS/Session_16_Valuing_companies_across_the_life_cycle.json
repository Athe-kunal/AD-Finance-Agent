  "text": " Okay, folks. I will send this email out this evening with a second quiz review and pass quizzes in case. No, but you need to be able, you can't do both at the same time. Think of your evaluation as part preparation for your quiz and it'll make it a little easier. So just those two things. Finally, I've been checking the master list. There are a few of you still haven't either picked a company or told me the company you've picked. Try to be higher. So I'm going to read a few statements about how you would characterize this. And you're going to give away a lot more than you intend to by which answer you pick. The first is that you are right and the market is wrong. How many of you think that that is the best explanation? Good, because if that were the case, you've got an ego problem that's so big wrong. Why? Because the market is, I mean, think of it as a Yelp review of a restaurant versus your own review of a restaurant. Yelp review is not perfect. I've gone to restaurants with five-star reviews and said, who ate at this restaurant? This is the crappiest food I've ever eaten. You can't account for people's mistakes. Same thing is true for markets. Markets make mistakes. You make mistakes. You're saying, what the heck do we do with this? You just have to hope that your mistake is smaller than the market's mistake. You revenues it takes a lot of courage to pick a company like that right so what do your cash flows look like even in your most optimistic scenarios next year two years out three years out that's a in your optimistic scenario zero and the most realistic scenarios they're going to be big negative numbers because the company in fact for most of your value young companies come up with fresh capital in year one to cover the minus a billion. You're implicitly assuming they're going to be able to raise that capital. Have you told me from where? What did you do to your cost of capital? You gave me weights for debt and equity. So you said 90 percent equity, 10 percent debt. Do you think 90 percent of that billion has to come from issuing new shares? 10 percent might be from debt. You think so? no, I can see in your cash flows, you have to issue new shares. It seems like I'm being deliberately blind to those share issuances. Anybody want to give a shot at why I'm not counting those additional shares? Or am I just screwing up? That could always be a possibility. Why am I not counting the extra shares? What does this negative cash flow do to your value back equity today? See, let's say you have negative cash flows in year one, year two, year three, year four. usually in the present value. You know, it sounds abstract, but when I do my Amazon valuation, I'll actually quantify how much of that dilution effect already is in my value and why I don't need to count the extra shares. So with that lead in, let's go back to the Amazon page, which is where we left off last session. the losses become profits. And I'll talk about how I'm getting the margins in the intermediate years, but I start with minus 36.7. I end up at plus 10. And for the reinvestment, I use the sales to capital ratio. And this is actually the first valuation where I concocted a sales to capital ratio. And it was after struggling with every other approach I'd ever been taught in estimating Notice the word, I use the word plural, because there can't be one cost of capital because the company is changing too much over the next 10 years. I start with a cost of capital of 12.84% when Amazon is a young money losing company. But as you go through time, take a look at what's happening to my cost of capital. As a company becomes larger and more money making, the cost of capital decreases to 9.61%. 77 million. You can't discount it back seven years at 11.62%. You got to take 1.1284 and take the product of those costs of capital because your costs of capital are changing over time. You take those present values and the elephant in the room, of course, the terminal value of 52 billion, what you get as a present value is 15. The value per share I get is $35.08. Forget the 8 cents, $35. Is this an upbeat story that I'm telling? Revenues go from a billion to 41 billion. Margins go from a big negative number to a big positive number. They're reinvesting incredibly efficiently. And in spite of telling the upbeat story, theued, I'm fairly willing to jump in and buy that stock. Here I've come up with a company that is overvalued. Obviously you're not asking me, am I buying? What's the analogous question you would ask me here? Am I shorting? It's exactly the question I got asked at the end of this valuation. And I said, not in this lifetime. The natural response I got is don't have clients to answer to. I have my spouse to answer to, but I turned off statements to paperless a long time ago. She doesn't even know what's in our portfolio. I'm willing to wait as long as it takes, and I can wait. Whereas when you sell short, what exactly are you doing? Can anybody tell me what selling short is? not only do I have to feel confident that I've got the value right, but I have to feel confident that the adjustment will happen in the next six weeks. And that's one of the great asymmetries in investing. When something is undervalued, there is a bargain basement strategy, it's buy and hold. When something is overvalued, it's difficult to find an equivalent long-term strategy that you can use to take advantage of as they do. So I want to talk about this valuation, but I want you to remember that because many of you will find your companies to be overvalued. And I'm going to ask you to buy or sell, but selling short requires not, it's just not, it's not a question of confidence, being able to get enough of a time horizon where even if you're right, you're able to make money. So let's look at some of the lessons you can extract from this valuation. the standard error is 0.5. See the range you're going to get in the beta? It's somewhere between 1.2 and 3.2. That does you when valuing Amazon. With young companies, regression betas become incredibly noisy. So even if you are attached to using regression betas from mature companies, don't do it for young companies. Think, what's the choice? What do we do as a counter to regression betas? We said, estimate a bottom-up beta. And for Amazon, Second, I'm going to give away the secret sauce. You know what the chef said, don't come into the kitchen, you want to see how I'm making the meal. I'm going to take you into the kitchen so you can see where the 42% compounded revenue growth comes like. So here's what I did. I downloaded data in every retail company. Because I wanted to get a sense of what does big revenue look like for a retail company. The largest retail company in 2000 was Walmart with $180 billion in revenues. The first question asked was, if Amazon succeeds, will it look like Walmart? And in 2000, my answer was, I don't think so. It's not a discount retailer. It wants a better margin. I'd like to get. And you say, how do you come up with those revenue growth rates in year one, two, three? I made them up. You didn't mishear me. I made them up. And if you made a really big deal about year one and say, you know what? I think the revenue growth rate is going to be 163.33%. You can have it. You want your two? Take it too. If you give me the final number, the end number, I control the valuation. You know, when you get the FCFF overreacting, don't you think? What did you see in that report card? No. But that's basically how when people react to early earnings reports, you feel like, what are you reacting to? It's the end game that drives the valuation focus on the long term. So that's the revenue part. So any questions on, so that's where the 42% came from. It's from trying to get to 400 billion, I'm sorry,, it'll have very little effect on your final value. That's why it's not worth finessing. The only rule is as you scale up, it's going to get more and more difficult to get high growth rate. So make the growth rate decrease as you get bigger, because delivering the same increase in revenues in year three will give you a lower growth rate than delivering it in year two. You're building off lower. Now let's talk about minus 37? I'll give you a clue. It's got nothing to do with exponentials, logs. Don't think high-level math. Think third-grade math. How do you think I've come up with those numbers? Anybody want to try to figure them out? I'll give you a starting point. me towards my margin pretty quickly. It's a pathway to profitability. Let's say you agree with every other part of my Amazon valuation, but you think the pathway to profitability is going to be a lot more rocky for Amazon than I think it is. You know what you can do? Take the half and make it a quarter. So that's an input. If I do that, what happens? I move a quarter of the distance each year. I'm going to lose more money%, you can have it. You want your two? Have that tip. The end game is what's driving the valuation. So if you take the revenues, multiply them by the margins, you come up with expected those animals. So there's my after-tax operating income. Hopefully this takes the mystery away. It looks like there are lots of assumptions, but it actually is three assumptions, revenue growth, one year after the IPO, the revenue growth is 15% higher than the second. You say, this is why I bought the IPO, they're much faster growing. You track the same IPOs two years after, their revenue growth is about 7% higher than the sector. Three years after, it's 3% higher than the sector. By the time you get to year five, you cannot tell the star company apart off the bat. Where's your upside? You priced it to be the very best. So I stopped at 10 years, not because I don't know that companies can grow for longer than 10 years, but because I feel from an intrinsic value standpoint that if you continue to grow after 10 years, it should be icing on the cake for me, not the cake itself. Because it's something I need to claim as an investor. Let's talk about reinvestment. less efficient in delivering growth. Second, that reinvestment you have also becomes the change in your invested capital each year. This is always true in free cash flow valuation is whatever you show as reinvestment becomes the delta in your invested capital. You're saying, so what? If you look at the bottom three lines of your valuation output from your spreadsheet, here's what I do. I keep track of your after-tax operating income based on your growth and margins. I also keep with Amazon. The return on capital I got in year 10 was 20.39%. And I was okay with that. Why was I okay with it? Remember, this was in 2000. The T-bond rate was 6.5%. Very different time. The average return on capital for retail companies was about 17%. And I felt that Amazon was special enough that it could earn a higher return on capital. So if you get a chance, go back and look at that return on capital you get in year 10 for your company and ask yourself, am I okay with that return on capital? It talked about dilution. Let me go back and fill in the gaps. When you have young companies, money losing companies, cash burning companies, companies with negative free cash flows, it is true% for those negative cash flows, I'd be double counting if I then brought in the additional shares I'd be issuing to cover those negative cash flows into the denominator. Yes. Then you don't have, then the cash flows are positive. And in fact, that's a good question to ask. When you have positive free cash flows to firm and you discount them, what are you effectively assuming the company is going to be doing each year? lowering the share count at the same time. So when you do a discounted cash flow valuation, don't worry about share count or changes in share count over time. The present value should already take care of it. When I valued Amazon in 2000, I make a confession. Those negative cash flows in year six, I assumed that the company would be able to raise the capital to keep going. Is that a safe assumption? In 2000, I did not have a failure rate in my spreadsheet, and it was a mistake. It was a mistake because I was missing the fact that young companies can fail. 2001, I learned my lesson. That's when failure rates first showed up in my spreadsheet because I said, if a company is unable to raise the cash flows, it is likely to fail. The problem with the failure rate is, if you ask me, how can I best estimate the failure rate, my answer is going to be kind of fuzzy. starting up in each business and they track what percentage of these companies make it through year one make it through year two make it through year three let's look at the from this graph what that that's statistically this was in the 2007 starting the next page i'll give you the update if you fail? What percentage of value you're going to get back? You're not going to get 100% back. You're going to get 50% back, 30% back, 20% back, or nothing back. And I incorporate that into your value of equity by saying 30% of the time, accident away from God knows what. I would think that with the Boeing, you've got to factor in a likelihood of failure. And there you have an advantage. You have a rating. You can use the rating to make that judgment. But I think it gives you more realistic estimates of value for companies if you bring that failure rating. What do VCs do about this? should make you feel a lot better right when you value companies any companies but especially with young companies you're going to come with a value you're going to look and say how do i know i'm right i'll save you the trouble you're wrong you're definitely wrong you're probably hopelessly wrong you're wrong a hundred and potentially walk away with an advantage because most people are not even trying. So I get to the end of my Amazon webcast. My value is $35, the stock price is $84, and somebody in the audience asked me the question, maybe it's in here somewhere. Oh, right there. Somebody asked me, is it possible that Amazon is worth $84 per share? See the yellow shaded boxes? So this company, or the case of Amazon in 2000, if they could grow at 50% a year and have 14% margins, they'd be worth more than 84. If they could grow at 55% a year and have 10% margin, they're worth 86. And if they could grow at 60% a year and have 8% margins. companies is worth any money. So I said, okay. So in 2001, I revalued Amazon. And it was a very eventful year. You had the economy go into recession, the dot-com boom had bust, and the worries about capital being raised had increased. So my value went from $35 down to about $20 per share. I remember I finished the valuation and somebody in the audience said, about time horizon. I bought Amazon for the first time at the start of 2001. How long did I hold? I've been told, especially old-time value investors, what's the rule? Buy and hold for the rest. I never understood that. How can that be consistent with the value investing philosophy? Because you buy when something is undervalued. What should you sell? When it's overvalued. Which is work, I bought Amazon for the most recently, six months ago. But my point is, when you value something and you find it overvalued, don't give up on it. You've done the hard work. You've built up a valuation for the company. Revisit it. Maintenance valuations actually take about 20 minutes every year. Basically, you update the numbers. You revisit your story. The price is going to change. Your stock can go from being overvalued to undervalued over the course of a year. they actually came in lower, but if you extend that, they grew for longer than I thought they would. So my revenue growth, I clearly underestimated how much they could grow. There are my margins. There are the actual margins. They undershotted my margins. Whatever I learned about Amazon, I've often called Amazon my field of dreams company. Have you seen the movie Field of Dreams, Kevin Costner? If you haven't, Kevin Costner builds a and in a sense you could see this with amazon they went for revenue growth at the expense of margins it's a perfectly viable strategy but it's a it's a lesson i learned so i valued amazon in 2012 i factored that lesson and this is a company that can that has patience built into its dna and essentially will keep doing this and the other thing i changed was i thought of amazon as a retail company i thought that's where they would end up Do you think FedEx thinks about Amazon? The largest logistics company. But there were some surprises. JPMorgan Chase was asked to list five potential competitors. And you know who came up on the list of top five? Amazon. And there's a reason for that, right? Because every east coast to the west coast. I moved from a JPMorgan Chase branch here to a JPMorgan Chase branch there. And they charged me $45. And so what the heck did you do? Take my money, convert it to cash, put it in the back of a mule and send it across. Why $45? Because they can. You know what should terrify JPMorgan Chase? That tomorrow Amazon sends me an email saying, we're starting Amazon Bank. Would you be interested? I'll be there in a second. The date should be up there. But you can see that this is Amazon valued as a disruption platform. And the advantage of being a disruption platform is what's your potential market? It could be in any business you want. It can be immense. And that gets factored into the valuation. My advice for you is when you tell a story for a company, a mature company stops and says, maybe we need to change the way we do things, often because they get somebody from the outside pushing. Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman say, you need to be different. So let's assume you have a mature company that is in transition, it's going to drive you crazy. So here's my advice. Value the company twice. Once with the status quo, the existing business model, and once with what you see as the new business model. You're going to get two different values. Then you've got to estimate a likelihood that the company will actually change. That expected value is then going to become the value of the company. World War II. The problem is too long to fly. So what happened was, you know, all these soldiers loaded up from the Far East coming to the U.S. and they stopped in Hawaii. And Hawaii then is not like Hawaii today, no five-star hotels. There wasn't enough food to feed hundreds of thousands of hungry soldiers. You can say ask me, cocon So the existing debt ratio reflects that fact. I think their existing debt ratio is about 10%, 90% equity, even though they could afford to borrow money. They don't like to reinvest much. Why? Because they don't like to grow outside the US. They thought of the US as their market. is they felt that the company could actually grow faster if it reinvested more. The higher reinvestment rate. The second is they felt the company could afford to borrow more money. So I increased the debt ratio to 40%. I'll talk about why is the 40%. And I increased the reinvestment rate from 19% down up to 40%, which increases the growth rate. Now, they had to give up some returns. Lower return projects still higher than the cost of capital. So they're going to grow faster and have a lower shareholder in the in in hormel was this was a foundation called the hormel foundation the family had set up a foundation for the shares it owned about 26 percent of the shares they took a look at the hormel foundation maybe they'll be my ally in changing the company you know who headed the hormel foundation the ceo of horm what you have here is the existing debt ratio for the company, 10.39%. I want to find out what the right mix of debt and equity is for the company. And remember, my objective is to minimize my cost of capital. I want to get the lowest cost of capital I can. So I change the debt ratio from zero to 90%. I'm trying to factor in what will happen to interest coverage ratio? It gets smaller because I have more interest expenses. My rating decreases. As my rating decreases, I come up with the cost of debt at each debt ratio. Because remember, we get a default spread for each rating. There's my cost of debt. You adjust for the tax benefit. And at the very high debt ratios, I start losing tax benefit because I don't have enough income to cover the interest expense. There's my cost of capital. This is the right way to figure out because some of you are valuing mature companies. I mean, for the moment, don't do anything crazy. Just value the company as is with the status quo. But leave open that question of what will the value of my company be if somebody else ran the company? There were changes that came to the company. Which brings me to the final piece of this puzzle, valuing declining companies. Let's see what's difficult about valuation with declining companies. When I ask you, what are your last time you valued a company with negative revenue growth? The answer is I've never done, but we know companies shrink. So the question is, how do you bring that in? And you've got to be realistic. You've got to bring in that drop in revenues you see over time. My margins would start low, do improve. So I assume that they're going to be shutting down their least profitable stores first. So think of this as the most upbeat valuation I could think of for JCPenney. But it still looks like a horror story, right? Shrinking revenues, margins leveling off at a low level. But over time, I am saving this company by making its negative cash flows become positive cash flows. Be realistic in forecasting what your company's revenue growth will be. And if you have a company where you think revenue growth is going to be negative, don't have any qualms about putting a minus 5% growth rate. I know some of you are valuing cruise lines. I know at least a couple of people. And one of the issues with cruise line companies is, will the revenues ever come back? Will people come back to cruises? Maybe they will, maybe they will not. But if you have a company where the future looks bleak, then the best thing to do is be realistic and bring in the declining revenues and the shrinking margins into that business. I'm going to stop there. I just said my my nose is running and I can't wipe my nose because I've got this stupid mic in front of me and I've got to get out of here. So I will see you on Wednesday and watch out for the review session for the quiz. I would send it right after class. day. So wherever you are, make sure you're at someplace where wasn't coming from below that you got bob either come back to take over bob chip it came from the fact that they have a company stock usually one of the triggers for a management change is stock prices drop 50 that now because of the elevated chicken rates. And then the next year it'll be like a drop off in that. How about transportation? Transportation? Yeah. Okay. That sounds great. Thank you. Hi. What's the coverage for the first time? It'll be everything from growth, right? Yeah. So I don't have a wish. I know it's personal. I don't change it. Yeah, yeah. But I expect they're going to receive so many subsidies in the next years. And do I work in part for this? The question is, are they going to receive the subsidies, or are the consumers going to receive the subsidies? The consumers. But I think also, like in Europe, they're going to be willing to start from New York to subsidize these companies. They have green bonds and low cost of debt access to them. So to give them, so there are two things you can do, right? make sure you're not building it in perpetuity so if there's a subsidy it's unlikely to be in the terminal value to be in year one year two or three but by the time you get to year 10 everybody's going to be in green energy you're not going to be subsidized because of that okay hi how are you i'm kathleen and you couldn't figure out the solution but my company's 10k for manchester doesn't have the separation percentage of revenues for the different regions it covers",
