  "text": " great So, But hopefully you've all picked a company. You've passed the angst of doing a discounted cash flow valuation. You're in the pricing part. Money losing company. The only advice I have for you is you're one of those young money losing companies. Don't take today's numbers, plug them into regressions because you're going to get predictable values. Like what? You put negative margins, negative accounting returns, which is what they have right now into an EV to sales regression. You're going to get the negative EV to sales ratio. last three weeks that you follow the subject matter because otherwise projects will be all over the place i don't want you submitting them on brightspace it's a pain in the neck for me to download stuff and put it on but piece of advice no excel spreadsheets nothing needed in the final project all you need is your report with your companies your value pricing recommendation options if applicable for your company and as a p optimal debt ratio for a company? How do we define that? What makes it optimal? It minimizes the WAC. So optimal debt ratio is the one that yields the lowest comes along. So the payoff comes from the fact that I take a project with this huge net present value because of excess capacity. So think of that as the upside. What's the downside? That project never comes along, in which case you end up with this higher cost to capital than you need it to, and you have nothing to show for it. I told you it's a difficult option to value, but I'm going to try anyway. to preserve the debt capacity to do great stuff. So what does the great stuff have to be worth? More than 54 basis points a year, right? Because that's what you're giving up by being at this too high a cost to capital. So I'm going to try to put a number on how much financial flexibility is worth using the option pricing framework. So here's what I'm going to do. For the expected reinvestment needs, I'm going to look at how much Disney has as CapEx and working capital each year as a higher cost of capital. Trust me on this one, but if you work through the numbers, I get up a value of about 0.85% of value. The financial flexibility is worth 85 basis points and I'm giving up only 58 basis points to get it. So what's the bottom line? When Disney says we're under levered, we're going to stay under levered because we value financial flexibility. I'm going to look at the numbers and say, you're right. You should stay under levered because you do need to Give you a capital constraint. I would expect small companies to value financial flexibility more than big companies. Why? Because small companies are more capital constrained. I would expect privately owned businesses to value financial flexibility more than publicly traded companies. I would value expect emerging market companies to value financial flexibility more than developed market companies. So capital constraints play a big role. Here's the second factor. And here's a final factor. Why are we preserving the success debt capacity? To take projects, right? But what if you're in a business where a typical project earns the cost of capital? There's zero value to flexibility there. So if you're in the steel business, in the automobile business, don't even talk to me about financial flexibility. I'm not interested in listening to it because there is no value added expect. You're a software company and you want to talk about financial flexibility. I'm willing to listen. it's not for price appreciation. It's not going to double in price. It's a big dividend paying stock. You buy it for the dividends. If you buy, in contrast, Microsoft, why would people be interested in buying Microsoft now? It's one of the best performing stocks this year. Growth, the AI story, it's because you think its value is going to serve. Look, if you bought Bed Bath & Beyond, why would you buy Bed Bath & Beyond? It's definitely not for the dividends, right? means, Dean? What does it mean? You get paid last after. In a typical normal year, after everybody else gets paid, you get whatever's left. And in liquidation, you get whatever's left after every other claim order. It's a residual claim. The second feature of equity is it has limited liability. Yuki, what does that mean, limited liability? You liquidate the company. What happens? You sell the assets. You get the value of the firm. You pay off the debt. Remember, that's not an obligation you can escape. And whatever is left over is yours. So you get that difference. What happens? The value of the firm is less than the face value of the debt. Well, you lose whatever you paid for the equity. That's a limited. That looks like a call option to me. So I'm going to construct a very simplistic example, but this example is going tell me what the value, the equity in this company is worth and what interest rate you would charge on the debt. I haven't given you cash flows. I haven't given you betas, cost of debt, none of that. Here's how I'm going to do it. I'm going to structure the equity in this company as a call option. What is the underlying asset? get that choice but for the next nine years and 364 days you're king of the castle you can do whatever you want now do you see why i made it a zero coupon bond because of the regular coupon bond every year there'd be an interest payment due and if you can't make that payment so for simplicity we've made 10 years zero coupon bond the variance in firm value because i estimated the standard deviation to be 0.4 is 12.77 percent as promised i gave you value for the equity 75.94 i've told you what interest rate i'll be willing to pay on the debt 12.77 percent you circle back though what does nd2 do you remember what nd2 roughly tells me what's the company. You know how they do it? They put it through an option pricing model. They take the N of D2 and one minus N of D2 becomes the likelihood that your company will go bankrupt. So very comfortable, 75.94 million is the Here are your three choices. I took half of the value, $50 million off. Maybe it'll drop to $25.94, $50 million. Maybe it'll drop by less than $50 million, in which case somebody else has to bear the remaining loss. Or maybe you listen to your accountants who are probably going to give you a negative book equity and say this equity is worth nothing. Which do you think is the right choice? Do you think it'll drop by less than $50 million, about $50 million, or more than $50 million? Deep, you share the pain as well. In fact me an entirely different perspective on what bankruptcy actually means. Actually, my daughter, who just turned 28 three days ago, told me this when she was three years old. She's a financial genius. Not really, but we'll act like she is. Very impressive that a three-year-old would know the word bankruptcy. I said, Kendra, what does bankrupt mean? Expecting an answer like the value of your outstanding liability. She said, bankrupt means you don't get to play the game anymore. You know what? That's a very insightful definition of bankruptcy. Because as long as I get to play the game for nine years and 364 days, I'm not bankrupt yet. That's what's keeping the equity afloat. it's a deep out of the money option. I'm going to use this to kind of illustrate another problem as well. In corporate finance, we talk about how incentives are different for equity investors as opposed to lenders. Now to illustrate that danger of what happens when you're a lender to a company, I'm going to take the company we just valued before the catastrophe, 75.94 million in equity, 24.06 million in debt value, the firm is 100 million. 98 million. Remember, net present values are additive. You take a minus $2 million project, the value of the firm drops. You say, there, I told you we shouldn't have done this. It's a risky project. So the 16% variance becomes 0.25. Basically, you've increased the standard deviation of that. Do you remember what the value of your equity was before you took this bad project? 75.94? It's them. I've never understood why banks lend on LBOs as passive lenders. I've never understood how they get away with it. Makes no sense at all to me to let KKR decide what's good for them and say, hey, we're going to go along for the right. They're going on their right. You might not be on that same right. So interesting twist that you can see using the option pricing model. One final example. but what happens if I combine two risky companies? Remember when you did portfolio theory, that first step, you do a two asset portfolio. Variance of the first asset times weight squared of the first asset. Come on, you should remember this from foundations. Weight of the second asset squared times variance of the second asset. Plus, what's the last term? It's a covariance term, right? Two times weight, one weight, two times covariance, it works out if you're a lender to these two you're lenders to both companies why would lenders in both companies be happier after the merger than before the merger it's safer and you lent money at an interest rate that reflected the riskiness of those firms so basically you're charging an interest rate that reflects risky companies and i've created a safer company so if you're a manager in a company that is doing conglomerate this is a classic conglomerate you go buy companies and example saying, how the heck am I going to take my company and make it fit these characteristics? Because the example I showed you is very simplistic. I gave you the value of the company, I gave you a standard deviation, I made it have one nice zero coupon bond due in 10 years. No trouble company ever fits those needs. So I'll give you the way in which I tried to make a real company squeeze through into my simplistic example. You asked me and the bonds of this company are traded, I can again construct a variance in firm value by taking a weighted average, but I'm too lazy to do that. So I'm going to do what I did when we did betas. What did I say was the best way to estimate beta for your company? Look at the average. I actually have bottom-up variances in firm value on my website for difference. So you have a troubled steel company, I give you a variance of a typical steel company. You have a troubled chemical company, I can do an option pricing model. So let me try this out in a real company, company called Eurotunnels, heard of it? It's a hole in the ground where cash goes in, but never seems to come out, connecting England and France. It's been around a long time. It's a history of losing money. Like this was in 1997, when they lost 56 million pounds as operating losses that becomes the S in the model. The value that I got for Eurotunnel, assuming it makes it back to health, was 2.3 billion pounds. Do you remember what it owed in the previous week? How much debt did it have? Almost 9 billion, right? This is with recovery. With margins improving, I get a value of 2.3 billion pounds. Deep out of the money option. And for the variance, I actually computed the standard deviation. I was able to get both Eurotunnel shares and bonds The only saving grace is that debt is really long term. It's not due until 10.93 years. That's a weighted average duration. What I did was I took each individual debt issue, computed the duration of each one, took a weighted average. You could use a weighted average maturity if you, you know, clearly you can get away with it. And the variance is 0.0335. Remember what the probability of failure was in my hypothetical example I computed? put my name on it you can hope right you have 10.93 years to hope when you think about deeply troubled companies you basically have to stop thinking in traditional terms and think in very different terms you have to think of it as an option you see why that matters right so i ask you would you buy a deeply troubled safe company or a deeply troubled risky company but which one should you buy i would always buy the risky one you're buying an option now right you have deeply distressed equity you know what you have right you have companies that are way below water they're saying you know what there's no i need risk as my ally to get above the water the risk is your only chance of making it better what if i thought there are some sectors where i start with the default that i really am getting an option i'll give you my favorite the airline business right 90 of airlines you're not buying a going concern you're not buying a thinking about options in equity. Yes, go ahead, Ashu. Because there's enough transfer of wealth from the lenders for your equity investors equity value above zero, right? Your DCF value was zero or it was actually negative, which is effectively zero. Your pricing, you're probably going to end up with the same zero value because the same factors are going to come in. This might be your only chance of getting, you got actually a positive number with your pricing. Congratulations. This might be your only chance of getting your number above zero. It's the only reason people are buying this company is because, you know, I would like you to come in and talk to them. I said, you got the right, you sure you're talking to the right guy. You know what I think about acquisitions, right? He said, I do, but I would like you to come in and talk to them anyway, because for the rest of the day, they're going to hear from bankers. What do bankers think about acquisitions? It's the mother's milk of all deal-making. Wall Street Journal, the CEO of the acquiring company. So I'm going to give you my very dyspeptic view of what I think about acquisitions. Before I do that, I want to get a sense of how many of you are graduating and going to work in an M&A department at an investment bank? Nobody wants to admit to it. Maybe after this session things is there's a jump on the acquisition day, but there tends to be a drift in the days before, which tells us what? Either remarkably perceptive markets or somebody's leaking information somewhere, right? So there's clearly leakage going on. We want to know from what's causing it. But target company shareholders are clearly the winners. What about acquiring company shareholders? They may, and Activision is a $75 billion company. That almost looks like a wash, that whatever you saw in Activision came out of Microsoft's back. So on the day of the acquisition, clearly, if you ask the acquiring company, shareholders, CFOs, why are you doing this? This is not creating value for us. You know what the response is going to be, right? You haven't seen what we've seen, which is what we've made forecasts of synergy, as far as the the cost of capital. That sounds familiar. It's a question we ask about any project. And then they ask, do parent companies actually do better after acquisitions relative to their peer group than before? Because the synergy is paying off. You should have higher margins, higher returns. And the answer is no to both questions in most mergers. KPMG actually asked a different question. They looked at 9,000 mergers around the world and asked a singular question. What's a word that you see, Shaw, in merger after merger, the big word that explains away off. In fact, half of all mergers are reversed within 10 years of being done because they don't work. So the collective evidence on acquisitions is not a good one. Until about 20 years ago, all of this evidence came from looking at U.S. companies because that's where the data was. And until about 20 years ago, if you look at an acquiring company, a target company, acquiring company usually came from a developed market, U.S. company let's push the price up and then the hangover kicks in saying that wasn't good so by 24 months after you're saying I wish they hadn't done that what I'm trying to say is this is a problem globally it occurs across time and across across different markets which tells me that there's something wrong with the process right why because and you can't be it's not because they're bad people but because we've loaded the incentive structure because if one of the bankers comes to you and says look this is a bad deal let's not do it it's very honest of that banker but what do you get out of it nothing so what i'd like to do is actually take you through the seven most common sins in acquisitions so actually when i did this in front of the cf I ask CFOs and merchants is, can you value synergy? And they say, maybe, maybe not. It's subjective. I say, are you paying in subjective dollars for this acquisition or objective dollars? The minute you pay a $25 billion premium, if you lost that subjective, I can't make an estimate. Of course, it can be valued an acquisition. The CEO has some dream in the middle of the night, and he wakes up and says, you know what, I want to do an acquisition. And then the process plays out. And there's a final component of acquisition that really bugs me. You're a manager of a company, you take a bad project, you lose 20 million, you get fired. You're a manager of a company, you do a terrible acquisition, you pay a $ it do? You don't need reinvestment. Your after-tax operating income becomes your free cash flow to the firm. So you have 12 million in free cash flow to the firm. This company is all equity finance. I told you I was going to keep things simple and the cost of equity is 20%. So your cost of capital is also 20%. You ready? Here's my first question. Forget about the acquisition. If I asked you to keep overpaying, right? Because now I know you're a sucker. So what do I do? I find every risky company I can. I'm going to come and say, look, it looks cheap. And it will look cheap to you because you apply it. This is how AT&T drove itself from being a $100 billion company down built up Jack Welch days, the largest market cap company in the world. I got invited to Stanford, which is where their headquarters were, and said, can you come and talk to our divisional heads? I don't know what got into my head. I said, yes. I show up and there's like an amphitheater there with the divisional heads. And I go through, I did that as anonymous because GE was an acquisitive company. I get to this point and I say, should value or target company using its risk profile, acquisition, right? You just overpaid collectively. There is no excuse for using an acquiring company's cost of equity, but half of all acquisitions, I see acquiring companies' cost of equity being used to value target companies. Second step. So that didn't work on you because you were too sensible. You've taken pay more than 60 million. So I'm now saying, look, because you have access to a lot of cheap debt and you have a lot of you know, why do you use a 12% cost of capital? It's more reasonable, right? After all, you have access to cheap debt. What's wrong with doing that? What's wrong with taking your cost of debt as the acquiring company, your capacity to borrow money or its cheap debt into the mix. You might still use it. I'm not saying you shouldn't use it, but don't bring it in value to the target company because you're going to then pay a premium for something the target company shareholders have no role in creating. You see, it's really making it really difficult for me to acquire a company student, which has every acquisition and taking the difference between the price paid in an acquisition versus the market price before the acquisition. It's the average premium pay. You say, what's wrong with using that? What goes into that premium? Some of it is for control, right? What else is in there? Synergy. What about stupidity? When you overpay for something, where does it go? It goes in the premium as well. company with you running it you're going to replace the 20 margin with the 30 margin your 12 million will become 18 million your 60 million will become 90 million in value you see why nothing else is changing you've added that's your value of control would you wait should you pay the 30 million as your premium on the acquisition if you did what have you done you've taken the 30 million control because the company already is well managed. In fact, in the next session, we'll actually get an expected value for control for any company. It's easy to do. It requires you value the company twice, status quo, run differently, run by you. So that's a value control, which brings us to that magical word synergy. I'll give you my definition of synergy. It's going to be very specific. And the reason I'm going to be specific is I think people use the There are very few synergies in publicly traded companies that show up in discount rates. Because you have two public companies coming together, there's very little argument you can make that somehow magically you can create a public company that has a lower cost of capital just because you combine two public companies. And here again, you'll have to confront the issue. After you valued synergy, you have to decide what share of that belongs to you. Because remember, you need both the acquiring and the target company to show up. be operating synergy or financial synergy. Let's do operating synergy first. The easiest operating synergy to value is economies of scale, cost savings. What kinds of mergers are you most likely to see cost savings or economies of scale. But let's talk about the mergers that show up in growth. First, it can be in the form of a higher return on capital you earn on your existing project. As a combined company, you're able to earn a 12% return on capital over 10% return on capital. This is a combined firm, you're strong. It could be that you can reinvest more. A developed market brand name company buys an emerging market brand name company that they can take more To me, I mean, I look at mergers, about 70% of synergies and mergers are financial synergies. And the most common financial synergy is like the, I call it the Voldemort synergy, a synergy that should not be named. Don't talk about it. This is the reason. What am I talking about? Tax savings. If you're saying I'm doing this merger for tax CNBC anchor asked him, well, why are you planning on doing this merger? And the CEO says, because we want to save on taxes. I remember hitting my head against the wall saying, what are you doing? Because you could see exactly what was going to happen after the CNBC interview. The IRS started saying, you know, we will take a look at this merger. Senators start taking over the floor saying this is about saving taxes. Two weeks Brazil about 30 years ago, the Brazilian government decided that because the tax law was tilted towards that, how interest expense is deductible, they were going to try to make it fair by giving an equivalent tax deduction for equity. And the way it works in Brazil, it's called interest in capital. You're allowed to take your book equity, and every other government will give you a percentage number, 12%. So you take 12% of book equity, you're allowed to claim it as a tax deduction. You're saying, so what? What happens to your book equity after a merger? If a public company uses the argument that they're doing an acquisition just for diversification, what should you push back with? I can diversify. I've never paid a 30% premium. Have you guys paid a 30% premium? Go on Schwab, I'd like to pay a 30% premium. You pay at market price, right? When you do an acquisition, a company does it, it has to pay a 20, 25, 30% premium. If the only reason is diversification, I can old family group companies in Asia and Latin America, take a look at what businesses they're in. You know what you're going to very quickly find? They're in everything. But that's how they survived, because until about 40 years ago, before public markets, that's how family groups survived. You don't want to be a family group steel company. You want to be a family group in steel and chemicals and financial services. You create, in a sense, your own diversification within the values that you got in step 1 together. What is that going to give me? It's going to give me the value of the combined company if there were no synergy. Step 3, throw everything but the kitchen sink into the value set. I think this merger will cut costs, increase growth rate, reduce cost to capital. I'm going to put that all in. And in step 3, I'm going to value the combined company with all the synergies built in. So what should I get in step i named the combined company piglet that's not the name they chose brockman gamble they decided to stay with brockman gamble but let's call it piglet to separate it from png before so it's piglet after piglet without synergies were 281 billion and then i did a best case valuation. In fact, let me throw to you a few what ifs. What if I have to wait three years for the synergy to show up? After all, these are two big companies. It'll take a while for the synergy to show up. You want those NOLs. $2 billion in NOLs. What's the cashflow benefit of getting an NOL? What is it? How does it help you? Pays less in taxes, right? So if you have a 36% tax rate, and this is how most bankers deal with NOLs, they multiply the tax rate by the NOL, which would give you $7 the risk-free rate. But to the extent that operating income is uncertain, I'd have to discount those tax savings back. And that's effectively why you see me use NOLs carried into time in my DCF model, is I don't allow you to take the tax benefit right away. I look to see when you make the income and I discount those tax benefits back to today at the cost of capital. numbers. Here's my advice to you. Whenever you have these acquisitions, there's always somebody in the company who's pushing really hard for the acquisition. They wanted to get that. They hire the bankers. They've marshaled them through the process. I would make that person responsible for delivering the numbers that I base the acquisition on. Okay. You think there's a lot of synergy? We'll do it. But by the way, you are responsible for delivering. You'll be amazed at I have a question about the reading of the book. you you you I'm going to go over to capital markets. I realize. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. They want to review. That's probably meant. I think our student, Jerry's't think we are. Oh. you Hey, you you you you All right. Oh, there you go. There you go. So how's the volume here? How's the volume there? It's too much. Check, check. Mic check. One, two, one, two. Check, check, check. I think it's a really good time to get on board with the new idea. I think it's a really good time to get on board with the new idea. I think it's a really good time to get on board with the new idea.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. um people i mean and then we can grab one and bring it. Yeah, let's do one, two, five. Right now though, we're just trying to have a great inter- The regulation on the I think that was a pretty long I was gonna say a lot of the same We're trying to get last of the game. That was a good last of the game. I should have been extended and then I had to watch them up. That's all we have. Yeah. Are they gonna be fine? Yes. Can we slam more rounds? Well, we're not gonna. Yeah. We did all the three of nine. We've not read 3,000 comments. And we've incarcerated a lot of them. So yeah, you're going to have to pay money. Right. But it's sad because say like a year from now, a year and a half, the amount of money we're generating is going to be a lot. But we need it now. do. And so there's a lot of noise around constantly, but like, the last century, so it is going to be the same to the fireplace. And the next one, bro, you know, it's, it's working. It's not working. Yeah, we really got to get some Maybe I have problems also hearing some stores and so on. So like, even, you know, back in the day when it was like, there's risks with going first, like the question wasn't figured out yet. And a lot of where it was on the screen. So. people yeah",
