  "text": " All about the micro. You bring one down. That was all because they're supposed to be an over the year. Yeah, microphone here anymore so that's not good. testing testing testing testing thank you it should be good now thank you okay folks work with you guys. So today we're going to start with the three things on the agenda today. One is I want to talk about bias. How your priors and preconceptions affect your valuations. So that's the start of the class test. Incidentally, the start of the class test, I will not give out slides. They're on the website. You don't need them in front of you. You can just take the test somebody to be my guinea pig has already got a company in their mind that they'd really like to value. Anybody have a company in their mind that they'd really like to value, that they've chosen already? Who do you want? American Eagle. OK, now, what is it about the company that makes it interesting to you? I just asked my roommate. You asked your roommate for a company suggestion and you're very suggestible then to take. Can you get trade on the Russian exchange? Potentially. Lots of practical problems there. But you pick Gazprom because it's been in the news. Obviously, Russian companies collectively have collapsed in price. And you want to see whether it's cheap. So it's basically. Anybody else? Yes. Go ahead. Spotify. Spotify. Why? your valuation, many of you probably have already made up your mind on what you're going to find. It's the power of bias. It comes from lots of different things. One is, you know, it's almost subconscious if you think about where these biases form. It's not like you're sitting there saying, I'm going to be biased. It's everything you read, everything you listen to starts to affect how you think about a company. Anybody interested in valuing Tesla? So when you think about what it is that drives your biases, it's everything you've learned about the company, read about the company, think about the people running the company, even your experience with product. I mean, you value Uber and your one bad Uber ride in the next three weeks, God only knows where your valuation is going after that. And if you're paid to do valuation, don't even talk to me about being objective. are you going to be biased up or down? If you're valuing your own business, is your bias going to be to come up with a high number or a low number? Unless you have serious self-esteem problems, you're probably going to say, I'm a great founder, this is a great business. And how would that manifest? You're going to use higher growth rates and talk about value the company. If I valued at 200,000 and I give you 100,000, I get 50% of your company. But if you valued at a million and you claim the million, I get only 10%. So if I'm a venture capitalist, I'm pushing back against every one of your assumptions. You talk about high growth, I talk about low growth. You talk about big markets, I say the market's really small. he got divorced and when he got divorced his wife claimed half the business so he went to it was a privately held oil company and he self-appraised the company and he said i'm a terrible business person i've made terrible investment decision the company's worth nothing and you can see where he was coming from let's move on let's say that i own a business and the tax guy is after me research is structured, I've got to lay the foundation before I ask this question. There are two groups of people who do equity research. There are sell-side analysts and buy-side analysts. What's the difference between the two groups? What do sell-side analysts do as opposed to buy-side analysts? Anybody want to give it a shot? Go ahead. But there are far more buy side analysts than sell side analysts. And where do they work? Have any of you gone to the Fidelity building? Go ahead. You had your hand up or not? No, much more mutual funds and private equity is a part of it. But the bigger employers are people like Fidelity and T. Rowe Price. So they work for the fund. And when they do research, who uses it? bias, right? Because presumably you want to put buys and sells. But think through what happens when you put a buy recommendation. Everybody's happy. Who's everybody? The company's happy. The investment bank you work for is happy because they're banking business with the company. Your friends are all happy because they think and you put out a sell recommendation, you've just burnt the company that might be the source of any marginal information you get. So you're going to think twice, three times, seven times, nine times before you put a sell recommendation. You know how this manifests itself? to sell rather than say the word sell they'll say we've lowered the recommendation from a strong buy to a weak buy i've never i wonder how do you weekly buy a stock right you get on your online brokerage account and instead of hitting a key decisively maybe you just tentatively do it right maybe the money goes out slower and the stocks come in slower but if you're a sell side analyst Come back with the judgment on Spotify. There are two judgments you can make, right? Buy or sell. It's undervalued. Which one do you think is going to make him? Remember, he already owns a million shares of Spotify. Which one affirms that he's a great portfolio manager? The buy recommendation, right? Because if you say sell, he's going to say, you're right. I asked you for your objective opinion. By the way, you're fired. say your portfolio manager is one of those people who shorted Tesla. Tesla earnings report comes out this evening. I've kind of held off on the valuation because I want to get that final piece of the puzzle in. Let's say you conclude that Tesla is actually undervalued at $140 per share. Your portfolio manager is not going to be happy. The reality is when you look at valuations, when you value the target company, is your bias to push the number up or push the number down? What do you have to say? Think about your job. Your job as the banker is to convince the shareholders, the acquiring company that when they do this merger, it's good for them, right? With that lead in, you want to come up with a high number for the target company or a low number, which will make your shareholders feel, Oh, this is a good merger. they meet out? Or do they get paid based on whether the deal gets done? They get paid whether the deal gets done, right? Now, if you're the target company bank, you don't want to come up with a high value and show them the price is low because then you're telling them that they're getting a bad deal because they're getting paid less. So you got to convince your shareholders that they're actually, let's play it out. You're the M&A banker or the acquiring firm in a hostile acquisition. Here, you've got to be careful, right? Hostile acquisition, remember, the target company is fighting you. So if you come in with what you did in the friendly merger and show that the value is higher than the price, you're giving to give your managers ammunition to fight off the acquisition. So you're going to come. So it's almost a reverse of what you saw in the previous case. You convince your shareholders, look, this is too low a price. You can't take it. In most valuations, this is something we're going to talk about today. The number gets set first, the valuation follows, and you can see why. So one thing I would like you to do, drink and what your GPA is. And by the way, before I even do the research, this is what I expect to find. You think that's absurd. You haven't done the study yet. And then you do the study and you come up with the results and you show both. You show your priors and what you discovered in the study. You know why you do that? Because people your company, but it's good optional. So if you feel so comfortable that you can start on May 7th and finish by May 8th, all the more power to you. But if you feel to pick a non-U.S. company, which has a listing in the U.S., I'm okay with that. So if you want to pick Alibaba or Baidu, you got three of the constraints met. In fact, one of the ways you can play this out is, you know, there'll be people who try to join your group. And if you want towards the end, you can extract the pricing and say, okay, you want to join the group. You got to pick a money losing high growth, emerging market service company and get them to do the whole thing. Right. But that's just a suggestion. Don't take that as a rule. can't split the grade. So you have an incentive to make sure other people in your group are kind of keeping up. Why? Because I can't do it. I mean, 350 people in the class, I can't keep track of who's doing. So you have to have your internal mechanisms for keeping people on track. And if you have any, if you want any ideas, I second part of the class, remember I talked about pricing being different from valuation. I'm going to ask you to price your company. So you can actually cross the word out values, really price your company relative to other companies in the group. So if you're looking at a software different numbers for your company. You think, so what? Because the last phase, I'm going to ask you to tell me whether you'll buy or sell the stock. No strong buys, no semi-strong buys, no weak buys. Buy or sell. And I'll let some of you chicken out. You know what the chicken out is? I'll hold, which basically means I can't back 30 years so you can see how this is so from the peak of the dot-com boom to 2008 let's see where you fall in that larger spectrum so this is actually the time frame so if you're wondering what that's kind of confusing because as i said my mba class starts next week and they have two sessions less so i've listed out by session what you should where you should be on the project this is what i'm going to prod you with every thursday remember i said i'll send you an email to look shell-shocked. It's not that bad. If your reaction is, I don't think I can do it, trust me, you will. You've never taken finance, not a problem, you will. You will be able to do it. That's my job, to make sure you have the tools to do it. Which brings me to the start of the lecture. do it because they get paid. But if you ask them, why is Tesla trading at 140? Their answer is because that's what people think it's worth. If that's what I thought, I wouldn't be teaching this class. So I'm going to start by telling you why I do valuation. I do valuation to fight the lemming in me. You've heard of lemmings? Lemmings became famous or infamous in the 1950s when National Geographic or Disney, people are not sure which one did this, in the shoes of the very last lemming in the group. I know lemmings don't wear shoes, but kind of hang in there with the analogy anyway. You're running as fast as you can towards a cliff. You've seen your entire tribe disappear off the cliff. You're with me so far? I would think you'd have second thoughts about what you were just planning to do. Your left brain, right brain, whatever parts are actually say, stop, stop, stop. And then you hear this voice in the back of your head. And you know what it's saying? and I bent every assumption. I mean, it's almost like every lever is at full throttle. And I came up with 550 and I said, I give up. I can't get above this. But before I gave up, I heard this voice in the back of my head. You know what I'm saying, right? They must know something that you don't. Speaks in a monotone, don't ask me why. But when you hear those words, magical things start to happen to your valuation. Your growth rates go up, your discount rates go down, your cash flows get bigger. I call proud lemmings. I'm a lemming and I'm proud to be a lemming. They call themselves momentum investors, but you know what they do, right? What do momentum investors do? They look for a crowd, they join in. You're buying, I'm buying too. Why are you buying? I don't care. I can't even imagine going around shaking people saying I'm a momentum investor. I'm a lemming and I'm proud to be a lemming. The second group of lemmings I smarter than the average lemming you might be i'm not you know what i cannot tell i cannot tell where the cliff is coming i like that stanley drunkenmiller quote where he said i thought it was the board at the top of the air when in fact i was at the bottom of the the cash flows. I don't do valuation to make myself rational. It's an impossible quest. You know why? Because I'm a human being. Human beings are incapable of being rational. I do valuation because it slows'm working only with numbers. That's a misconception. Here's the reality. There are no objective valuations. We started this class with bias. Bias permeates valuations, whether you like it or not. I'll my very first one was on a Lotus spreadsheet, shows you how old that, because 1986 when they were in public. And you could dig through the numbers looking for clues, but if you really want to know why I found Microsoft to be overvalued, all you need to do is make that trip all the way up to the ninth floor to my office. You walk in, here's what you're going to see. You're going to see my, let me be specific. I'm not talking Anakin Skywalker. Cute little boy, Darth Vader. I'm talking episodes four, five, and six. The guy in black never takes a shower, I think. Speaks in that strange voice. I have lots of bad thoughts about Bill Gates. They have nothing to do with vaccines, incidentally. But every time I sat down to value Microsoft, if you've been on my blog i valued apple every year since 2009 take a look at my very first valuation of apple i think i spent half the post telling people don't trust me don't trust me i love this company too much and that's all i can do i can't say look i'm being objective i'm going to set that to the side and i've discovered that if you're open about your biases it actually And you tell how much you get paid and who pays you. I'll tell you which direction the bias is and how much the bias is. I'll give you an example, a company called Lynn Cable. 30 years ago, it was a small cable company and AT&T had this option to buy 51% of Lynn Cable at an appraised value. That's the way the contract was actually written. Lynn Cable is actually a publicly traded company, but the contract was written in terms of an appraised value. which side came back with the $105 and which one came back with the $155? Anyone who wanted to take a wild guess? Yeah. And Morgan Stanley came back with a $105 because your job is to work for the buyer. You come in with a low ball number. And of course there'll be a 500 page valuation report to back it up, to make it look like it's objective. And you came back with a $155 because your job is to come in with a high number. So what's the safest place for you to be? 130, right? They came back with $127.53. I'm going to give you some advice on valuation. If you're ever asked to value something, never, ever, ever, ever come back with a nice round number. Don't tell me the target price is $40 per share. Tell me it's you're saying but wouldn't it be unethical you know what human beings are capable of deluding themselves that they're objective no matter how biased they are so as i said we need to do some bayesian valuation we need to be more open about our biases it doesn't make our valuations less in fact i think we'll get a better valuations if everybody said look i have a bias i'm going to tell will get the right answer. And if you got the wrong answer, you must have done something wrong. That's a misconception. Here's the truth. There are no precise valuations. Why? Because you don't know what the future will deliver. I mean, imagine valuing a hotel March of 2019, two companies went public. They're both companies whose name started with an L. And they're both companies you're probably familiar with. One was a company called Lyft. Remember, Lyft got to the market before Uber. It was the first ride-sharing company to go public. your back if you're wearing Levi's jeans. They still make 70% of money from the jeans. You know their business model, you know their geographies, you know the company, a lot of history, a lot of crutches. Lyft is going to be more difficult. Why? Because you're trying to make a judgment on whether that potential payoff is money, whether they can convert themselves into a money-making company. You're going to make a lot of judgments., you can get a 10-year-old, you give me enough candy, I can treat the 10-year-old enough valuation to be able to value Levi's Shards. You can use my app to value Levi's Shards. It does a pretty good job. There is no differential advantage you bring to the table. In contrast with Lyft, you know what most people end up doing? And I'm going to talk about in the context of young companies. They give up. I mean, whenever I teach this class, especially for the MBAs, midway through the semester, I'll get somebody, usually a recovering engineer come in, he's done evaluation, put the valuation on my desk and he said, I'm done with my valuation. Can you tell me whether I got the right answer? I push the valuation back across the desk and I make a confession. Look, I don't know what the right answer is, I can never, ever conclusively be wrong. Think about it. It's one of the great things about equities. I value a company. I ask you to buy the company. Five years in, you've lost half your money. You come and say, why did you ask me to buy the company? time. Accuracy means you're trying to get the right number, even if it means that you're off by more. That's the end game evaluation. Which brings me a third and last misconception. If I make my model bigger, it's going to get better. And this is such an easy trap to fall into. It's so easy to build big models now, right? because I could never get the line straight. But it's a blank sheet of paper. And I used a pencil. I learned very early, don't use a pencil. Because if you screw up, you're going to be scratching things up. And a calculator. Not a slide rule. I'm not that old, but a calculator. When you do evaluation on a ledger sheet with a pencil and a calculator, you're not going to have desk. From this point on, value companies using our in-house model. Two things happen to these models. One is what I call input fatigue. I'll describe what input fatigue feels like. And some of you might have worked as interns in an investment bank, might have felt remember, you know, you want a job, you need to get paid. So you sit down with your in-house model, which has 85 inputs to value one company. And you start entering inputs, and you're really careful. Each input at a time, you get to the 15th input, and the clock strikes midnight. You're not Cinderella. You wish you were. The pumpkin outside, fairy godmother, maybe that would help. You look down, there are 70 more inputs to go. Your stomach drops. items. It's not because they know more about the company because then they can hide some really crappy inputs because you're never checking. It's input fatigue. The second is the power shifts with these models. You know what I mean by that? Initially, you think you're running the model, but somewhere along the way it looks like the model has started running you. And now with chat GPT, who knows? It might actually be running you. your valuations. Not because I don't trust you on Excel, but I don't want this to become an Excel class. My models are pretty straightforward. They're flexible. You can adapt them. You can modify them on one condition. Here are the words I don't want to see in your final report. That the modern model value the company added. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can download my model, but then take ownership. Adapt it if you want. Models don't value companies, you and I do. So here's how the email will start. Professor deodorant. It's amazing what Microsoft spellcheck does to your name, but if you're not careful deodorant, please I smell good, it could be a lot worse, right? I've spent the last six months of my life building this model to value cash, which my response is what an empty life you must have. Could you please take a look at the attached spreadsheet and tell me whether I is paying off big time. And you come up with a 10% cost of capital for Google. And then you discount the 4.8% guaranteed income you're making on the cash at a 10% Because the urge to add detail is always going to be there. So are you bringing something? So if you're valuing Peloton, you want to break the revenues down to subscription revenues and to fitness equipment revenues, all the more power to you. But if you do that, you better have something you're bringing to those estimates that allows you to differentiate between the two. Less is more. And it's something you're going to see me repeat over and over again, It's because you're getting more down. And guess what? People think we move from bad times to good times in terms of valuation. Do you think bias is less now than it was 30 years ago? I don't think I used to get paid. Uncertainty is actually greater because one of the flip sides of disruption is businesses that we thought were predictable and you can make up the estimates have become unpredictable. And it's so much easier to make your models complex. for similar things. You guys ever use StubHub or SeatGeek? How do you decide how much to pay? You look at what people are charging. You look at a section and say, wait, you know what? I want to be in that section at Yankee Stadium. No, I'm going to go. In fact, I think SeatGeek is the one that actually ranks your deals from best deal to worst deal. There must be a guy there. No, they just compare prices in a section and say, this is the lowest price, this is the highest price. That's pricing. that markets make mistakes. I'm often asked at the start of these classes, I'm surprised nobody's asked me it, do I think markets are efficient? Which my response is, if I thought markets were efficient, why would I be teaching this class? Because if we lived in an efficient market, what's the right value for Tesla? Just open up the newspaper or go online. What's the price now? That becomes your best estimate. In an efficient market, So let's start this process by looking at the most common way of doing intrinsic valuation, which is to do discounted cash flow valuation. What is discounted cash flow valuation? I don't know when you took your first finance class, but remember that first session for the class? It used to be that we made you buy a financial calculator before you took the class. You know why we did that, right? traders. Who the heck cares? There's no such thing as value. It's demand and supply. It's price. And if you believe that, then intrinsic valuation doesn't make sense. I think it's akin to the search for the Holy Grail. are you making assumptions about markets absolutely first you're assuming that markets make mistakes what's an easy one because even believers in efficient markets will accept markets make mistakes second you're assuming you can find those mistakes with your discounted cash flow models right and there you're on dangerous ground because the history of people who claim to find market mistakes is not that good remind me again how much the average active portfolio manager I want to give my money to Citadel. But in discounted cash flow valuation, you're making an assumption you can find those mistakes. So markets make mistakes. You can find those mistakes. But there's a third assumption you need for you to actually make money. So let's say, let's name the mistake. Let's say Tesla should really be at $200. You've done your valuation. You think that's a fair value. It's trading at 140. So you go buy a million shares of Tesla at 140. do we take a big position in a stock? I'm sorry, I didn't mind. So we are making assumptions about how markets make mistakes. So let's think about what the advantages are of intrinsic valuation. And we'll start thinking about why everybody might not want to use it when you talk about it. The first advantage is it puts into practice what Warren Buffett often says about his investments. has actually said is, look, I don't need the market to come around to my point of view. I'll just collect the cash flows. That takes a lot of courage. Most portfolio managers can't do that because you're going to have to cash out. What are the disadvantages? It is more work than pricing. It does require that you get your hands around cash flows. It does require that you make your best estimates. And there's one final problem, which is when you do an intrinsic valuation,",
