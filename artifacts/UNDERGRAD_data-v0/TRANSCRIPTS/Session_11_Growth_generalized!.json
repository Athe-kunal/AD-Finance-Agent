So here's the sequence of what's going to happen. In about two or three minutes, and then I will start on your quizzes. But when the quizzes are done, you will get an email from me saying, and it's probably going to be sooner than you think, that the quizzes are done. Come and pick them up. You think where? It'll be on the ninth floor for KMAC. It'll be face down in alphabetical order. That's why I made you write your name on the back. If you did not, not the end of the world. I hope you wrote your name at least one place on the quiz. Because in algebra, you can have only one unknown email when I tell you the quizzes are done. I will also send you the solution to the quiz with a grading template because I start grading. I'll have a template. It's going to be pretty transparent about where you lost points. If you did lose points, please check your quiz because I have in the next 500 quizzes that I'll be assume that you get no credit for any mistake. You'll be convinced that all of you are going to get zeros. And the next thing I know, you're going to freak out between today and tomorrow. So the solutions won't be ready until your quiz is also ready. So you can see what you actually got. So with that long lead in, let's continue with what we were talking about, which is growth rates. So in the last session, we talked about sustainable growth. But if your return on capital is changing, you're going to have a second component on your growth. Think of what? Let's assume you have a company with a return on capital right now of 10%. It reinvests nothing. Its reinvestment rate is zero. If I use the sustainable growth equation, your reinvestment rate is zero. What should your growth rate be? Zero, right? But let's say this company is able to improve its return on capital from 10% to 15%. It's reinvestment, low return on capital, actually be able to grow at a higher rate because it's improving its return on capital. Thank God for that. Because if you have a company with a low return on capital, you're going to feel doomed, right? Because you take a low return on capital, any sustainable growth equation on that low return on capital is going to give you a low growth rate. The Adani Group's return on capital is 3.6%. How fast can you grow But the way they get there is very different. The first company has a reinvestment rate of, so you can see different combinations of reinvestment rate and return on capital and different returns on invested capital. So I want you to think about which of these companies has the least valuable growth. In fact, it can be value destroying growth. Which of these companies has the worst growth rate? Even though the growth rate looks the same, which one is going to generate the growth? Because the more you're reinvesting to get that same growth rate, the less valuable you become as a company. So value of growth essentially comes from how much you reinvest, how well you reinvest, and're going to talk about, hey, how do we get revenue growth rates? Why 10% as opposed to 30%? But that's going to be the driver of growth in your company's revenue growth. So you've got to take into account how big your company is, how big the market is. Your story will drive that growth. So that's a revenue growth rate. Second stop, you've got to take a look at the margins. Are the margins going to rise over time, drop over time? What are you going to look at? I challenge you to find me any non-financial service company where you can't capture its business model with those three questions. Let's take each one separately. Let's say you have a company and I ask you, what's your revenue growth rate? Do you want to give me a high number or a low number if it's your company? You want a high number, right? So if I left each variable, I want you to think, the business you're in. So let's take each of these numbers and talk a little bit about some of the things you're going to focus on to decide whether to give your company a high growth rate or low growth rate. So let's take revenue growth. The first and biggest issue you've got to wrestle with when you think about revenue growth is how big is the market that I'm going after? This is in was Uber was changing behavior to the point that people who would not use car service would use car service for things they didn't need. My youngest son was on my credit card for a long time with Uber. And on Saturday nights, I'd get like seven Uber charges. companies have learned from Uber. So essentially now when companies come out with their estimates of total addressable market, they balloon out the market. Uber, when they went public in 2019, in their IPO, said that total addressable market was $5.2 trillion. You know how they came up with the $5.2 trillion? They took what people were spending on buying cars. Airbnb is going to draw people into the hospitality business who might not have gone, but it's not going to make the market five times. There's a lot of gaming in total markets, and you can see why. You're not in Silicon Valley selling a business. You're trying to value business. You have to be realistic. So if you see estimates of total addressable market for your company, it's your job to ask, does that make sense? But you're going to start with it. If you want to invest in the UK, you're going to go through a US media because people in the UK didn't watch. You know how Google and Facebook changed that? If you Google or Facebook, you're not constrained by geography. You essentially can go out and appeal to the entire market. And that's essentially changed the advertising business. Google and Facebook together control about 60% of all of the online advertising business. And that's happening in market after market. somebody else what do i do differently so those that combination is what's going to tell you whether your company can end up with a hundred billion in revenues in your 10 or a trillion dollars in revenues i know i've been sending you the valuation the week you have i think you've even stopped looking at them you should look at the star wars one though that was one of my favorite valuations of all time i did it right after i So it's essentially, but when you think about valuing a company, you've got to step back and say, hey, what is the business I'm going after? What is the market share that's going to tell you what kind of revenue growth to do? But take a look at my Tesla valuation, because I had to wrestle with these, right? What's a total addressable market? Presum's going to make a difference as to whether you get 60% market share, 40, no automobile company in history has ever had a market share that exceeds 20%. Why? Because there's so many different segments to the market, right? You've got mass automobiles, luxury. It's very difficult to be all things to all people. So Volkswagen and Toyota right now, about 10% market shares. market share in the market is pretty mature. But if you're valuing a company that's young, it's evolving, it's changing, it could be an Airbnb still, it could be a Peloton, you have to make some judgment. Peloton, the judgment you're making is what percentage of people are going to shift away from exercising in gyms to shift to exercising at home? What percentage of those people will want to spend the $2,000 or $4,000 it takes to buy a Peloton bike later on, I'll show you my Airbnb valuation. But when I valued Airbnb, I started by looking at the hotel business. Now, I learned my lessons from Uber saying, you know, you don't. But I wanted to start that because I need to know what people spend on hotels before I can make judgment calls on Airbnb. So what you see to the left is you basically see the size of the hotel business. In 2019, this is a year before Airbnb went public get a sense of the market and i would strongly suggest that that's where you start look at the existing business look at the players because you can try to get a sense of what drives this market so if you look at the the airbnb prospectus though they estimate their serviceable you know silicon valley loves to make up acronyms so that the which would then make higher revenues, therefore more feasible. So try your best. As I said, you're going to be wrong. But, you know, you have to make that judgment call on what the market is and what the extra unit you sell costs you almost nothing, you can have much higher margins than a business that has to spend a lot of money to generate the extra unit. I'm not trying to be mysterious, but how much does it cost Microsoft to sell an extra copy of, I mean, you can't even call it a copy. Everything is digital. You go on Microsoft and say, the car, no matter how efficient you are, will cost you money. The way this shows up is there's a number called gross margin. Gross margin is the difference between what you get on the extra unit. So if you look at your company's gross margin, if your gross margins are 70, 80, or 85 percent, your operating margins can be high. So even money losing companies, if they're in business with good unit economics, the gross margins will look great. Let's say you buy a Tesla. And I tell you, every year from now on, it'll cost you $2,000 to upgrade your software. Changes the model entirely, right? That is the story you will need to tell for Tesla to be worth what it is, is there's a side product they're selling where the unit economics are such Remember, we're talking about the market around the world. You're talking about Chinese consumers and Indian consumers paying $60,000. There is no way you're going to get a Ford. NIO is going to beat you every single time to selling the cars. What does that mean? There's a trade-off here. If you want to give your company high revenue growth, I will not contest you. But then if you also give them high operating margins, I'm going to ask you, well, how exactly is that happening? Which brings me to what I did for Airbnb. For Airbnb, the operating margin I had when I for that business. So you've got revenue growth, got a framework for thinking about margins. Let's bring in third input. And this is the input on which you're going to struggle with because when you look at it, sales to capital ratio. And here again, if you are a Tesla optimist, they've done some really good things. The sales to capital ratio for Tesla is about twice as high as the sales to capital ratio for a typical automobile company. the first Tesla plant. It produced about 50,000 GM cars. He made it produce 250,000 Tesla cars. So in a sense, he figured out a way to kind of take existing models and say, let's make them more efficient. So sales to capital ratio is essentially a measure of how efficiently can you generate revenue. So left to your own devices, you want to use a the first few years. You're able to grow with relatively little reinvestment. Your sales to capital ratio can be high for the next year, the next two years, the next five years, because you're living off excess capacity. Again, take a look at my Tesla valuation, because now you can look at it in fresh eyes and say, why did you use a five, a sales to capital ratio of five for the next five years? Because the Shanghai plant had just gone online and I did that valuation. It's only partially, but it takes about two to three years. So what will happen is you reinvest in year one, but your sales will not start to grow till year three. Or if you're a pharmaceutical company, any cash flows. Forget about seeing growth on those cash flows. So when you value the company, the three key inputs that drive your valuation are revenue growth. In fact, I've kind of concentrated the model and said, give me those three numbers, I'll value the company. At some level, it does simplify valuations. It's revenue growth, target margin, sales to capital. But remember, behind each of those numbers is an entire story you need to tell. to 200 billion. So it's feasible. It's a reach, but they can get that. I gave them margins of 25%. Why? They're an intermediary. So I gave them high margins. And to close the process, I need a sales to capital ratio. The sales to capital ratio I gave them was $2 of revenues for every dollar of capital invested. You often think of intermediary businesses as not capital intensive. I've heard people say, Uber can grow without rein takes 14% of whatever you paid. It used to be they collected from both sides, right? They collected from the host and they collected from the guest. They've changed their business model to collect it all from the host. Don't celebrate them because indirectly the host passes it on to you. But they did it because they don't want to deal with two people anymore. They wanted to make it one. I think it's about 14% now. And that's a key part of the model. yeah firm one so this company is basically running in place 10 return on capital is equal so the investments are doing nothing they're getting efficiency growth of eight percent but that's thing to do is project out five-year growth rates for each of these companies and company one you'll have 10 growth every year and company four you're going to have 10 growth in your one two percent in years two through five and company five you're going to have ten percent growth in the o1 and zero percent growth so that becomes the dividing line and what drives the value That's it. I think that's it. And AI is part of our future. That's why we're taking our energy. And that's what we're talking about. AI is the data. This is why we drive um",
