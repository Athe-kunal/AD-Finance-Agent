The equity risk premium you should demand for investing in some parts of the world are higher than the equity risk premium you should demand for investing in other parts. Everybody agree with that? and you get 90% of your revenues outside India, why should I treat you like Tata Motors, which might get 70% of its revenues in India, Tata Steel that might get 91% of its revenues in India. Risk comes from where you do business rather than where you're incorporated in trade. So I'm going to start at the class test. It's going to be focused on that risk and how do we measure that operating risk exposure? So let's set up the example. If an Israeli company headquartered in Tel Aviv much between it but if i have for instance a company in india that gets the bulk of its revenues in europe and north america should i be using risk premiums that reflect where it operates or where it's incorporated and then i'm going to kind of know as i said i'm not even going to ask you to pick because somewhere in the course of the day we're going to deal with this because you can see that not the logic of using operational risk premiums make sense but at the same time they're revenues and you could probably get away with it right because even though your engineers are in tel aviv if you really you know if if you felt that israel was too dangerous a place run your business you could put them all on a couple of planes send them to a different location your production is movable your revenue but let's change the facts let's suppose you're a nigerian oil company your headquartered in lagos all of your product but based on where you extract the oil aramco even though it's a global oil company is so closely tied to saudi arabian country risk that you don't know where the company stops and where the country begins it's going to be one of the valuations of the week i'll throw up is their original ipo valuation that i did because it's going to force you to It sells most of its stuff outside of there. Kind of mixed exposure, right? Part of it is where do you sell your stuff? The other part is your operations are not easily mobile. They're not as stuck as they are with natural. You could argue that I should look at both my revenues and where my production is. So practically, these are things you're going to face. So when you pick a company, I want you to think about where does the risk in this company come from? It's come from where I sell my stuff, where I make my stuff, Then we talked about the Indian rupee risk-free rate, and we said you can't use the government bond rate. You've got to clean up for the fact that there's default risk in there, and you took the default. So if you get a chance, watch the valuation tools webcast from last week, because I take you through the process of cleaning up those rates where you get those rates. Let's say you've done that, though. You've taken every currency in which there's a government bond. And I'll tell you up front, not all currencies are government bonds. Some of you already gave me this answer last session, but let's bring it to the surface. Why do risk-free rates vary across currencies? Notice I didn't ask you why do government bonds vary across currencies, because you can do dances about it's a risky government. No, let's say you cleaned up for risk. It's a true risk-free rate. Why do risk-free rates vary across currencies? Anybody want to give that a try? You want to try? Why do risk-free rates across currencies is inflation. High inflation currencies have high risk-free rates. Low inflation currencies have low risk-free rates. And deflationary currencies could have negative risk-free rates. to do your valuation. Tell me what's going to happen to your discount rates. They're all going to be high, right? So if you value a company in Zambia and Quacha, don't be surprised to see 25%, 27%, 28% discount rates. Same thing with Turkish Lira. You very quickly start to hit 25% discount rates. And it'll freak you out, especially if you're from a low interest rate environment. But then when you do your cash flows, remember they have to be in the same currency. The wind is now in your back, right? I still remember a student of this class from like 20 years ago, 25 years ago. He's now the CFO of a very large U.S. company. I won't name the company or the student because it might embarrass him. So he calls me a few years ago. And he clearly wants to crow about how much he remembers the class. He said, you know, I am the CFO of a company. rupee numbers and converted them into dollars. That's easy enough. Then he said, we estimated growth rate. I said, where do you get the growth rate? He said, we asked our Indian managers how quickly the company would grow. Let me ask you a question. If you ask an Indian analyst or an Indian manager about growth rates, what currency do they frame the growth rate in? Rupees, right? It's not that they're being deceptive. You think in the currency that you live in every day. So when you think about risk-free rates, think about inflation, because that is, in fact, the driving force. Now, a couple of years ago. OK, let's go there. Right. That's the other thing I could do. I could take the repeat cash flows and convert them into dollar cash flows using an expected exchange rate. Right. How do I get expected exchange rates? Remember purchasing power parity? Now, of course, when you do valuation, this is one of the few comfortable spaces, right? When you do a risk-free rate, this number doesn't change very much. And that's true if you're in the US or Europe. If you're in Turkey, forget about it. Your risk-free rate could shift on a daily basis. But one of the things we're taught is risk-free rates don't change very much in mature markets. Most of the time, that is true. But I'll take you back to 2020, and you come up with a value. You value the same company. Nothing changes about the company. Same cash flow, same growth rate. directly to Yahoo Finance, you can do that, where the T-bond rate gets updated automatically, those numbers will shift on you because that's the way the world works. Your cost of capital can change, your cost of equity can change, and complaining about it that it's changing can't change reality. So risk-free rates can change, risk-free rates differ because of inflation. Let's complete the risk-free rate process by currencies because of differences in inflation about seven years ago i had to value an egyptian bank i didn't have to but i wanted to and i valued in egyptian pounds because i wanted to deal with the local currency there was no government bond rate in egyptian pounds sure. Because in many government bonds, there is no trading. It's actually very, it's a rigid market. Banks are forced to buy the bond by the... So you see where I'm going? A government bond rate might sometimes give you a very misleading view of a risk-free rate if it's not trading. The Venezuelan government still insists The T-bond rate, take the TIPS rate, that difference is expected inflation. You don't need to have economists and macroeconomic analysis of the market-based number. That number is about 2.5% right now, long term. You're saying, how the heck am I going to get the rate in Egypt? You estimate it. You're saying, what if I'm wrong? It doesn't matter. Sounds like an absurd thing to say, right? Let's say the true inflation rate is 80%, but you estimate it at 15%. Final lucid. A year ago, if you were valuing a U.S. company in U.S. dollars, the T-bond rate was at one and a half percent. Historically, that's a low number. And the older you are, the lower it will look. You know what I mean by that? It's actually behavioral studies that show that what you think is normal. Is actually set between the ages of 30 and 35. something more normal. And as I said, that number can be three, four. And there's an entire group of appraisers who decided to go this route, not just last year, but over the last decade. They've been playing with normalized risk-free rates. In my view, you're playing with fire on a number you shouldn't be playing with. Let's play this out. Let's suppose you can do that. But don't normalize risk-free rates because you don't control that outcome. That's an actual opportunity cost. Today, that problem has gone away, right? Key bond rates are back closer to what people think of as normal, but this too shall pass. In two years from now, the rate might be seven do a tour of the Fed. Have you ever done it? It's actually, I wouldn't say fun, but it's not that bad, right? So you go to the Fed building, which is right, it's downtown. You go in and there's a tour guide who takes you around. The most exciting part of the whole tour is when you go down and you see the big stacks of currency. Don't try, don't get any strange ideas. Well protected. So I, but you're not going to get to a window and you're definitely not borrowing the Fed funds rate. It's a rate at which banks borrow overnight. Yet, of course, this has become mythology. The reason rates have been low for the last decade is because the Fed has kept them there. What do we say drives risk-free rates? Inflation. It's low. I'm not telling you the Fed doesn't affect rates, but the reason rates were low for the last decade is because you had low inflation and low real growth. And the Fed at the margin could affect it, but if inflation had been 5% for the last decade, nothing, no QE1, QE2, QE3, whatever you did, could have altered that reality. So when you think about interest rates, don't fall into the trap of assuming the Fed is going to raise rates this year lower. great rooster. And for a while, rooster rides high. Then one day, the rooster oversleeps. His iPhone didn't go off or whatever it was. He overslept. And guess what happened? The sun came up anyway. The other animal said, you're not making the sun come up. You happen to crow at the time the sun comes up. I think the same way. Japanese yen is a negative risk-free rate. It's had a negative risk-free rate now. It's actually, nominally it's positive, but because it's defaults, Japan is not AAA rate anymore, you end up with a negative risk-free rate. Now, part of the reason people aren't comfortable using negative risk-free rates, they say, if I use a negative risk-free rate, won't my cost of capital be low? Absolutely. You have to grow at 6% to show a 5% growth rate. So you're going to have to be conservative in your growth rates because that's what the inflation effect is going to be. And once you get to the terminal value, you talk about growth rate forever. I'm going to impose a rule that I'll come back and revisit. You should try to cap your growth rate at the risk-free rate. And people will complain. They say, negative growth. Well, you didn't complain when I gave you a negative risk-free rate and a low cost to capital, right? This goes back to the question of being internally consistent. buy equities today over and above the risk-free rate. Risk-free rate, T-bond rate right now is about 3.5%. When people are buying the S&P 500 or they're buying U.S. equities, they're obviously not settling for 3.5% as they're expected to, and they want to make more. How much more? That's what an equity risk premium captures. Already you can see that this number is going to reflect the risk aversion of investors. As people get more risk averse, the premiums are going to get larger. it meets our forward-looking and dynamic test. The way most people estimate equity risk premiums, most appraisers, most banks, is they look backwards. They look at the last 50 years, the last 80 years, last 100 years. They look at what would I have made investing in U.S. stocks, what would I have made investing in U.S. treasuries. They take that difference and they use that as their equity risk premium going forward.'re backward looking and assuming that the future will look not just like last year, but the last hundred years. You're on dangerous ground. It's backward looking, not forward looking. And is it dynamic? At the start of 2022, what's the average of the last hundred years going to look like? It's not going time, right? 94 years of history. The historical risk premium for stocks or bonds, let's say it's 5.06%, second decimal point. I must know a lot about risk premiums, right? But take a look at this number, 2.15%. That is the standard error in my estimate. So think about it. I'm telling you the risk premium is about 5% and recognize that this is not a fact so when people say i got the historical risk 5.31 percent ask them a question what's the standard error and say what's the standard error they've already lost the script right they think a historical number is a fact it's not and there's another problem the only market was in hindsight, do you see where this is going? If I build this in as my equity risk premium for the next hundred years, I'm assuming the markets I'm investing in are going to be the winners of the 21st century, and I have no idea. So we can play games with this number, but the reality is that the number, let's skip a page, that the historical premium to'm building off a shaky number, but I'll come back and replace that number. I'm going to start with the statement that I can't really do historical premiums for other markets. I have to estimate the risk premiums relative to the US. It's not because I'm being parochial. It's because that's the one market where I have enough data to actually start with the number. So let's assume you have a risk premium for the US. It could be historical. Sounded odd when I said that, right? Because you've got very different risk-free rates depending on which number. But I said, once you pick a number, when you get to the equity risk premium space, I'm going to ask you to use the same number. Whatever makes your risk-free rate higher is going to also make your equity risk premium slower or vice versa. The simplest way to think about an equity risk premium for a country, and this is the way investment banks estimate equity risk premium for other countries, the state of the art, if you can call it that, of getting risk premiums to other countries. And it's been around for 30 years. And when I first encountered it, I had a little bit of an issue with it. I said, I know default spreads measure risk, but they measure risk on a bond. This is equity, right? by 18, than US markets. So you multiply the 5.94% by that 1.67, your equity risk rate becomes 9.90%. So here you're avoiding the default spread entirely. lot of risk. When I estimate standard deviation, I'm estimating it based on the index level. But what causes index levels to move? In addition to changes in risk, somebody has to trade, right? If you have an illiquid market, let's take the extreme scenario. Let's say of a market where there's no trading at all. What's the index level going to be every day? It'll be exactly the same number. Illiquid markets are going to have low standard deviations. With Sorry. Sorry. Are the standard deviation in the Bovespa, just like it in the second approach, but instead of looking at the standard deviation, I'm sorry, standard deviation of the S&P 500, like the second approach. Let me back up. The standard deviation of the Bovespa, like the second approach, but instead of looking at the standard deviation of the S&P 500, I look at the standard deviation of the country, and then you bring in the standard deviations of equity and debt in that country. The advantage of that is one market is illiquid, the other one's going to be illiquid as well. So if there's hardly any trading in equities, there's going to be hardly any trading in the government bond as well. You don't get the mismatches, you get the second approach. Will the three approaches give you different numbers? Absolutely. How different depends on the point in time you do this. Can I see? I'll see the rating. It can range anywhere from AAA for Germany, Singapore, Netherlands, Australia, all the way down to Venezuela is what? Single C. I take the rating and I estimate the default spread. Remember the lookup table I showed you last session? So I have an equity risk for the US. I now have a default spread for each country. I want to go with the third approach. The third approach, though, I need a standard deviation in the government bond. 2% default spread. You multiply 2% by 1.41, you get 2.82%. You add that to the 5.94%. You get an equity risk premium of 8.77%. And I do this for every country. Take the rating, get the default spread, multiply by 1.41. Very mechanical. But by the time I'm done, I'm going to get an equity risk premium for every country that has a rating. There are 140 countries with ratings. market. So every AAA rated country in the world, you'd see 0% as the country's risk premium and 5.94% as the equity risk. But let's pick a part of the world. Let's take Asia, right? There's my breakdown of Asia. And you can see that across Asia, there's only one country with a AAA rating, Singapore, and Singapore gets the same risk premium as the US. But if you go across the region, you can see that there are some countries with my website noticed a lot of Lithuanians coming in. Nothing against Lithuanians, but this is a small country. I was 11% of my traffic from Lithuania. And it turned out that the Lithuanian government had required people bidding for projects to use my country risk premiums to come up with discount rates. I remember getting an email from the New Zealand milk board. I didn't even know there was a milk board in business person whose business had been appraised for value for sale and the appraiser had used the risk premium for lebanon from my website to come up with a discount rate you can see even you know lebanon's you use a 30.63 percent risk premium it was lower then but it's still a pretty high number you're going to come up with a high discount rate doesn't matter what currency you do the valuation you're going to get a low value All I'm trying to say is there's no intellectual firepower behind these numbers. Essentially, I'm taking ratings, driving them through, and therein lies a weakness, right? I think I've systematically underestimated equity risk agreements in the Middle East. Why? You take Saudi Arabia. There's very little default risk in Saudi Arabia. Nobody lies away because they don't borrow money. They have enough oil cash to keep going. They don't have much in debt. And the first reaction is assessing hurdle rates, get your head out of the sand, get out of the country now. And I'm looking on your website for an equity risk premium and I can't find it. Why? And I told him, look, you know, you're not rated. You're not rated. I can't assess a default spread. And he wouldn't let go. He said, so what do you expect me to do? How do I come up with hurdle rates? And I said, you have a point. I'll try. that way and hire the safest. Switzerland was the safest country, I think, and the riskiest might have been Syria. I took those scores, and then I look for other countries with similar scores. If you take, for instance, Syria, I know their political risk score. I find three other countries which have similar scores, and two of them are rated. I took that rating. So it's cheating. I'm basically taking other countries with similar risk scores is people can go from low to high, economists goes from high to low. So the highest scores are the safest countries. The lowest scores are the riskiest. So when you see low scores, you're going to see high risk premiums go with that score. When you see low scores, you're going to see high risk premiums go with it, right? So if you, but you can get mismatches my end game is to argue that your risk premium should reflect where you do business. Now, of course, the easiest way to measure where you do business is revenue. And for 80% of the companies I value, I do use revenue weights. Not because I wanted to. I had no choice. It didn't break down. No. Some companies do break down things like EBITDA or operating income. But I'll tell you why I often pick revenues over those. First, revenues can never be negative. And that's a good thing. You see why? If I use EBITDA or EBIT and one part of the world has losses, how do I come up with a weighting mechanism? Do I give a negative weight to Latin America because you're losing money? It doesn't quite work that way, right? you know what emea stands for basically they include africa and the middle east i mean they put it all into one basket so what the heck are you guys doing why what what do i do with this basket you will see and u.s companies have another problem if you look at the revenue breakdown will be revenues in the u.s revenues in the rest of the world come on guys the rest of the world is a really big place can you start to get risk premium you know how I come up with that regional equity risk premium I take a weighted average of every country in the region why not a simple average because you take Asia I don't want to weight Vietnam and China equally obviously if you tell me you're in Asia you're far more likely to get your revenues from China than Vietnam so what these are are weighted averages weights based on GDP get their natural resources, where they extract the oil. And all companies are actually pretty good. They will tell you where they're, as an example of this, you know, you take Royal Dutch. So in 2015 or 16, I valued the company. They told you where they get their oil and gas. And I took a weighted average based on where they get their oil. So in pure consumer product companies like Coca-Cola, revenue weights work fine. company doesn't come from where it's incorporated and traded, but from where it does business. Then we can debate, how do we measure that exposure? Should we use revenue? Should we use operating income? Should we use EBITDA? I'm open to suggestions, but I think that is a healthy debate. It's a debate we should be having about how do we capture operating risk exposure. So, your question? Yeah. Go ahead. but there is a danger of using revenues, right? Which is your exposure might come from your factories being in a country. And if your country shuts down, you won't be able to use it. No. And the question also that you have to face is, what do I do with this equity risk premium for my company? Should I assume it's a constant? So if you tell me you're in countries, it's 3%-ish. Or should I scale it up if you're in a risky business? In other words, do you get a double whammy if you're a risky business in a risky country? Do you see why? a more refined measure of country risk, where I look past revenues, I look past earnings, I look at everything the companies do. And I'll give you the roots of this approach. It was about 20 years ago, I was flying to Brazil to do a valuation seminar. And at that time, I was doing what other people did, which is treat all Brazilian companies as equally exposed to Brazilian country risk. I decided to give the measure a name. I called it Lambda. Why? Because I've decided attaching a Greek alphabet to things gives it this layer of sophistication that makes it... estimating what are the things you would look at to estimate Lambda. So you start with things like where are your revenues, where's your production, what risk management products do you use? But also things like, are you a company that the government views as being in the national interest? If you are, your Lambda just went up, right? Because the minute you get tagged as a company in the national interest, there is going to be a government effect. You're going to be more exposed to that country. revenues in India 2009. So here's a simplistic estimate of lambda. For Tata Motors I'm going to take the 91% and divide by 80% I come up with the lambda 1.14. It's more exposed than the typical Indian company because at least in 2008- 9 it was getting more of its revenues from India than a typical Indian company. You know that number changed it next year right? What did Tata Motors do in I use this only as an exception. For most companies, I do what I showed you with Coca-Cola. I take a weighted average. I wash my hands off. I move on. I have bigger fish to fry. But if you gave me a company with a single country where exposure to that country, you want to get a much clearer sense of what that exposure is, then maybe a Lambda approach is worth exploring. But it's going to take more work, more data to get there because you're trying to make it richer. took returns on your stock and ran a regression against returns on a country bond. Do you see what I'm capturing? Why do country bond returns switch? Because country risk goes up and down, country bonds go reflected, right? So if you have a company that's very exposed to country risk, you should expect its returns to be very sensitive to what's happening in the country bond. So I ran a regression and, you know, this was a mess Let's make this now, you know, take the Adani valuation. This is a company, for better or worse, and I will leave you thinking about this page. 2004, let's suppose I want to estimate a cost of equity for Embraer. I'll give you five different ways I can estimate the cost of equity, and they're going to give me very different numbers, but two of the numbers are going to deviate from the other three, and I want you to think about what I'm assuming in it's a Lambda approach or the weighted revenue approach. The two approaches where I get much higher numbers are approaches where I treat it as a Brazilian company. So the big decision I have to make here is, should I look at Embraer as a Brazilian company or should I look at where its risk is coming from? Because that're going to be given this high cost of equity and a low value, right? So here's my final question. Let's assume that you believe that risk comes from where you do business, not from where you're incorporated. That's what you think should be priced in. Let's assume markets disagree with you. They're pricing things in based on where a company is located. I have a question about what kinds of companies are going to be undervalued by the market The rest of the is meltdown, but Embraer is able to report earnings no matter what. It's the reality that stares you in the face, but you have no idea when that reality check will come. I think the way emerging market companies are valued and priced often reflects a very misplaced sense of risk coming from where you're in corporate and trade. The flip side of that, there's a lot of U.S. companies that are really emerging market companies.", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 84.67], "text": ". I think it's a great question.
