{"text": " um okay Okay. So. My wife teaches first, fifth grade. She used to teach second grade. And what, right? But every time I do this, I did this, my MBAs, they're grownups, that extra two minutes, I think is going to make use a first in first out policy when it comes to grading so i will grade the corporate finance class first and then the mba undergrad so i'm not picking on you because you're undergraduate you're one of those hundred who hasn't turned in your dcf for feedback i know i told you by this weekend do it regulatory capital? So if you're an undercapital demand deposits, you're paying nothing on the deposits. So it's like free money, and you lend it out, you know, you're making money. But let's say you're in a world where that's getting more and more am i keeping my money in the bank and making zero percent so it made that easy source of money making difficult so let's turn to the loan side credit companies and lend at 11%, I might be charging too low rate. And if I've saved companies, so when you look at banks, you're looking at not just what are you charging an interest, but how well are you assessing default risk in your companies and making sure you earn a rate of return higher than what you need. So a good bank tries to get a lot of deposits at low rates and tries to make loans at rates that are higher than what you should really be charging them on 1960s and 70s or prior to the 1980s, only big companies issued corporate bonds. Only investment grade companies issued corporate bonds. Mike Milken and Drexel Byrne have changed the dynamics of the second one. You could be a double B rate company and issue bonds and small companies and mid-sized companies. You see how banks are getting squeezed. On the one hand, the deposit business is getting more difficult because these money market funds and the Merrill Lynch's of the world are charges. And now you have in the last decade a new charge. I mean, every bank has some easy money they make. I talked about how J.P. Morgan charges me $45 for moving my money from my bank account to my bank account in J.P. Morgan. So why are you doing that? Because we can. And banks do all these things where you, they nickel and dime you, but the nickels and dimes add up to lots of dollars. is essentially getting squeezed. It doesn't mean it's a bad business. But these crises sometimes obscure. So the good times and bad times obscure the fact that banking as a business is getting more difficult. So banking is one kind of financial service business. Let's take insurance companies. What makes an insurance company a good insurance company, a great insurance company, an average one? What are the things you would look at? So how do insurance companies make money? Essentially, to insure ships. Those days, you think about big business in England, a ship owner would buy a ship and he'd send it off to get spices in the Far East. And remember, this was when you had to go around the Horn of Africa so to get from... So half the ships didn't make it. They were either destroyed in storms or pirates took them. Huge amount of risk. And the insurance business was born to kind of protect against it. They charged hefty premiums, company. Let's take a classic payment processing company. Payment processing companies are, let's go old-fashioned, MasterCard, Visa. How does that business model work? How do they make money? First is, every time a transaction happens on their platform, they take a slice of it. When you use a MasterCard to pay for dinner and you pay $100, $96 rather than $97.50. And he says, I don't want that. But they're credit card companies, right? So what's their second business? They give you a $20 minimum payback. You have a $2,000 credit card thing. So basically, they're loaning you $1,000. That's very nice of them, right? But how much do you pay on your credit card? You don't even want to look. It's like what? They do constrain them. So, when you think about financial service companies, one thing I would suggest you do is step back and say, how does this financial service company make money? And when you want to build a valuation, you've got to build it around those metrics. So, I'm going to take an example of a financial service company, very different from Deutsche Bank. It's a company called Paytm. goes on the platform called gross merchandising value. It's GMV, but it's just a fancy buzzword for how much do people spend on your platform. So MasterCard is GMV. And remember, the gross merchandise value is not your revenue. It's the 3% or 2% or 1.5% you make. And Paytm had some eye-popping numbers when it went public. The most eye-popping number at Paytm I downloaded their app onto my phone. I regretted it every second afterwards. I mean, this is an Indian payment process. Every day I would get 12 more notifications on three things they were going to give me. But I kept it on because I wanted to see how much their model was driven by trying to get new users, trying to get free stuff. And the way this shows up is you look at their take rate, it's 0.79%. That's minuscule. Remember what I said, incredibly mercantile, but that's the whole point of having users in your platform. That was a fatal mistake, because it turns out that the people running this business are incapable of building a business. You think, how did they get a company to build a company? They're great at attracting users, and for a decade, they were rewarded for that basis, right? In what way? Venture capital is paid based on how many users you had. So they were encouraged to build business models, where you got to The Indian government started its own online money transferring system called UTI, which is free. Essentially, it means that some of the easy money is gone, so it's going to keep the take rates lower. But 2%, even though it's much lower than the U.S., I thought was a reachable take rate. You know what the stock is trading at now? I valued it at 2,190 rupees. It's trading at about 600 rupees per share. that these are user builders, not business builders. And I could say the same thing about half the tech companies that came out of nowhere last year, over the last decade. Because venture capitalists rewarded companies for doing what? Scale up. I remember when the first bird bikes showed up, the ones that you rent for an hour off. We know where you are. And they say, you think you're special? I showed them my iPhone. There are 27 apps tracking me right now. Check your phone. There are probably at least 20 apps. You know why you let them track you, right? Because if you let them track you, it makes your life easier. make money? Do so. Yeah. Well, that's because if your margins improve from 0.7, your take rate goes from 0.75 to 2%, you're going to get a huge marginal return in investment capital because the jump in earnings is coming from margins improving. So any of your value companies where your margins improve over time, when you look at the return intangible because in accounting the word intangible is created so you can have two sets of rules, tangible assets and tangible assets. Step back. In intrinsic valuation, what drives the value of an asset? Cash flows, growth, and risk, right? Does it matter if it's physical assets or... No, we don't care. If I have a patent to get this fixed? I had to capitalize the R&D. It's not that it's difficult value, but the raw data you're given now requires work. Same thing when I ask you what's the value of growth. If I don't correct for R&D capitalization, I get this incredibly high return on capital, not because you take great projects, but because I haven't brought your biggest assets in the books. what effect that kept no all i do is move things around right i change my earnings i change my reinvestment when i capitalize r&d the effect is not on the free cash flow to the firm it's in my perception of the quality of the company's project the return on capital the reinvestment so i'm going to take a company and i'm going to take you through the process of what happens when i capitalize r&d in fact those of you capitalize r&d on my spreadsheet Then I checked off that box for R&D. I entered the R&D numbers for Amgen, and it had consequences. First, my operating income jumped from 5.07 billion to 7.3 billion. Why? Because I've capitalized R&D. It changed my operating income. My invested capital jumped by 8 billion because now I'm bringing in all that capitalized R&D. actually dropped from 40 to 30. So what am I learning about Amgen and Merck when I do these valuations? Am I learning anything about the quality of R&D investments in these two companies? Let me make some judgments here. I mean, is R&D good for a company or bad for a company? Depends, right? Depends on what? Depends on like any other investment. Does it increase earnings? In the case of Amgen, you know what's happening. create value can destroy value. Capitalizing R&D is going to give you. So try that out with any of you who've used R&D, capitalized R&D, turn it off, see what happens to your value per share. You're getting a very quick indicator of whether R&D is value creating or value destroying. I gave them 10 years. And remember, this is cumulative R&D. At some point you got to say, the definition of insanity is you keep doing the same thing over and over, they were up 40%. Between 2021 and 2022, they were down 15%. You do the same thing with Royal Dutch and ExxonMobil. These are mature companies. Why is that? It's oil prices, right? It's not that Aramco produces more oil or less oil. Same thing with cyclical companies. You take a mature cyclical company, you look at a recession, their earnings are going to collapse, not because of bad companies, but because of cyclical. Every question I ask So maybe this is one of those scenarios you might say, look, I use a finite period. That's why Farah Ramko used a 50-year life and didn't have a term with that. But here's the first obvious conclusion, which is with these companies, the story you tell has a very strong macro component, right? So when you look at Royal Dutch or Exxon Mobil or any oil company, the story is a big macro component. It's lurking in the background. if you think it's a ladder you know what i'm going to ask you to do stop valuing companies if you're that good at forecasting oil prices what should you do instead what's an easier way to make money go buy oil futures if you're a really great macro forecaster why are you wasting your time valuing individual companies just go do some forecasting the my advice is do your valuation with a macro neutral view. Don't bring in a view. Give me a value of the company. You're telling me, is this company good or bad? Then give me a macro forecast because then I can decide whether to buy oil futures or an oil ETF. Separate the two because you mix them up. I don't know where one stops and the other begins. And this is one of the few places or one of the places where I think 2016, I did a valuation of Royal Dutch for the Royal Dutch Finance Group in Houston. Now, remember what I said to value a company, you want to be macro neutral. What does that mean? When I value an oil company, I don't want to make assumptions about where oil prices go. So I'm going to use today's oil prices. I can use oil futures prices, their market prices. But remember, oil futures prices are not predicted prices because arbitrage binds them to the spot price. You know what I mean by that? No? trailing 12-month numbers, right? If oil prices average $70 over the last 12 months, and I take the trailing 12-month numbers, and the oil price now is $40, I'm almost guaranteed to overvalue the company. Why? Because I've taken numbers that reflect the $70 oil price, and I replaced it, I put it into a valuation with the oil price as $40. Is there a way I could estimate how much revenue Royal Dutch would have if oil price was $40? First, give me direction. 96% of the variation in Royal Dutch's revenues on a year-to-year basis comes from the oil price. I remember asking the finance group at Royal Dutch, or they asked me, they said, do you know who the CEO of Royal Dutch is? And I said, I don't know, and I don't care. What's he going to do anyway? Come look at the oil price terminal a little more carefully? This is an oil, in fact, you could, what the exploration is. What's the oil price? So I built a distribution of oil price, which is easy to do. It's a trade. And then I ran a simulation. What do you do in a simulation? You go pick a price out of the distribution. Let's say the first price you pick is $55. You value Royal Dutch with a $55 price. You come up with a value probably much higher than the $39 I got. And I do this over and over again. price of Royal Dutch was $42 per share. Take a look at the distribution. What does it tell me? $42 puts me at roughly the 62nd percentile. So what can I say? There's a 62% chance that Royal Dutch is overvalued, 38% chance it's undervalued. Think of how much richer your decision-making is. Instead of just giving you a value, I gave you a distribution of that. So if you want to try it out, I mean, it's free. You might as well try it out because once you", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 12.0], "text": " um"}, {"timestamp": [17.2, 89.65], "text": " okay Okay.
