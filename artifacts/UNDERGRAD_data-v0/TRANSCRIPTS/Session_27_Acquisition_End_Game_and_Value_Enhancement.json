I'm okay because I move around but that's the rule rather than the exception in Times Square. This guy with the unkempt hair, and every time you walk by, you'd have a Bible and say, end is near, repent, repent. I feel like doing that with each of you. The end is near, repent, repent. No, but I think you're ready for the end. So the end is coming, right? you're a verbose person, you want to explain to me every single detail of your discounted cash flow valuation. Here's what's not going to work. We say, look, this is how I got my beta. I started with the unlevered beta. Then I look for the debt to equity ratio. Then I multiply. I know how to get to a levered beta. I will assume you know as well. So here's my suggestion. If you want to summarize your discounted cash flow valuation, I know different reports have done it differently. picture and you shrink it to a quarter of a page, I will see there's something there. But beyond that, I'll not know what's in it. So if you take a picture, at least make it fill a page so I can see what you've assumed. So it's going to save you for your discounted cash flow evaluation. That's effectively your DCF. That's your page. I don't want your worksheets. I don't need your worksheets. I don't want to see your worksheets. I don't want five attached worksheets or spreadsheets. So basically don't send me the spreadsheets. I have i was trying to sell you a company that was worth only 60 million trying to get you paid more than 60 million you're being very resistant i tried to get you use your cost of equity and saying that pushes up value and said no then i tried to convince you that you had a lot of cheap debt and end consulting, it's really about going into companies and trying to convince them that they want that these are the things you do to enhance value. But I want to draw a contrast between value enhancement and price enhancement. And given the discussion we've had about value and price well that'll always happen right but so why is that good or bad i thought that was bad right to have more shares outstanding by itself it's usually viewed as a bad thing to have more shares what is it's a signal. A company that expected stock price to decrease in the future, at least that's the way your story plays in your head, is not going to split its stock. So you're saying, you know, stock split means that they're optimistic about the future. Will it have a value effect? Let's suppose the company you pick amortizes $2 billion in Goodwill tomorrow. Does it change your value for sure? Yes. Unless you read that and say, oh my God, I thought this company was a great acquiring company. But remember, accountants are reflecting mistakes that everybody knows you made two, three years ago. writing goodwill but it's a useless exercise don't tell that so you go to work for deloitte and they put you in charge don't tell your managing director why we're doing this useless exercise it's paying your salary just do the useless exercise move on but remember nobody cares okay what about changing depreciation you know what when you change depreciation methods it can affect your income especially if you go from accelerated depreciation methods, my earnings per share pops 7 cents, there's going to be some lazy trader out there saying, this is an amazing company, I'm going to buy 10,000 more shares of it. It's a pricing effect. You know what tracking stock is? Very common, the late 90s, New York Times did it. They took a segment of the company, it stayed part of the New York Times, but they allowed people to buy shares in that segment. You're saying, why would you? You're going to see that it can be a pricing effect. Having a different name for a company can have a pricing effect. So one of the things we're going to start with a question. So when CEO says, I want to enhance my company's value, I'm going to stop and say, are you sure you want to enhance your company's value? Or do you want to enhance your company's price? I'm done, go for it, because I'm just waiting for you on the other side. Which looks like the outlier D, right? Looks like a terrible business. And what are we taught in business school? Get rid of the terrible business, right? What is the effect of divesting a business? So think about the value of your equity as a company. When you divest something, what is the effect on your value of a divestiture? What happens when you divest something? price is much higher than the value. You know what kinds of, which divisions are going to be most likely to be those businesses that get too high a price? It's your best businesses. It's the businesses where you have the most potential, where there's the greatest growth. It's counterintuitive because that's not what companies do. But maybe after a new CEO comes in, rather than get rid of your worst businesses, you'd be trying to sell your best businesses return $45 billion in buybacks. Will you, as a shareholder in Google, be better off or worse off when it returns that cash? What does that depend on? The value of cash is cash, right? Unless what? You don't trust the management of the company. So in 2015, the question is, do you trust Google's management? The answer would probably have been almost universal. that Google has done outside of the search box has made the money. In 2015, people said, it's coming any day. It's coming any day. At some point in time, they said, maybe it's not coming. And on top of that, they've completely screwed up for whatever reason, at least from the outside, this AI thing, right? They've let Microsoft become somehow the winner of this game. It's using your cost of equity and you said no. Then I tried to convince you that if you use debt, the cheap debt and debt capacity and your cost of capital go down, you said no. Try to add 20% premium for control and you said no. Then it's synergy and you said no, there's no synergy. So now I'm getting desperate. So here I said, look, let's forget this intrinsic value stuff. It's not working for us. You want to acquire a company, you got to pay a reasonable price. I'm going to make it five times future ebit as if that makes the problem go away but the big number is five right which i got from looking at a pure group of transaction multiples hold on to the thought you're saying what's wrong with pricing nothing wrong but the question you gotta ask is, right? But what's a one cardinal what they think about the monarchy. What do you think the answer is going to be? If you pick the people who watch eight hours of the coronation and say, what do you think of British royalty? This is the most amazing thing to ever walk the face of the earth. 99% approval. Why? Because you've got a sampling bias. I don't think any of the people in this room, if you're the exception, don't put up your hand. I don't think you want to self-re up. If you use debt to do an acquisition, your earnings per share will go up. So you're telling me any debt-driven acquisition of a company with a lower PE ratio than mine is a good deal?IT doesn't make it okay for you to pay it and moving it to your five or your ten doesn't make the sin go away. And remove the words accretive and dilutive. There's no indication you're going to get by looking at the deals accretion or dilution to get a sense of it's a good deal or not. So at this stage, I've hit a dead end, right? You're not refusing to pay a premium. I've tried everything I can. So I hit you with what I think is my trump card. I can make is there are other companies in this business who are doing deals. And if you don't do deals, they're called defensive deals. Everybody else is doing a deal. If you don't do a deal, you're going to fall behind. Everybody's buying an AI product. I mean, banks, this is a big deal. Everybody's investing in fintech. You've got to invest too, even though you're overpaying by massive amounts. So is that justification? The think you can do things you really cannot do. These are the people in high school who really used to piss you off, right? They knew very little, but they acted like they knew it all. These are the people who will rise up the ranks to become driven so what do you do if you have an overconfident ceo try to sell them as much stuff as possible soothe his ego be like the japanese i'm nothing you're everything so to negotiate it's amazing right japanese basically i i didn't you are so great it's a great strategy because it feeds into the ego i am so great i can pay 80 premiums you collect the premium and then you go back home and you tell your wife look that stupid guy you told him he was the greatest yeah i there shouldn't be which is one reason i will avoid anybody who has sustainability in their name or any class with the word sustainability as part of its title sustainable what i know it's a big word now in businesses everybody wants to be sustainable i understand sustainability at the planet level right we want what does it meanages, right? But it's a company that grew with Silicon Valley. And what was its primary product through its glory years? What made HP a great company? What did it make? That's in the down days. Printers are when they hit the dead end. They made computers. They made computers more, Later, they'd write off $8 billion. So they did this over and over again. And this was actually an acquisition they did of a company called Autonomy. It's a British software services company. HP actually paid $11.1 billion for the company. And I wanted to see where that $11.1 billion. So I built up to that value. I started with the book equity of the company, which is accounting numbers, we know. synergy and control and they paid the premium. Acquisition gets done. At the time that they did this, everyone else in the business was flabbergasted at how much they paid. They thought they'd paid too much. So Leo Apotheker was the CEO of HP, New York Equity Research Conference, is asked to defend it. I'm going to read what he the journalist to show you that they know nothing about DCF decides to fill in the rest. It's a reference to discounted cash flow valuations. The journalist expanding our D.C. Look, I know what D and C and F stand for. Good. A standard valuation methodology. And here's Leo again. And we try to take a very conservative view. Leo should have stopped right there because he kept going.3 billion. It was an $8.8 billion mistake. And I decided when you make an $8.8 billion mistake, I want to hold people accountable. So I'm going to take the $8.8 billion and I'm going to assign blame to different groups. The first group I'm going to blame are the people who actually did the deal. That big merger expectation. So Leo Potheker's about 1.7 billion, and I'd like to get that money back from Deloitte. Because they were the ones who did the accounting games. So Deloitte's going to pay me 1.7 billion. Goldman's going to pay me about a billion. Or pay not me, but the shareholders in HP. And finally, I also said, you know what, the remaining they actually took the Autonomy and made it a worse forecast and claims made at the time of the deal. So lots of negative stuff in acquisitions, right? So you think, is there any hope? I have to go work in M&A, you know, it sounds like, you know, I'm going to go work in hell and you probably are, but I'll give you a few cool spaces in hell, you know, when it gets really hard, you can go in there. So think of this as the hopeful end to this process. So with each one, I'm going to ask you, so your job, you work in M&A you know what's in there so you can say i can pay a premium for that you do we prefer to pay with cash or pay with shares it's a tough one what do you think should depend on well what do you think about your own shares as the acquiring company if you think of overpriced shares you'd like to pay with them right but here's a the gaming system that happens let's suppose you decide to pay with shares and i'm a target company shareholder i can observe what you did right you pick chairs Everybody's happy the day after. They do dances. They're good friends. It's like two separate entities continue to exist for five years because they have their own cultures. Daimler bought Chrysler. I remember thinking, how is this going to work? You have the quintessential German company buying a U.S. automobile. You can see the culture war coming. It took them five years to say this is, you know, like a wedding that should never have happened, a divorce that's long overdue. you tell it comes out of a paper. It's kind of a primitive chart, right? It looks like a pre-Excel chart. No colors, no, no, very difficult read, but no, it actually tells a story. It looks at two bidders in a bidding war. I'll tell you, I'll take the suspense out of the story. One of these guys wins the bidding war. One loses the bidding war, right? Your ego is really damaged. But what did you say? So the bidding war is you bid 70, I bid 75, you bid 80. It's like eBay, right? 85, then you bid 90, and I drop out. You won. You know what? When you win an auction, you should always have mixed feelings. Part of you says, I won. You know what the other part of you say? Why did everybody else look at you and laugh? it but better still if you're in a bidding war you know what you should do right just drop out let people fight against each other pay the high price there's no winning a bidding war if you think from the perspective of your shareholders this graph is kind of tough to read so let me go through why you have these four different colors so basically they're based on the size of the target firm so the blue are smallest companies relative to less than six percent of your value more attractive option with smaller deals. Why do you think that is? Remember the gaming problem, which you have a trillion dollar company. If you're a $10 billion company and a trillion dollar, $2 trillion company offers shares, you're not doing any gaming. You're small, they're big, you just take the shares. But if I'm a $100 billion company and I'm trying to buy you and you're a $100 billion company, now you worry more about is the share correctly priced? So the way I read this graph is if you're doing big deals, you even better than buying private businesses. It's buying divisions of public companies. Why do you think that works so well? Remember the example I showed you at the start, poor divisions? What are we all trained to do? Get rid of the worst business. At what price? It doesn't matter. Give it away for free. Ford in 2009 classified Jaguar Land Rover as their worst business. Finally, this is from a McKinsey study that looks at how often companies deliver on promise synergies. So let's start with cost synergies, right? There were 92 companies in their sample, and 61 of them delivered 100% or more of the cost synergies that were promised. So they didn't promise 50 million, they delivered 50 million, often more than that. That's a pretty high percentage of right? It's a narrow path. You've got to be disciplined. You've got to focus on small companies, private businesses. Make sure you pay a price that's less than the value. And perhaps you can succeed. grown its market cap from $4 billion to $400 billion just by doing acquisitions. Another company they picked. 90 through 99 grew 100 fold through acquisitions. We talked a little bit about it. Cisco, the company that grew with acquisitions. I mean, they did 15 acquisitions a year, and Harvard Business School wrote a case. This is how you can grow with acquisitions. And that's usually a death knell for a company when Harvard Business School writes a case about how well you're doing. Because they're almost like they got the timing exactly right. with organic investments. Talk about the Coca-Cola's of the world, the IBM's of the world in the last century. You can talk about the technology, Apple and Microsoft for the most part have gone through internal investments. Once in a while, they might do an acquisition. Microsoft did by LinkedIn in about 2013. But for the most part, great companies grow with organic growth, internal investments. Growth through acquisitions is an exception. So when a company says, we're growing with acquisitions, value. We talked about value enhancement versus price enhancement. I'm going to show you two of my favorite studies of all time. Kind of fun studies. First was done in the late 90s. And it looked, I think, at 64 companies that changed their name. And they changed their name in a very specific way. What was happening in the late 90s? All of God and AI. Breadsticks come. Artificial intelligence. Nobody has any idea what it means, but the AI alone might add a 20% premium. It makes no sense from a fundamental perspective, but the pricing can reflect it. You think, why don't we play this game? The only problem is if you play this game, what the market gives, the market takes away. Here's a second study. To change the value of a company, you have to change something that matters. And there are only four things that drive value of a company. Cash flows from existing assets. So maybe you can find a way to get more cash flows from existing assets. We'll talk about some of the most common. You can try to increase the value from growth by doing what? What are the two ways you can increase value from growth? One is if you're a high growth company that's reinvesting too little, you've done in business school is in one of those places, right? Your corporate strategy class is right there. Lengthen the growth. That's all I can think of, 10 to 15 years. That entire corporate strategy class, 10, 15, 12, plays out there. And finally, you can try to reduce your cost of capital. What's the first thing that comes to mind when I say reduce your cost of capital? Change the mix of debt and equity. But I'm going to give you three other ways in which you might be able to reduce your cost of capital that don't require you to change the mix of debt and equity. You're saying, why wouldn't somebody have done them already? Why does Aaron Hicks play for the Yankees? Don't follow baseball. You have no idea what I'm talking about. This guy, it's like 100. I mean, I could probably go out and hit 120, I think. I just close my eyes and swing. Because the guy who signed him is still the Yankee manager. Because it's well established in psychology that taking an action that it should be the objective of any business to maximize taxes paid to the government. I can see Bernie Sanders is already looking through the door saying, what is he saying again? No, right? But let me cover myself fully. Within the framework of the law, I want to minimize taxes paid, right? So what can I do to reduce myies, you want to transfer pricing? You know what transfer pricing is? People who work in it claim all kinds of noble intentions. The objective of transfer pricing is move your income from higher tax locales to lower tax localical. I don't listen to this. That's fine. I mean, but it happens all the time. There are thousands of people in transfer pricing trying to do that. So all you're trying to do is lower the T. By lowering the T, what do you do? You raise the after-tax operating income. You get a higher cash flow. Let's keep going. We know the math, right? You take every times one minus T plus depreciation minus capex minus change in working capital. Is there something you can do with depreciation? managing your working capital better means there's less of a drain in your cash flows. So this is your first stop as a CEO. Can I increase cash flows from existing assets? So think in terms of the life cycle. Where in the life cycle are your companies if your focus is on cash flows and existing assets? What kinds of companies will this be your central place to go to increase value? Young companies, mature companies, you're going to encourage them to reinvest more. Even if they earned less than 30%, it's still higher than your cost of capital. So one way you can get more value from growth is to try to get companies that should be reinvest history and across all their clients, we're going to go from very best way to grow to very worst way to grow. Let's start at the top. Looking has now become, right? So expand the existing market. Maintaining or growing share in a growing market. Why is that easy? Because the market itself is growing. It's more forgiving of your mistakes, right? to create value by competing for share in a stable market. How do you get a higher market share in a stable market? You cut prices. You get the higher market share, but at what expense? Much lower margins. The net effect can be negative as much as positive. You get the higher market share, but you get lower profits, lower value as a consequence. And at the very bottom of the barrel, by now you should know what's coming, right? We spent an entire hour and a half on it. It's good. It's good. 69.4% of companies globally last year earned less than their cost of capital. 31% earned more than their cost of capital. So it's more the rule than the exception that you have a tough time earning your cost of capital. You're saying that's because it was 2022. But corporate strategy is all about barriers to entry and competitive advantages, right? So as an outsider looking at potential competitive advantages, let's list some of those competitive advantages. First is branding. As we talked about, branding gives you the power to charge a higher price for the same product. If you're a company with a brand name, nurture it. Hold on to it because you don't want to let it go. If you're a company without a brand name, try to find a way to build a brand name. Works for about 20% of companies. it. But if you're a regulated monopoly, here it is. Everybody hated the old phone companies. So you got ready to charge 40% more, but there was a little bit of a roadblock, right? What did you have to do? You had to go in front of a regulatory commission that said this year it's 3%. This is not a combination. Everybody hates when you get a 3% price increase. I'd rather not be a regulated monopoly then. Give me competition every single day. So we're going to get legal protection You want to make the cost of switching into your product as low as possible. But once people switch in, you want to make the cost of switching out as high as possible. Jake, what's your phone service? AT&T, Verizon? I want you to stop by the AT&T store on 8th Street. Walk in and ask them, can I switch to AT&T? You'll have three salespeople surround you. 15 minutes later, you'll come out with an AT&T managers worked really hard, right? They got endowed an advantage. So sometimes cost advantages come from being in the right place at the right time. Sometimes cost advantages are earned. How did Walmart get a cost advantage of its competition with economies of scale? And I really mean that not as a buzzword, but it's really economies of scale. And if you have a cost advantage, there are one of two ways you can take advantage, right? or is in a business which has become commoditized, the semiconductor business, increasingly commoditized. How did Nvidia stand out? They decided to go after a segment of the business where they said, we're going to make it about high-end chips. And they bet right, because they caught the Bitcoin boom, and now they're hoping to catch the AI boom. This is where value enhancement can help think about how does it change the value. And finally, let's talk about cost of capital. You think about lowering cost of capital, are higher if you have a product which is less discretionary which is which is so if you can make your product less discretionary you're in effect lowering your beta and your cost of capital how do you do that now one way to think about advertising is what's our entire job of advertising you cannot live you're completely fine without it but they want to convince you cannot live without and if it works maybe this is how very well-run company. Already your task has become more difficult, right? It's more difficult if you have a badly run, it's easier if you have a badly run company. It's a well-run company, high margins. It's reinvesting about 57% of its after-tax operating income. So that's pretty active. And earning a great return on capital, 19.93%. So it's growing fast. It is a company though, that is funded almost entirely with equity because the founding thing and this is the subtext to that reinvestment return capital is they've historically at least in 2005 got right? You get to run the firm. You do things differently. That difference is the value of control. It was difficult here. Why? Because the company was well run. So I'll give you a contrast. This is 2003, a company called Blockbuster. Now, it's easy to laugh about Blockbuster now. There's nothing left of it. I think there's one Blockbuster store, mailed it back. I mean, you think how primitive we were all in a primitive time then. But essentially it was the alternative blockbuster, much cheaper. You didn't have the, remember blockbuster, 30% of the revenues came from late fees, which is you just forgot the tape. And my kids used to do it all the time. The tape would be under the bed. Nine days later, you discover it's not worth even returning it and just buy this damn tape. Netflix, you didn't have that. And the other was Walmart and the other company. you're hired a CEO of Blockbuster. What's the first thing you're going to do the day you walk into your office? First edict. Stop opening stores, right? In this case, reinvest. Get rid of that team that's in charge of finding the next store location. Just fire them right on the spot. There will be no more stores. In fact, if I drop the reinvestment rate to 0% here, all through time, your final projects, I'm going to bring this control question fully a full circle and talk about how it's useful in the context of hostile acquisitions, voting and non-voting shares, even rallying publicly traded companies with this chance of change. But make sure you get those numbers into the master list by Sunday, preferably by 10 o'clock. Give me a break. I need to pull those numbers, create the presentation. So give me at least a couple of hours to be able to do it. like in grading. So I didn't do as well as I'd like on the first year. I have been actually studying for the final year. Like if I were to do very well in the final, like would I, okay. Okay, so I would still have a chance of like doing well. Like the final you get up to, you know, sort of, what is there some mind-blowing how did you get in the game? So basically there's like, there's a kind of, you know, as well.
