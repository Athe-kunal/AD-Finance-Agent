  "text": " And then, we're going to have a few things that we can do to help help help the community to be more inclusive. And how we can use the same as we did in the past to help our community to be more inclusive. And I'm going to share a little bit of a story Thank you. since COVID people seem to assume that everything can be online. Now that's, you know, it'll be in person. I did send you three rooms because we look around you and this is not even the full room. If everybody were in this room and we were all doing the quiz, the stress level alone would blow the roof off. So there'll be three rooms and I've assigned you to a room. Why do you look at me like I have two heads? So you do, you got that right. So if, you know, make sure that you go to the right room, otherwise we'll get overcrowding in the rooms. So I thought Zoom would be more flexible for that. So, you know, if you're working from home, you have questions accumulated. I wanted to put it off as late as I could before the quiz, because there's no point having office hours before you're ready. So hopefully by then you can go through past quizzes, see questions that come up repeatedly and see if any of them need to be answered. Any questions about the quiz before we start? The first right? Which, which, which forced the website? That was the 2020 online, because when you took the quiz online, you could not do it except. So maybe that's a throwback in time. So it will be free. It will be open. So make sure you show your work and if you want to have scratch paper on the side you really don't need that much everything should fit on the quiz itself so you don't bring need to bring any exam books or something it'll be four pages each problem will have its own page and you can use the back of the page if you screw up and you want to cross out what you did hopefully that doesn't happen no so there should be plenty of room to show your work any other questions on the question every year for the next 10 years. I want you to guess what your revenues will look like 10 years from now with a 30% growth rate. Just give me your guidance. We talk about compounding. Will they be half a billion, one billion, two billion, three billion, or four billion? How many of you think we're going to end up at a half a billion if you let 20? Nobody, good, okay. How about a billion? In fact, if you did arithmetic growth, it should be around a billion, right? really large numbers. And you have to stop and ask, is my company's market big enough that I can have a $20 billion revenue? That's why I don't like to think in terms of growth rates. I like to think in terms of end revenues. So when you use that FCFF simple Ginseng spreadsheet, don't think of the growth rate. Look at the end revenues. Is my company capable of delivering those revenues? So that's one thing we'll talk about is growth rates and how they compound. If your margin is stable, projecting one will give you the other. If margins are changing, then you can keep moving up the income statement. When you look at growth rates as you move down the income statement, you're going to probably see growth rates be very different. In fact, when you look up growth rates for your company on Yahoo Finance or on Bloomberg, the growth rates you're usually getting are growth rates in earnings per share. Analysts don't project growth in revenues. Very few project growth in operating income. and it'll maintain its existing assets and its existing return on capital. I've kind of given away the problem. If you don't reinvest any money, and you're going to maintain your existing return on capital, what's your growth rate going to be? You maintain your existing return on capital. Your capital is not growing. You're not reinvesting. You're going to be stuck with a growth rate of zero. Or put differently, if you want to grow, what do you need to do? You either need to increase your invested capital by reinvesting more, know who that person is and I'd like to very much meet them one day. He's always on Zoom. Hopefully on Wednesday he will be up for the exam. I will talk to him directly. But remember the last session we ended by talking about free cash flow equity. Free cash flow equity, I said, is net income minus reinvestment minus or plus whatever you get of reinvestment and generally they can't afford to borrow money. There's no cash flows from debt. You're going to have negative free cash flow debt. VC is called this cash burn. It's a feature of young companies is you have cash burn. So let's say this company's business model starts to get traction. Its losses start to become profits, but it's still a high growth company. It still has a huge reinvestment need and that reinvestment. Your existing business are throwing off profits like crazy. You're going to have huge cash flows. This is peak free cash flow equity territory. And then you're going to decline and your free cash flow equity start to decline as well. But if you look at the pathway of net income the free cash flow equity. While you have a net loss, the free cash flow equity is even more negative, which makes sense, right? You have a net loss, you got reinvestment, you got negative free cash flow equity. In 2020, the net income turned positive for the first time. You're saying, what happened to the free cash flow equity? It seems to have disappeared. It actually was very close to zero. But remember, the net income turned positive, free cash flow equity did. to happen as an investor, but think of that as a steady state. One of the indicators I use to detect where a company is in the life cycle is I look at the net income and I look at the free cash flow equity. If the net income is running way ahead of the free cash flow equity, it's much higher, I think of it as more in its growth phase. Whether it's good growth or bad growth, I still have to make a judgment. If the numbers are starting to catch up, it's towards its mature phase. If the free cash flow equity starts to now 65% of all cash returned to shareholders takes a form of buybacks. at net income versus free cash flow equity? In a sense, in countries where you start to see growth start to become close to zero or negative, you'll start to see the cash return to investors start to exceed potential dividends. You're seeing that in the US. And it's not just now, it's been going on for quite a while. So any questions on free cash flow equity? of the 80% that comes from me for working capital. I have a shortcut to free cash flow equity. The reason this works is I'm implicitly assuming that any debt that gets repaid will get repaid with new debt that's raised. And that new debt will be taken on as I grow as a company, keeps my debt ratio stable. So when you think about free cash flow equity, again, remember it's a post-debt cash flow and how much you borrow can affect that free cash flow equity. Of $704 million. That year they paid out $345 million in dividends, showing that they held back on cash. I'm going to play a little game here, and you tell me what I'm missing. The debt ratio that you see of 24%, let's say I made it 30%, or 40%, or 50%. As I raise the debt ratio, what's going to happen to my free cash flow equity? So debt ratio goes from 24% to 40%. Remember, net income is still my net income. It's still there. free cash flow equity, doesn't this mean my equity should be worth more? What do I discount the free cash flow equity at? What's the discount rate I use? By now you should have done enough review on the quiz to get that right. Should I use the cost of equity or cost of capital? Cost of equity because it's free cash flow equity. And what's a key number that determines how high or how low the cost of equity is? It's not the risk-free rate and the equity risk. They have nothing to do with my that. If that is true, then what should happen? Every company should be at 99% debt. The second is increasing leverage will decrease value because the discount rate effects on D. And in fact, I put up my latest data update on debt. If you get a chance to review it, because it's a good review of your debt sessions from corporate finance, of how debt plays out in value. So let's talk about growth. I'm going to set the table for growth by first arguing against the notion that growth is always a good thing. Right now, how deeply entrenched that is. I mean, when have you heard a CNBC analyst get on and say, I really like this company because it has low growth or negative growth. Right. So at least if you listen to these people, they always think higher growth is better than lower growth and lower growth is better than negative growth. with growth. It's not adding or destroying value. And if you earn less than your cost of capital, you're actually destroying value as you grow. That's going to become the basis for this entire session on growth is to talk about good growth as opposed to bad growth rather than say any growth is good. Therefore, I'm going to go out and grow as a company. So let's look at the ways in which you can estimate growth for your company. By now, what growth rate to use for Meta. It takes the weight off your shoulders. It's not that their growth rate is better, but now you can blame them if something goes wrong. And in the context of valuation, there's actually a group out there that you think of as experts. Equity research analysts, that's all they do. They track these companies. They've given me a growth rate. I'm going to use that growth rate. I thought I was speaking in English, but I guess I wasn't, right? The conventional view of historical growth is that, you know, you're looking at the past, you're going to come up with a growth rate. So I'm going to start by looking at historical growth rates and why they're not as clean, clear cut as they look from the outside. So when you try to estimate the historical growth for your company, here are some of the choices you'll have to make. First is, are you going to compute an arithmetic average or a geometry average? Take a hotel company, you make 2020 as a space year, it's going to have 250% revenue growth since then. Why? Because all the hotels were closed. It's also going to depend on the metric you use to estimate the growth. Is it revenue? Is it operating income? Is it net income? Is it earnings? But you can get very different numbers. So growth rates you get can depend on the method you use to compute the growth rate, the time period, and the compounding effect. What happens if you're not careful about taking past growth rates and projecting them out of the future? So let's start with the first question. Arithmetic versus geometric averages. How much does it really matter? So this is a company called Motorola, a semiconductor company, late 90s. I estimated the growth rate in revenues EBITDA and EBIT. So basically, I took six years of numbers. This is almost always going to be true. And here's why they're diverging. Remember the two arithmetic and geometric averages will converge. Only one condition is met, which is the growth rate is the same every year. In other words, if there's no standard deviation in the growth rate, your arithmetic and geometric averages will be let's take that scenario where you go from negative to positive and talk about what does that tell us. Let's say you're looking at Time Warner in 1997. In 1996, they had negative earnings per share, minus five cents. In 1997, their earnings per share went to 25 cents. I just put it into my Excel and said, compute the percentage change. Here's what it did. you fix it. Rather than divide by last year's earnings per share, you divide by the higher of the two numbers. What a neat little trick. Now you've gone from minus 600% to plus 120% because the denominator will now be 25 cents. My bottom line, though, is none of these numbers really make sense in terms of forecasting future earnings per share. If you have earnings going from negative to positive, you story about future growth rates. One final point about historical growth. Be very careful, though, even if you feel sure about past growth, in extrapolating that growth into the future. Have you heard of Callaway Golf? 1997 was valuing the company in class. They had 122 million in net income up from 1.8 million five years before. So the compounded growth rate over that five-year period was 102%. It's not even arithmetic average, geometric average growth rate. Let's say 97, I look at the last five years and this is a great company. It's got 102% growth rate. I'm going to project 102% growth rate for the next five years. See what happens. for the next five years because your company might not. This is like the example we started the class with. Be careful about extrapolating past growth, even if you think it's a reliable number into the future because scaling up is hard to do. Is that a song? I think it's breaking up is hard to do, but somebody should sing a song, scaling, and they should play it out loud in every equity research, you know, office in the world because analysts constantly high growth rate they're not lying they're just delusional enough to believe their own stories but lots of appraisers we ask them where do your numbers come from they use management growth rates and in public companies you know you ask people where do you get the growth rate for your company the answer is they got it from equity research analysts because that information is actually public information you can get estimated growth for the next five years for your company you go on yahoo finance you can look up that this all their lives. They just track these companies. They must know more than I do. And a significant portion of every analyst's time is forecasting earnings per share. So their forecast of earnings per share must be much better than the forecast the rest of us make because of how much time and resources they bring to the game. So I'm going to start with that. We want to look at earnings forecast from analysts and which is next quarter's earnings, analysts are better than time series models, small blessing, but not by much. The way to think about this is if you get perfect forecast, you get a very low, your numbers. So if your forecast is always on a subset because, you know, you present this evidence and I have to equity research analyst conference. They all look at each other and say, well, that's not us. It's the guys outside the room. We're much better forecasters. You're focusing on all analysts and a lot of crappy analysts. None of them are at this conference. If you focus on the very best equity research analyst, you're a Joe Brown All-America equity researcher. That's how you introduce yourself to your spouse, to your children. You say, from now on, call me All-America because I'm an All-America analyst. Because it increases your income by millions of dollars once you become an All-America analyst. So these are the very best of the analysts, right? So there are studies that look at these All-America analysts and they ask a very simple question. give you 15 analysts and these are all people in the finance and you get to pick a name you're going to pick based on who you see on cnbc or who you see so the more visible you're as an equity research analyst the more likely it is that even if you're a terrible analyst if you get quoted all the time so the you're coming in They're actually getting better in terms of being closer to actual earnings. Yes. It's not even \u2013 that's a different issue, which is the price effect you have goes up. That effect you can explain by the fact that if you're an All-American Analyst, Wall Street Journal picks you up more often our inventories are running low. Read into it whatever you want. Your access to information magically becomes better when you become an all-American analyst. It's a fact that people think that you can be the conduit for revealing this information to the market. And it is true, and the point made about the price effect of your recommendations becomes much greater when you become an all-American analyst. But here again, there? Buy people, buy people, sell people, sell. So I'm not sure stickiness alone explains it. First, remember the numbers I gave you for buy versus sell? It used to be 20 to 1. It's now 9 to 1. So first is sell recommendations are red. The very fact that there's a problem, right? We're spending millions of dollars in sell-side equity research, but it's not credible. Nobody really cares what it is, and it doesn't seem to be having any impact is there's a whole lot of lemmingitis in sell-side equity research. You know, one of the things you'll notice with the sell-side equity research analysis, they'll revise earnings estimates upward if they think positive. You see one number. So in the Wall Street Journal, to do with equity research. If you think about equity research at its core, what are you supposed to do? You're supposed to ask deep questions of companies and be an objective assessor of what a company is worth. At some point, though, equity research analysts seem to forget that they're supposed to look at companies as objective outsiders. They become insiders. They become defenders of the company. Why? Because they play too much golf with the CEO. They get to know the manager. I mean, let's face it. If you get I put out the seller recommendation, the company, what will the rest of the investment bank think of me? Will I get a call from the CEO or a managing director saying, come in and talk to me? Because this is a company we're going to take public in six months. It's okay. In fact, last week, I was in my room doing a session for Google managers So if any of you are going to sell said equity research, this is a long fight to be fought. Initially, you're going to be put in a sector, you'll be asked to follow 15 or 20 companies. Try not to develop tunnel vision, keep your perspectives open, look at the rest of the market, buy this sector, sell this sector. So there's research at the sector level or even at the market level. We can sell entire geographies. Sell all Indian stocks, buy Chinese stocks. But at the individual sell-side equity research level, it's very difficult to put a sell recommendation. So I'll complete this section by stating three propositions about analyst growth. information. When there is private information, remember, it's coming from one source. It's coming from the company. You think so what? It's true. Company information is based on more basis. They know more about the company, but company information is by its very nature biased. It also explains why some analysts, like all American analysts, have an advantage over others. Why if you work at Goldman Sachs, you might have an advantage over somebody who works at Jefferies because example to illustrate this whole idea of sustainable growth. I'm going to start with a company that is a billion dollars invested in existing projects on which it's making a 12% return. So right now it's making $120 million in earnings. Let's assume this company goes out and invests in new projects, 100 million new projects on which it also makes a 12% return. It's mathematical. If you look at the return they're going to have after that investment, they're going to have 132 it reinvests, the reinvestment rate, and how well it reinvests. That's the core of sustainable growth, that ultimately growth comes from reinvesting more and reinvesting more. But once in a while, you can get growth without reinvesting, right? If I take the 12% return that I earned in the company and made it 13%, I make my existing assets more efficient, I'm going to get growth. I'm going to call that efficiency growth. We're going to be about how do you estimate what a company's reinvesting and how well it's reinvesting. So I'm going to go back. Yeah. When you say stimulated, tell me the mechanics. What does that mean? Revenues are going up because people are buying more of your product. Now, do you have to build capacity to build that product? I mean, what kind of business you're in, but it's easier in some business than others to get high growth. So let's talk about how we measure reinvestment and how we measure the quality of investment. And I'm going to go back to the three ways you can do valuation. You can focus on, if you think about it, you can focus on earnings to look at reinvestment as a percentage of after-tax operating income. So with each one, I'm looking at how much the company is putting back. I look at return on capital or return on invested capital. This is one of those things where you'll see multiple terms floating around, return on invested capital, return on capital employed, return. In my view, they're all the same. People dance all kinds of dances, acting like they're different, but ultimately you're measuring the same thing. You're looking at your after-tax operating income as a percentage of overall invested capital, which is book value equity plus book value of debt minus cash. I've said this before, but I'll re-emphasize, in 2007, 2008, I was looking at Wells Fargo. I wanted to get a growth in earnings per share. Growth in earnings per share, you measure what you reinvest with the retention ratio and how well you reinvest with the return equity. That equation though, puts a cap on your growth rate. What's the highest retention ratio can be? What's the lowest payout ratio you can have as a company? Zero, right? So the highest retention ratio you can have is 100%, which means your growth in the long term expected growth rate you would have for Wells Fargo, if they can sustain the return on equity and retention ratio they had last year, would be about 8% a year. This was June of 2008 when I did this. Then, of course, in September of 2008, we had the banking crisis, where effectively we all woke up to the reality that banks had overreached. It's so hard, though, to find that. There's another way you can end up with a high return equity. We're taking average projects. Real estate people do this all the time, which is you go out and borrow money at a rate lower than what you can make on your projects. And the more you borrow, we saw that This is actually a return equity calculation I did for a company that used to be called Brahma. It's now called Ambev. It's a Brazilian beverage company. And I did this in probably 97, the first time I went to Brazil, and I got a return equity of 31% for the company. And I was surprised it was so high. So I broke it down. net income. When you think about growth and non-cash net income, you've got to shift your focus away from retention ratios. You've got to actually look at what a company actually reinvests. And we know how to do that, right? After cash flows, it's capex minus depreciation, plus change in working capital. And if you're looking at equity reinvestment, the equity portion of that number. So I'm going to compute my rein you're abandoning the zero one constraints, you can have a negative equity reinvestment rate if you have a shrinking company, you can have equity reinvestment rate of 200, 300 or 400% if you have a company that's growing massively, you get much more flexible. And when you talk about return equity now you're focused only on the portion of your equity that's not invested in cash because you know exactly what you make on cash, the T-bill rate or commercial paper rate you're focusing on the rest of your equity. So that's only about 8% of the net income. You say, how quickly can a company with an 8% equity reinvestment rate grow? Well, the saving grace was the return on equity. If you look at non-cash return equity, it was 64%. There's a simple reason for that. Coca-Cola, about 40 years ago, spun off their bottling plants. The biggest part of Coca-Cola, the most capital intensive part were the bottling plants. They spun it off, made it a separate company. So those of you buying Coca-Cola shares, earnings per share to non-cash net income, you can see I'm trying to do the same thing. How much am I reinvesting? How well am I reinvesting? And try to bring them together. Last, and I'll end with this last example, because I know you're getting tired, is let's talk about reinvestment rates and returns on capital for the entire firm. So this was going back in time to Cisco's peak in 1999. Remember, I showed you how much they rein't that they were reinvesting less, but they were not reinvesting as productively as they were the previous decade. So when you think about sustainable growth, even if you never use it, it's healthy of that number, the numerator is an accounting number, operating income. The denominator is also an accounting number. It's book value. You're saying, so what? Everything accountants do that change those numbers are going to affect your return invested capital. I have a very long and a very boring paper that you should read only if you have trouble sleeping. I fell asleep multiple times while I was writing the paper. It was so They didn't really take a restructuring charge. You're saying, so what? When you take a restructuring charge, what happens to your book value? It's going to drop. Let's say it's two years later. You have a company that's taken terrible investments, but it's written off all of its mistakes. Two years later, when you compute the return on equity or return on invested capital for the company, you're going to get a really good looking number. scientists, so don't all come here because it's going to be too crowded..... That's why we can use the tips rate. No. Okay. All right, thank you. Thank you. Okay. This is actually. This is just first 15 minutes. So basically, not to calculate from laptops and calculators, how do you use a laptop? 25 minutes into the room. Smaller part. We all started at 3.30. At 4 o'clock. Time for everybody. People in the room. Remind them that there's class. After the quiz. They can come back down here. So I give them about five minutes to go down there. And you can come down here. After you have done this quiz. And even at the top. You can come down to the side. um but outside of that the questions are bigger in the years the partners could have wanted to play from the first thing we have now we should be getting most part of the end questions I'm down here. So comment about it. Hi, how are you? You're doing free cash flow. It's not supposed to. You decide to free cash flow.",
