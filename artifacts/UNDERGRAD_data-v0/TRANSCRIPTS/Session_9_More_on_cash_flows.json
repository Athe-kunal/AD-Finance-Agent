  "text": " folks we can turn your cameras on and make my life a lot easier to speak to faces rather than gray boxes so please do Thank you. and also you know it's um don't put off preparing for the quiz till next tuesday it'll be too late so in a sense it's best to get started over the weekend and you need to work work through past quizzes it's not just reviewing the slides and saying i kind of get it you need to actually work through the stuff one more thing about the quiz, you need to let me know before the quiz. So by 3.30 on next Wednesday, you need to let me know I'm not coming to the quiz because, and give me the reason. If you do miss the quiz, as you know, the 10% gets moved to the remaining quizzes in. So here's my question. One of the tactics you can use, and it's often the simplest tactic to deal with money losing companies, is to replace the loss with the average income over the last five years. So if you have a company that had a loss last year, but made profits in previous years, replacing, it's called normalizing. It's kind of a fancy word for you, back to what you used to do. The company has not scaled up or down in the last five years. Why does that matter? Because if a company gets bigger or smaller, using average earnings over a period can be a little misleading. Every single assumption in that list is being made by you. So before you just replace last year's number with an average of five years, be very careful because it might work for a few companies, but it doesn be growing at a pretty fast pace. And also, but the negative free cash flow equity also tells you something about what they will need to do in capital markets, right? That they will have to raise equity every year to cover that negative free cash flow equity. You discount those free cash flow equity back at the cost of You can see in the way they're investing. So you've been dependent on venture capitalists for your free cash flow equity. All of a sudden, the world has changed around you. Venture capitalists kind of pull back. It happened in 2001. It might happen again in 2023. Put simply, if that happens, you're never going to get to nirvana, which in your valuation is in your 10 with the big terminal value. So is it a safe assumption? that something could go wrong and you might not be able to raise that free cash flow equity. So today we'll talk about free cash flow equity because it does convey information to you about your valuation that you might find useful in valuing the company. So let? No? 75 million each year for the next three years. This guy is not exactly poverty stricken. Now, I'm not suggesting you'll have to value all necessary, but if you're valuing all necessary as a club, guess what? That three year contract is dead. depreciation. You correct for debt by capitalizing the leases and treating it as debt, and you also bring in an asset. So what you're effectively doing when you capitalize leasing is correcting for the accounting mistake that led to this flaw in the first place. Until 2019, I used to have to do this with every company that I valued. That's why it's built into your GINSU spreadsheet, is that lease conversion worksheet. Is every company 2007, accountant said, we need to be treating employee options as expenses, sensible thing to do. Because when you give employees options as part of compensation, it is an expense. I said, I cheered. I said, thank you for doing it. You know who pushed back against accountants? in the footnotes, I've been capitalizing leases as well to see how close I am to the, because we're both doing the same thing, right? We have the same lease commitments. We should converge on the same number. I was trying to see, am I coming in pretty close to what accountants are doing? In the US, I'm actually pretty close. I come up with a higher value. So my estimate of leases is always higher because I have no escape clauses. Again, let's look at what sectors you're most likely to see R&D as a big issue. So what I've done here is listed the rationale for why R&D is really capex. If you go back to my original definition of capex, my definition of capex is any expense that creates benefits over many years. Let me repeat that again. Capex is any expense that creates benefits over many years. That's why land is a capex, buildings are capex, machinery is capex. But let's do the test on R&D. the conference was held was in Vegas. Accountants in Vegas. Sounds to me like there's a contradiction. Why in Vegas? Because they have the biggest room. So there's a thousand CPAs in this room. And for whatever reason, they invited me to give their keynote. I don't think they're going to invite me back again because the title of my keynote is 10 things that accounting does that I don't quite get. And one of them happened to be leases. I said, what are you guys doing with leases? They fixed that. Anybody want to try? Go ahead, Yuki. Would it be like tax benefits? Would it be like what? I'm sorry. Sorry, I did it a little while ago. Would it be tax benefits? Benefits. So expand on it. So when you say, so give me the logic for it, why that would lead you to expand something. I was going to say that they're saying R&D is like, it's like an operating expense because it has to do with profitability. So like they have to expense it like an operating expense, like every year. That's a strange, what do you mean has to do with profitability? Everything has to do with cash in, cash out. You build land, you build a factory, it affects your profitability. You can't use that as your rule for capital, for deciding- Operating expense. Expense something, right? You don't take a land of building Use uncertainty as a dividing line. It makes no sense. So I said, that makes no sense. They said, no, no, that's not the reason. They're thinking on the spot. Thousand accountants haven't even thought about the reason for why they're expensing R&D. They said, we want to be conservative. We're accountants. You see how it's conservative, right? By expensing R&D, you're lowering earnings. They're saying, it's better to give you, we can debate whether conservative is a good way of judging earnings. not on the books, guess what your return on equity is going to look like? For a technology firm, it's going to be 85%, 90%. Even if your projects are average projects, you're going to report stupendously high accounting returns because your denominator doesn't reflect what you're investing in. That's not conservative to me. We cut to the chase. There's no good reason for why accountants are doing what they're doing. You're saying, why aren't they fixing it? R&D. Let me repeat the question again. On average, how long does it take between the time I do R&D and a commercial product emerges? See why I threw the on average up front? Because I know some R&D will not pay off. Some might pay off in two years, some in five, some in seven. Tell me on average, how long it takes. Four years? Okay, I'll take that. I'm going to go back and collect R&D expenses every year for the last four years. If four years is your life. And if I've been capitalizing R&D, in 10 years. I use 10 for pharma companies. Why? Because of the approval process go through. It's an incredibly long term. Software companies, I use two to three years, right? You turn things around much more quickly. So SAP, because it makes computer hardware somewhere in the middle. So I pick five years. I collected R&D expenses for the last five years, minus one, minus two, minus three, minus four, minus five of the last five years and the R&D expense in the most recent. show up and what is that? If R&D had been capitalized all the way through, I'd be amortizing it, right? The 903 million, which is the sum of the last column will become the amortization you see in the income statement this year. You say, what about this 2.9 billion, which is the second to last column? That will now show up in my balance sheet as an asset. That's the R&D expenses from previous years. It will also show up because balance sheets have to balance as an increase If R&D were capitalized, that tax deduction would be $903 million lower. So from a tax perspective, I'm worse off. And if that's the reason you're capitalizing, you're expensing R&D, then I understand what you're doing. Just don't be too open about it because the tax guy is going to come after you. So, again, let me look through, again, just like I did with leases. I'm going to trace out how this changes the numbers and valuation. after-tax operating income will increase by the difference between the R&D expense and the amortization expense of $117 million. So your earnings will be higher by $117 million. You have higher earnings. This is good, right? If I go to my balance sheet, you will now have a book equity that is higher than it was before. than the cost of capital to create value? My old calculation for the return on capital, I used the book value of equity I saw on the balance sheet, 3.768 value. With the 530 was earnings of technology companies and pharmaceutical companies. Microsoft, Apple, and Salesforce are actually much more profitable than you think they are looking at the accounting statements. You see why? Huge R&D expenses that are being expensed right away. You also are overstating the return on equity that's being treated as an operating expense, right? Can you think of analogous expenses? I think at the start of the class test last week, we saw some of them, right? Like an advertising company. What should now be treated like R&D, capitalized? Some of the advertising expense that builds up branding is really for the long-term, we should be doing this. A consulting firm, the recruiting and training expenses, categorizing expenses. So are there any questions on both the mechanics of what I do to capitalize R&D as well as the intuition behind why I think we should do this for any firm with R&D or R&D-like expenses? Okay. Built what to do about one-time items if they're truly one-time. And you'll see what I mean by truly one-time. Let's assume you have a company that's reporting a loss of a half a billion. Then let's say this is your company. It's a money-losing company, but it's losing it because it had a one-time charge of a billion for a strike Just take the item out and what you get as earnings will be the earnings that you use in your valuation. You now have a money-making company, you can do everything that your teammates do. But before you do that, there's one thing you should check. With S&P Capital IQ, which I think you now all should be able to access, you could pull up numbers for the last 20 years. And-time charge, I said, take it out. But if it's a once every five-year charge, then rather than take the whole thing out, what should you take out? If this were normalized, what would you have? $200 million as an expense every year, right? If they were doing the right thing. So you know what I'd suggest? Replace the $1 billion one-time charge questions on one time stuff. Jason, it looks like you have a question. Go ahead. I remembered like, like with lease operations, there's like some valuations to it. And there could be like, I think gains and losses on those, depending on like, like, how do you, how do you treat those? I need to pull up what operations I'm sorry, when you say these like a revaluation of like that's fine right because that's again because it cuts in both directions that's why i asked you if it's always negative then there's something systematic going on but to the extent that it cuts in both directions it's just an accounting see the minute accountants decided to capitalize things you know like branding and customer list this is a consequence of that right because when you capitalize things you got to go back and change uninformative as to what exactly they're doing. So I'm just going to look at the number average over time and just use it. But this is an interesting question. We're at the mercy of accountants, right? They can play games on us. And sometimes they can commit outright fraud. If you read my Adani group, you know, this is what, you know, the Hindenburg is claiming Adani. But let's say in your company, the accrual income is always higher than your cash income. your antenna should start quivering. In the US, you'll get 10Ks, but if you go and look at the SEC filings to your company, you'll also see for some companies restated 10Ks. Because when you restate your 10Ks, you have to refile with the SEC. You say, what's the big deal? Once in a while, if your company has to do it, you say, well, what's the big deal? But if your company has to do restatement year after year after year, hey, you should start to say, what's going on at this company? forensic accounting, I'll send you a couple of references in the email after class. Don't try to read them before the quiz. You don't need them for the quiz. This is for the rest of your life. But they're actually kind of fun books to read because the next, you will never read another financial statement the same way you did after you read these books, because it'll set off all these red flags that you keep watching for and accomplishing. I got that red flag. Maybe I should start worrying. But accounting fraud is a real and at the most recent, you might average out across the cycle, right? So 2020, they lost a lot of money. 2022, they made record profits. I'm not going to use either number. I'm going to look at an average between 2017 and 2022. So if you have a company, a commodity company, a cyclical company, where it's a cycle that's causing your losses, their plant and equipment to make it more efficient, they can do okay. Again, you're looking at a long-term solution. But be careful. It's got to be a structural problem that is fixable, right? Any of you valuing Bed Bath & Beyond? Let me ask you a question. Do you think Bed Bath & Beyond's problems are fixable? What exactly would the fix be? People are not coming concluding that. But you have to base it on a story and say, it's not just because it's losing money, but because I don't think that they can ever find a way to a profitable future. So that's really the template I want you to think about when you think about losing money. So when you see a company losing money, ask yourself, why is it losing money? Is it because of a one-time loss? Is it because of a macro factor? Is it because it's a a different space than what their original business proposition was in, how would you kind of approach that in terms of understanding margins? Well, first, the acquisition is done, right? Yes. So the margins today reflect the combined company's margins. Correct. So you're starting with numbers that already reflect the fact that acquisition has been But as this other business is enough growth, you can succeed. So one suggestion I would have is maybe look at the two line items separately, have different stories for each and different assumptions about growth and margins for each. And then see if the consolidated value is large enough to justify buying the shares today. Okay, got it. And I guess we don't have to worry about like organic versus inorganic growth in the sense that like- It takes care of itself, right? Those are tax rates you should use in your valuation. And this is actually one of the inputs in FCFF GINZU that I asked you about. Let's work out the intuition behind which tax rate to use. because if that were the answer, if F were the answer, what tax rate should you use in valuation? What's the easiest tax rate to work with? A zero tax rate, right? If all you have to do is be consistent, then just act like there's no taxes. So clearly F is not the answer. So really the question is effective tax rate or marginal tax rate. Work it through intuitively as to what it'll do to your valuation. that you pay 25% of your income in taxes. If you continue to pay only 16% of your income in taxes for the next five years, I've understated your value because I missed the fact that you figured out ways to save on taxes. So I don't want to go with the marginal tax rate all the way through because that's going to push me into doing some weird stuff. Could I use the effective tax rate of 16%? I could, but let's say can start with the 16% tax rate when you start your valuation. But as you go through time, year one, year two, year three, year four, year five, and you approach your terminal year, but it's jumping all over the place. It's like Jason talked about his company. I see companies with 16%, 27%, 23%. You throw up your hands and say, I'm just going to go with the marginal tax rate. That's why I give you that option in the FCFF GINSU for you to pick. It's not because I want to lead you down one path, but because I want you to make the choice for your company that reflects what you've learned about your company.'t get a tax taxation component in any of your classes, right? In your accounting, do you deal with taxes at all, other than to just talk about it as a side question? No, you don't really need any of your companies that are money losing companies, check the footnotes. And the nice things about having PDFs rather than physical copies is use the search box, type in NOL, net operating loss, try different things. Who knows what accountants are using to describe it there. They will tell you what accumulated losses they have from previous years. So when I valued Uber in 2019, this is a company that has a billion dollars in NOLs from previous years. It's expected to have half a billion in operating got an nol jason that's it for for companies operating in different regions for some of their reasons they are profiting so there's even though a company is like holistic money losing in one business or one region yeah you a valuation allowance and they were intentionally marking down their valuation allowance significantly. You know what? The red flags are going off for me. As you describe the things your companies are doing, I'm getting closer and closer to the forensic accounting stage of saying maybe we need to worry about. But sometimes companies, because of the way they've set up their subsidiaries, might not be able to offset it. And when you see things like this happen by design, you worry about opacity, you worry about control, you worry about who's running the company, what their incentives might be. I'm not saying that, you know, that this means your company is worth nothing. I'm saying that it might mean once you value the company, even if you find it slightly undervalued, you might hold off on pulling the trigger saying, you know what, I just don't trust these guys. They play too many accounting games. There's too much opacity in the income statement. In other words, if you want to give me a high growth story, you have to reinvest to create that growth rate. It's your story. So your net capex assumptions have to be tied to your growth assumptions. Everybody agree that that's common sense. So if you have a manufacturing firm, you tell me its revenues are going to quadruple over the next five years. It's got to build capacity. it's all CapEx to me. So in my story, it all swims together in CapEx. A company growing through acquisitions, I'm going to count acquisitions as part of CapEx. That said, though, I hate value companies that glory by doing acquisitions, Cisco. It's a company that grew from $4 billion to $400 billion over a 10-year period in market cap. And it did it by acquiring company after company. So in 1999. When I did the net capex for Cisco, I started with the accounting definition of capex and depreciation from the state and the cash flows. And if I just stopped there, it looked like Cisco was reinvesting nothing, 98 million. But the fact that they were doing it in R&D and acquisitions meant that it was happening under the radar. So when you look at your company, you will learn a great deal about your company and how it's growing if you start breaking out these items and seeing where it's coming from. And it'll help you tell a much better story when you value the company. So any questions on CapEx, acquisitions, R&D? Go on. assets. So it's not the increase of the workforce that matters. It's what kind of terms you've entered into. I mean, after all, Al Nasser, the Saudi soccer team increased its workforce by one by adding Ronaldo to its workforce. But by doing it, it probably doubled its debt overnight, right? Yeah. It was a huge capex. So it really depends and non-debt current liabilities. Let me explain what I'm doing here. Start with the current liabilities. When you look at the financial statements for a company and you look at the current liabilities, you're going to see lots of items, right? Inventory, accounts receivable. You're also going to see current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt. I'm saying those two items take out of current liabilities, treat them as debt when you run a small store. You turn and look at your storeroom and it's filled to the roof with inventory. You know why it should make you cringe? What is the problem with having that much inventory? Jake, what's the problem with having a lot of inventory? Like Peloton, you have to sell it. And if you don't sell it, you don't make any money. earning some 2% rate when the market rate was 7% or checking accounts with no interest on them. Amazing to think about, but when you have cash invested in a checking account, it's a wasting asset, right? Why is it wasting? Because while it's sitting in your checking account, it does nothing for you. If you take your money out of your checking account and put it into a money market account, earning 3.58%, roughly what money market accounts are making right now, close to the T-cash working capital. So as you think about working capital in your company, first, in most of your companies, it's a secondary issue. Unless you have a retail firm or a firm heavily dependent on working capital, this is what's not going to drive your cash flow. But for some of your companies, it is a key item. And there will be some companies, but this number can be negative. Non-cash current assets can actually be less than current liabilities. Amazon, for the first decade of its existence, had negative non-cash working capital. You know what they were doing? They were using supplier credit as a way to grow. Because the way Amazon worked early on was an online book retailer, right? So they would get books from a publisher, say we'll pay you in three months. calculation. Free cash flow to the firm is a pre-debt cash flow. Free cash flow to equity is the cash flows to equity investors. And for the longest time, if I was to estimate the free cash flow to equity, we took the easy way out. You know what I mean by the easy way out? Rather than estimating it, we looked at what companies paid as dividends and said, that's a free cash flow to equity. Implic for instance, pays no dividends. It has significant free cash flow equity. Use a dividend discount model for this company. You can understate the value. Some banks pay out more than their free cash flow equity. If you use a dividend discount model, you're going to overvalue the company. So what I'm arguing for is you can try the dividend discount model, which often we do for financial service companies. But if you have a company where you can estimate free cash flow equity, dividends. I've seen people actually discount earnings at companies and call them discounted cash flow models. Those are horrendous mixes. I don't even know what and what. Earnings are not potential dividends. So I'm going to argue that potential dividends are cash left in the till. So the way I want you to think about it, a look at each of those line items. Remember I said the statement of cash flows is where you should go? Every single item in that is in your statement of cash flows. Net income is where every statement of cash flows starts with, right? If you go to the top of the, so don't use the income statement, just go to the statement of cash flows. of cash flows. And remember, in the statement of cash flows, each item will already give you the sign of the cash flow, right? So next to capex, you'll see a minus, right? Because it's a cash outflow. So all you have to do is just sum up all of those numbers because the cash flow signs will take care of, is it a cash inflow or outflow? See what the potential dividend is. Now, final question. Let's say you do this for your company. You come up with a free cash flow burn. They get all upset about it. There's cash burn in the company. Hey, guess what? That's what you should expect to see in a growing company because when you're reinvesting large amounts, cash burn is exactly what you should see. So when we start in the next class, I'm going to start with the life cycle so you can see how free cash flows equity evolve across the life cycle.",
