  "text": " Sk\u00e5l! hey folks quick reminder if you need one and your quiz is wednesday i'm sorry i know of all the things You gotta leave my home for me. I don't have to open something. Whatever it is, come up with a better excuse. But today we're gonna talk about, before we do that, I want to do today, I used today's start of the class test to kind of wrap up the very last newsstand I've never gotten to in my life. Like the last four cases. I mean, think about what you talked about in private companies. We talked about the difficulties of a private to private over. So Deep is going to be the founder of the software company. Jake is going to be a VC. And Isha is going to be a public market investor. So Deep starts a business, lots of potential. And he thinks for the first few years, he can run the business with his own cap. First few years, you're going to be the owner of a market investment. Two years from now, you're expecting to invite Jake. So for the first two years, when he was running the company, what is he going to see as risk in the company? His correlation, the correlation with typical software companies and marketing is 25. He's completely undiversified. So it's a single beta one who's going to see a beta of four and his cost of equity is going to be 24%. Risk free rates are paid down to three. So for two years. Two years later, Jake comes into the company. makes valuation better than 90% in year one. Figure out how we discount cash flow. We take the free cash from the firm, we discount the, in this case, that's a free cash for equity, because there's no debt, free cash for equity, we discount back on the cost of equity. The cost of equity is 24% for the first three years because it becomes undiversified, 14% for the next three years, and then 9% when it becomes public property. So let's see how we use these numbers there. Where do I use the present value function to sell it. Or the present value function in the calculator, the present value function anywhere. Why? Because the present value function assumes that this time period is the same every of equity, make it the cost of equity forever. The value that I get is much, much lower, 1.6 billion. And if I go with the 9% cost of equity, public company, I come up with the value of 2.5. drop to nine percent in which case an incentive to go public is kind of disappeared right because i'm already giving you a public company evaluation without any of the same or being a public company like what so this growth requirements no corporate governance no survey and obviously you can already see why private companies especially in the last decade but they chose to stay private right you could have gone public five years earlier than you did Any questions on companies public at all? Well, that's a good question. At some point we see one to cash out. That's the problem. They get, they get invasion. Benchmark invested in one billion dollar company. At 90 billion, might you want to take that money out? I would think so, especially if the price is getting too hot for you. So the need to cash out at some point in time, push the time. So I'm going to start by giving you a very simple example of where option, real option value comes from. It's a very simplistic example, but it's going to illustrate why there is this cream in the test. All the real options are going to allow you to add a cream with the DCF value. Remember how you got a value from $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, $40, million and a 25% chance of failure, in which case you lose 20 million. If you succeed, and only if you succeed, get that upside, then you continue. There's a two-third chance of making 80 million and a one-third chance of making or losing 100 million. part of the argument is based on the fact that you observe something happening out there, and the second part is you adapt the way you behave based on what you would say. How's it currently outside, right? See what I'm adding to the oil curve. In a traditional DCO work, what do you do? You project out the expected number of barrels of oil you're going to sell, calculate the expected oil price, get the value of the auto company, the VCF, everything right is going to be too low and now but they're doing all we cannot talk about how much the value should be. So we're opening up a very very dangerous story because in a sense we're opening the door to something we're all talking about at the start of every finance class. Now you take into account corporate finance, you start capital busting They're big opportunities, but they're not necessarily options. So we're going to talk about when is it makes an option an option? Great question, Mr. Omi. What ingredients that allow you to look at the exact option? Tell me what you mean. First I'll give you a clue. What are options? Try that. The arugula and the leeches. So for a leech to survive on your needs, you need a house. The key word there is right. As opposed to what? You get the right, which means you can choose to exercise or choose not to exercise. There's an underlying asset. There is a contingency built around the right. And if you choose not to exercise, you throw the option away. You do whatever you think is the option. So that's what makes for an option. So with every real option that000, you make the equal, so that's the unlimited profit. So there's the way. And in the case of a put option, you flip things around. Again, you have limited losses, you have non unlimited profits. Why? Price down goes negative. But the essence of options, you have only you have the right to do something, you have significantly to do with that. If you and 15,000 other people have the right to do the same thing, your values must be saved very quickly. If you and everybody else walk to the face of the earth and do what you claim you can do, there is no option. Exclusivity comes from the fact that it's finite. So exclusivity is a keyword and already you can see why many arguments for optionality already fail. Yesterday I was, I heard somebody asking, you know, Randy, Microsoft, how come you're not adding an option pre-intent for AI? This is now the other two buzzwords in one word, optionality AI. This is how you know there's an option you say what drives the value we know what drives the value there are only six things that drive variable option let me list the six variables that determine the value of an option we relate to the underlying act the first is the value of the underlying value, call off cheats asset, the value will drop because the dividends can't be the companies, the smaller companies. So as dividends go up or expected dividends go up, all options will become less valuable, good options become more valuable, so you get the right to sell it. So three variables relating to the underlying asset. Every share on that, talk about the option itself. There are two characters in the option that drive the option back. option. Getting more time to play the game. Remember, you've done nothing. You spot the option. Giving you three years to play the game rather than three months to teach the right thing. So three variables related here in the lucky answer. Two relating to the option. There's one macroeconomic variable that affects the value of the option and it's whatever the risk three is. Can somebody explain to me something? What is the risk three way effect? So if I'm sorry, less valuable because you're receiving that money, but it's now worth less. That's it. Those are the six barriers. Of course, you say, how do I go from there to the value of an option? That's where an option pricing model comes in. A little bit of history on option pricing. Until 1970, the way people valued options much to borrow and how many shares. I have to draw from an option-pressing one. You can do the replicating. Replicating, so the first leg to an option-pressing one is the replicating portfolio, finally the portfolio. The second leg is arbitrage. Words you throw around, but I've always done. But here's how it comes into play. What did I say about the replicating portfolio? model. It's an extraordinary elegant model in terms of how it does. So that's been a living time of replication because I think people look at it and get it, but it doesn't quite fit. Here's what replication is in real call option. I can create something that looks exactly like the call off in terms of cash flow by borrowing money and buying shares in the underlying. something that's around it all over the place. It's not the big deal. The first two are critical. If you have a card option in IBM, can I trade the underlying asset? IBM shares I can buy. Can I trade the option for the Steven So you can see my listed option. You can use an option like this. I told you I was going to use graduate patents as an option. So you're a pharmaceutical company by a patent on a drug. The Black-Scholes model came out, I think, in 1973. They won the Nobel Prize 20 years later for it. And I think it was for four or five years, people started to teach auction prices in the classroom. The Black-Scholes model is based on mathematics, and nobody in the finance class would ever see it. Stochastic calculus. If any of you know stochastic calculus, something physical that you take all the time, but you know it. that right now trades it according to the period they talk about next time period again the time period one the stock can go can go to either 70 or 35. If the stock goes to 70 at that period two can go to 150. So, 35 can jump to 50 or 20. That t equal to two the stock can be 150 or 25 you exercise your right. You're not going to give me the right to take care of it for you. But obviously, you would, right? Buy the shares at $40 instead of $100, you make $60. If the stock was to $50, you would still exercise your right. $50 minus $40 instead. If the stock was to $25, you take the right, you put it in the trash can. I wish I hadn't done that. But you guys know what to do. The growth cap, I'm going to call you, pay for the art. So, you know, as opposed to this. I'm going to say you're going to create a representative portfolio you're going to borrow someone. Let's call that B. You're going to be incredibly attractive to that. All you have to do is bring on X and Y and call it B. And let's support and you have to buy some shares of stock. How many? Let's call that D. You can make some business business. But for the moment let's let B and D go together. You borrow B dollars and you buy D shares. The stock If two equations and two unknowns. If you work long enough and hard enough, there should be no unknowns, right? In this case, I worked long enough and hard enough and I solved with B and B. B equals one, B equals two. What does it even mean? If the stock goes to 10, here's all I need to do. I need to go out and borrow the $36 in four sets. I'm going to keep that for cash growth. I borrow $36 in four sets and buy one share of stock, which costs me how much? I'm going to go out and I'm sorry $35. I'm going to borrow $39.01 and buy 0.4 shares of the stock. See my cap. That position is going to cost me $4.99 and by our class the call has to be worth $4.99. So you see where I am now right. I have the value of the call and t equals 1. and I buy them, there are delta shares of stock, 0.8278 shares of stock. That position cost me $19.42. That is what I need to call off today. That's replication in process. You guys are able to see these slides? Are you still stuck on the can move the stock price to the next day, which means you have a slightest chance of succeeding. What has to be true about the time periods? It has to be very, very, very short, right? Because I might die one day and think of how many different stock prices that I can take by the end of the day. So maybe if I make it a minute, I might succeed. Even that's probably pushing it. Let's say you said that tree is too sharp. I'm going to round out the edges. So you round out the edges of the Christmas tree. What does that tree look like? A normal distribution. Welcome to what the binomial distribution becomes if you make price changes really small and time becomes small. I call it continuous price distribution. to give you an expected value in the same way. The black shows came first by the binomial give you the intuition that leads you back to that. So, turning back to 1971, Fisher, Black and Myers-Jones both are at the University of Chicago. They come to Princeton, I don't know what lunch dinner was. And they decide they're going to develop a more competitive value option. Take them a couple of years. It's the same one. Extended E, five variables, S, A, R, D, and C. When I listed all the variables in the diagram, didn't I come up with six? What's the variable that's missing? Divorce, the original fact shows, dispensed with divorce. You know what? They had so much mathematical drama deriving the closed information that they didn't want to call it a suit when they have drama, Exactly. That's a note. Be one to come back and talk about what is the energy one that that you can shop on a loan is finance K, which is the exercise. Right. And you minus are talking about the budget. So you kind of. Because. What is the money? It's on you. Think that's right. That's the kind of time. But that's not the way we're talking to you. Right. We think one plus R raised the parties and what is the key? to do so. Assume they did it right. They've got the five areas within that, that's what the calculations are. But D1 and D2 are just intermediate stuff, because once you get D1 and D2, here's what you do. You go to normal distribution and N of D1 and N of D2 are areas under the distribution. And they emphasize that again, most statistic books have normal distributions, but they're not areas. They're high distributions. This actually could be it. be one of the two stops you get to get energy, then you get the value of the carbon. And you know, once in your life, you have to actually plug in the number. I think you get out of this one. You have to decide. You do one of the experience of the number of absolute value. But I think that's what you do. You look at the output from the actual one. You're missing something very good. the ground that are beginning to operate are awfully in the form of the green. You option that that's right there. You have the option gamers. In other words, tells you what will happen to your number of shares. So I just thought it goes out. Why do you care? Because you want the head if you need to know what that that would be? What's your option data? options and I can see that up front. There are very few dividends. You might get a straight in example where there's no dividends at all which way they might be which is the black shows. But in many of the real options examples we're going to talk about there will be dividends. You have to deal with them. You can't just make them up. There's a version of the black shows that we developed for cut stock that actually paid dividends. So think of what happens the value of the stock by the expected dividend yield over time. So effectively I'm saying stock is going to get less value over time. I'm going to bring in more. Modern work will need to save the dividend, but it's a way in which you can bring dividends to the black show if you still make it. Number four, we complete this section. One of the challenges we face when You might still be wondering whether it's going to be original, factual, or if it's designed to value what I call European options. Which means, if it's designed to value options, you can get exercise only on that last step. So for this good option, they work fine. But what does that say about a package? It's an option, right? But what is exercising that option doing? What are you going to do? Develop the package. So let's say you have 17 years of life left in your life. One minute time, maybe one day time. Think of how much information you need to do that. And you can already see that I, if I, I'm going to use the black show to value these options. And here's my defense. When you use a European option pricing model, you're still getting a value, but you're getting a slow half. The option exercise value can only increase value. You know the decision tree outside? The decision tree you lay out all the possible outcomes outside. And you can build in. If this happens, you won't continue. A decision tree is a much simpler way to derive the same conclusions you have with an option pricing model without any of the black shows or variance in the option pricing that we're telling today. If your objectives intimidate it fails, you stop. In which case, you need to continue learning under the test cost. If it succeeds, you continue, and you can see that you can say that you're getting what type of diabetes. I get different out. So basically, with Decision in with an optionarity argument three questions asking is there an option should we even be talking about this at the second is there exclusively there'd be exceptions rather than rules. They're used, we should use them rarely because that's where they have the most application. So let me get started on options in projects. So let's go back to the focus scenario where you have a muddling project, but all thoughts are true. You get the expected, because my developer today wouldn't make money. Would I be able to find buyers for its stuff? I'm sure there are companies that snap it up because the fact that it's non-viable today doesn't mean it couldn't. But you need that exclusively. I think you need the rest. So that's the option. Here's the second one. Now things are going to get really terrible. You're entering into a project where you know the head of the company. negative investment development project and justified by saying hey there is another project out there. That's the option to expect. It's often the option that's used for people entering very big markets even though they know they want to make money on their initial effect. And thirdly there's the option for that. The option of enemies being able to walk project for the next five or 10 years can change how you think about the project. Why? Because even though the net present value is negative today, at some point in time, you'll be at a certain point. Technology could change, markets could change. lose whatever you paid outside to get the right to the product. That's the payoff diagram by the underlying logic that looks a lot like the comma option. I'm going to use this option to then talk about two real world options today that we would run into. The first is the pattern. What does the pattern do? It gives you exclusive rights to develop whatever you patented into a combined product. Key word is right, you're not forced to There is a product that emerged from developing the patent that the cost of introducing the product becomes the strike price. The present value of the cash flow you think you can make from the product is something preliminary stock price. If the present value of the cash flows exceeds the cost, you will develop the patent. If not, what happens? almost every textbook that makes up an example. So I want to apply this to the real patent, how would I get the answer? And this is a framework you're gonna see me use almost every real launch. Let's be pragmatic, we need SKRT and SINGLE. See what they are. What's the answer? It's a value of the underlying action, which is if I develop the patents today, what will I get as a second cash flow? So let's say you're my MD. I think in big terms, I'm going to ask you, what's the variance in that pattern? You would run over to the Bloomberg terminal, type in the name of the pattern, and you're going to come back and tell me what to do. I'll find it. Why not? It's not traded. And becomes the sigma that I will use in this option. So I've got my variance. For the X-in-Side Presence of the Option, I have to come up with what it would cost me to convert the time. Because normally this has been done before. I can look over other companies. I've had to spend for what I like to spend. That's what I've been paying for. I've got my S, I've got my sigma, I've got my K. What's the life of this option? Part of you said, let's wait a minute. Why? Because you can get more information, learn more about the market, make a product investment. Good. What's the cost of waiting an extra year? What do you give up? One year of protection. That's what the patent gives you. So you want to give up one year of protection. I want to use a very simplistic measure of what I lose by taking one over that. So by 17 years left, I'm going to take one 17th of the value slot because I'm waiting. Have you ever seen cash flow estimates that companies make for drugs? It's scary, isn't it? Here's what they do. They start with the percentage of the population that has a negative MLS. Then they look at the percentage of people who actually go to see a doctor. It's not 100%. Then they take the percentage of people who actually go to see a doctor and get the right diagnosis. It's not 100%. to other companies. They were a small company, they didn't have the production capacity, selling capacity. But with this drug, they were planning to do it themselves. This was their first big blockbuster drug. And the estimated cost them about 2.875 billion to set up the infrastructure to be able to do it. If I pause right there, 547 million is the present value of my cash flow to develop the drug. 2.875 billion is what I have to invest today to get this process rolling. business here, right? In the short term, which means that that value they waited six months or a year could get much higher. It could get much lower. It's a viable drug. But by waiting they human information, but size is like one of the best drug. The part you can almost see a management team, right? I'd say, let's wait, you know, we learn more about the drug. We can develop a better drug. And the other one said, oh, it's an incredibly bad news. Right? If you're the company now, you're too bad. 547 minutes net present value. If you do what? If you go out and invest in the drug, now you produce it. What's the 907 minute? The auction value. 907 is greater than 547, so even the next wait. You're at home saying, when will the drug arrive? Pfizer were working on their own MS drugs and their window maybe five years not 17. Do you know what the cost of today to be 170 becomes one-fifth you can go one-fifth cost of later the option value actually dropped below the net value here. Here's the bottom line if you are in a competitive pharmaceutical business where let's say you go to my spreadsheet with Avanix and entering the number 10. Let's say you look at the number that you saw in 10, come up with a block question rather than a data question. How would a traditional DCF model be doing in that factory? didn't sell other drugs directly, they licensed them out. And they licensed them out to two major pharmaceutical companies, I forget their name. And the license fees they were getting... There are two ways you can structure a license. You can make it a percentage of revenues or you can get a fixed fee. They chose the fixed fee. In other words, the contractor didn't make 15 minutes guarantee I told you that Biogen had licensed out these two products to the US government, and the US government had guaranteed 50 million every year for this product. It wouldn't be the same. Then you need to, not to be so conservative, but to keep on, right, you need to risk payment. Don't be so quick to pull the cost of capital into your discussion. I know that partly the way you get, you know, hardwired to food is all these things to pull",
