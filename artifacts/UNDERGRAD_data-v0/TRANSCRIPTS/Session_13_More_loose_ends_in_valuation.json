  "text": " um I don't need I don't think you need the reminder that if you don't pick up your quizzes within 10 minutes of this class ending I have to take them back into my office because I've leave them out there during the break God only knows what will happen to them by the time we get back so if you don't want your quizzes I frankly don't care right it you know I know some of you are in denial where if you don't pick up your quiz it's your feedback day right that that's the point in time by which and i'm not i mean just turn in your spreadsheet that's all you need to turn in is turn your spreadsheet i'm not expecting because it's purely for feedback but i need that by i think march 31st that friday whatever i think it is definitely march 31st so that's the date so if you know if you're so But I'm going to give you two companies. Company A, Company B. First company is in a single business. Very easy to understand. Everything is transparent. Company B is in multiple businesses. And there's opaque financials. You know what opaque financials is? The annual report claims to be in English, but you read it, you don't understand a single word of what they say. It's written by lawyers for lawyers. So you read it and you're completely confused. So a simple company, complex company. something like company B by buying five companies in different businesses, right? You can create your own complex in your portfolio. The question is, do you want it in one company or do you want it in five different companies? Yeah. Probably neither. They'll have the same value. They just are more likely. Okay. Let's back up. What is it about company B always a negative surprise. I'm going to give you the time when I started thinking seriously about complexity and what triggered it and how I approach complexity today as part of it. But I wanted to start thinking with some of your companies are easier to value than others. You look across your group as, I wish I'd picked that company. Because you look at your company, it's a mess. It's got 17 different kinds of bonds. It has 15 cross holdings. subtract out the 100 million, which is what you actually owe, in which case your equity is worth nothing? Or should you subtract out the 80 million, which is the market value of the debt, in which case your equity is worth 20 million? If you opened up my textbook and got to that section, you know what I'm going to tell you to do, right? I'm going to ask you to subtract that market value and tell that market value of debt is discounted from the face value. You buy Bed Bath and Beyond, you take the debt at market value. It's going to be 25% of the book value. Treating the difference as the value of equity is kind of, we do it all the time. I'll tell you the assumption, I'll come in and fill in the assumptions we're making, but it does make me uncomfortable when I have a distressed company to be subtracting out the cash. Let's be completely honest, right? And this is going to become the basis for what we think about when we think about what should we do with options? I mean, incentives are a good thing, but the reality is many companies are using stock and options sorry about that this company has just granted 10 million options to its ceo and they're at the money options you know what i mean by that many options the strike price is set equal to the 10 dollars i have a very simple question about the what this is what the effect will be on your value per share before i told you this what do you value per share it 10 dollars per is you get the right to buy shares at $10. If you exercise the option today, it's right. You're right. There's no effect. But no management is going to exercise the option today, right? What are they going to do? They're going to sit on the option. If the stock price goes to $25, they're going to exercise the option, in which case you're selling your shares at a discount to those people. That's what an option pricing model is designed to capture. And at the money option is not worth nothing. point I left you with was closed-end funds, where essentially all your assets are tradable securities with a market price that they typically trade at a discount of around 15%, maybe even 20% on the value. I want somebody to tell me why closed-end funds, why you discount closed-end funds, what's driving it. And to give you some background, if you look to the right, I've given you some facts about closed-end funds. When you invest in a closed-. But if you have a fund that consistently delivers less than what it needs to deliver, remember the cash we said, if you don't make your required return, I'm going to discount cash. You're going to see the same kind of discount with closed-end funds. So here's the implication. If I gave you 100 closed-end funds and I gave you the history of returns, I would expect closed-end funds that do the worst, that have performed the worst, you see the gecko ads right the geico is the insurance company berkshire hathaway owns it it is an incredibly well-run insurance company but if you think about an insurance company what insurance companies do they sell insurance policies they collect premiums those premiums get invested in shares or stock or whatever price to book ratio for an insurance company. And remember, for insurance companies, book value is actually mark to market. So it's basically the market value of a pudding. You should trade it three and a half, four times book value. The way I used to describe this in the late 90s when I talked about Berkshire Hathaway is if you like Coca-Cola as a company and you want to buy it, you could pay a price, market price. But if you bought Coca-Cola, beat the market, right? It's one of the toughest things to do is to beat the market consistently. Warren Buffett earned that reputation the hard way. He's getting old. We don't have to look far. How old is he? 91 years old. I'm not giving you a secret. He is going to die one of these days. You've ever heard from them? It's still Buffett and Munger, right? The reality is this is not something you can pass on to somebody else, no matter who you are. The Buffett premium is fading because he's getting older. There are other forces that are affecting value investing, but that's at the core of the disappearance of the premium. So when you look at Berkshire Hholdings, and it's a mess. There are three ways in which crossholdings can be classified. The first, you own three, four, five percent of a company, and you take no one holding it had as a company. It was an investment they made in another company called Yahoo that had taken off and become a $100 billion company. So SoftBank's holding in Yahoo was worth about $7 billion, and half the value of SoftBank as a company. You have to use what's called the equity approach. What's the equity approach? In your income statement, you have to show 15% of the net income or net loss from the better than dividends. At least you're translating that through. And in your balance sheet, you have to show what you originally invested plus or minus 15% of the retained earnings set. So it's like an updated book value. Better, right? And then you get to a 60% holding. Accountants flip out. 60% say, what do you think I've been trying to tell you all this time? You don't own 40%. Yeah. We have to show the 40% that doesn't belong to you because it doesn't belong to you. So you know what ends up happening on your balance sheet because you acted like you owned a hundred percent of a subsidy. They already 60% of you to show the 40% that doesn't belong to you. First on which side of the balance sheet asset libraries. Sure. what I'm trying to say in a long-winded way is if you have a company with lots of cross-holdings the first thing to understand is the accounting of those cross-holdings and it's not easy I've had companies where this has been my biggest roadblock is figuring out how a company is recording cross-holdings because without knowing it I don't even know what to do with those so let's talk about how you would value cross-owners. Sounds messy, right? So I'm going to give you an example. So from 2013 or 2014, I valued Yahoo. Yahoo in 2014 had just, you know, they had a new CEO, Marissa Meyer. She'd come over from Google, great reputation, was going to turn the company around. And I valued the company in three parts. First, I tookaba as a standalone company with its own cash flows, growth, and risk, and took 22% of that. Yep. Alibaba was backed by Alibaba? They had filed it. This is why I had to wait for the prospectus to be filed. I know the timing of this particular valuation was right after the prospectus came out, before they actually went to the market. They actually went public at about 200 billion. So my estimate of intrinsic value reflected what I saw in the prospectus. But basically, I did intrinsic valuations of all three pieces. But think of what allowed me to do it. I had full financial statements for all three companies because at the prospectus for Alibaba, Yahoo Japan was a standalone company. Yahoo gave me parent company numbers. at the financials for this Japanese company, and they tell me that they have 227 cross holdings. My stomach drops, because if I'm a careful analyst doing intrinsic valuation, you know what I should do next, right? I should value 227 other companies from scratch. I'm way too lazy to do that. But let's say I'm not as lazy as I actually am, and then I say, okay, I'm going to value 227 other companies. I wouldn't have been able. If I own a thousand shares of your company, I'm part owner of the company. You're refusing to tell me what I own. She thinks for a few seconds that you have a point, but it is still proprietary. At this point, I'm banging my head against a brick wall. I get ready to hang up the phone and she says, wait, I do have some information I can give you about these subsidies. I said, okay, expecting some revenues or operating income. I said, So the challenge you often face in practice is you don't have the numbers to do an intrinsic valuation of just too many companies. I mean, let's face it, even if I had the financials, do you really want to value 227 companies to decide whether to buy one company? I don't. So I'm going to give you some shortcuts you can use. Let's say with a Japanese company. I told you 60 of these companies were publicly traded, right? value. You see the cheating game there? You take the 10 million book value, apply 1.5 as a multiple. Isn't that my estimated? I know it's short. But when you have dozens and dozens of crossholdings, rather than value each of them, often you take that practice. So you want to see a pricing of Yahoo? Much less time. So here's what I did. I took the three pieces and rather than try to do an intrinsic valuation of each, I priced each one. We haven't got hurry. We have too many crossholdings. And if you have a company with lots of crossholdings, unless you're one of those companies where crossholding is 80% of your company's value, the shortcut might do a pretty good job of taking care of those crossholdings so you can move on. So that's the crossholding. And as I said, it's not easy. It's, I'll tell you, on quiz two, that I hope you never violate. You can't double count on this. So if you're a hotel company and I do a discounted cashflow valuation of you as a hotel business, where I look at your revenues, you know what you can't do? You can't add the value of the real estate that you sit on to your discounted cashflow valuation. Why not? Because that real estate is what's generating the cashflow. So you can't count the cashflows on an asset and the value of the real estate. So if you're valuing JP Morgan with a dividend of money, especially with CERN, they notice you have a lot of money, then come and ask you for money. I've never been part of the process. I hate asking for money. And why would I want to bring money into a university where I know how much is going running the fund comes in and he says, I'm facing a conundrum. Very quickly, I had to turn to my computer, type in the word conundrum. And he was confused. But I liked the word. I said, what's your conundrum? He said, I'm valuing Playboy. I said, I don't see a conundrum yet. He said, I've valued it at 240 million. It's priced at 300 million. I said, I still don't see a conundrum. I liked the word so much, I was going to use it every year. You don't buy the company. He said, here's but you have a problem. There's an 81-year-old in a bathrobe hanging out in that mansion that you can't exactly throw out onto the street, right? Because you know who was living in the mansion. Hugh Hefner was still there. So he said, what should I do? I said, check the actuarial tables. So what am I checking for? And Playboy managed to have its cake and eat it too. Here's what it did. It sold the mansion to a Greek billionaire with Hugh Hefner in it. I'm not kidding you. The guy bought the mansion on the contingency that Hugh Hefner could live out the remaining years in the mansion. So why would he do that? Reflected glory or whatever reflection you get out of the Playboy mansion. They actually sold it for $200 million. world office story, story names, and I value them as what else? Let's take the world office story. Let's have value as a hotel. What does that mean? I project out occupancy rates of the hotel, charge a price, take the present value. Let's say I come up with 600 million. And then I look at the value of the real estate that that hotel is sitting on, and I come up with the value of a billion. some point in time, as real estate becomes more valuable, you're gonna switch away from being a hotel company. The other is, especially at peak real estate prices, you get what's called a sale and lease back. You sell the real estate, you collect the high price, and then you lease it back, hopefully at some discount rate and you continue to buy the simple company, because there's so much in the complex company you don't know that when you get a surprise, it's more likely to be a negative surprise. I'll be quite honest. First 15 years I taught valuation, I didn't think seriously about it. Then in the late 90s, there was a company called Tyco that had an accounting scandal and ended up losing almost 80% of its value. I'll tell you what Tyco was. It doesn't sound fair, but that's how investors adjust. I was actually teaching a valuation class, which is pretty much every year, unless it's sabbatical, I'm doing it. So during the class, somebody said, well, now should we be, now we have a company like Tyco, should we be discounting the value for this kind of bad stuff? And I said, probably. And then I said, there are two questions we need to address. We want to bring complexity into value. We want to say complex companies are worth less than simpler companies in the 10Q and the 10K. I know it's incredibly simplistic, but play along with me. If you wanted to avoid valuing one company in this group, which company are you not going to want to value? What the heck is this? 1,026 pages. This isn't war and peace. This is how many pages it took Citigroup to tell me what happened in one year. Takes you 1,000 pages plus to tell me what happened last year. You want a heck of a screwed up company. any of the geographies. It's like, you know, Lord of the Rings universe. It's not any universe that I'm familiar with. I remember the first time I valued BMW. Correct the revenue stand of North America, South America, Oceania. Turns out to be Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, but you can see if you bundle them together. So these are things that bug me. Tax rates that move wildly, semester in addition to valuing your company for your project, why didn't you come up with a complexity score? It wasn't a question. It was an edict. They bitched and they moaned, but it's too late. They should just pick the number of pages that I offered them the previous week. That semester in addition to valuing companies, every person in the class had to come up with a complexity score. I'm glad I did it because we learned something about complexity that semester. Some of you are struggling with companies that grow through acquisitions, and you're already seeing some of the issues, right? When you have acquisitions, your capex is lumpy. You do a big acquisition, you don't do one for two years, and it creates accounting debris, things like goodwill and writing off of restructuring. And finally, they found that any company with a financing arm embedded in it was incredibly more complex than a company without. If you can't figure out what's going on in the company, you can't even ask any good questions, right? You're managing the company badly. I have no idea. You're doing it for control. You're doing it for the fact that people can't ask you questions. And essentially it protects you as management. So that semester, the most complex company in the class, the people came up with was GE. acquisitions, it is almost like Jack said, how can I make a company that's so incredibly difficult to understand that people will just give up? So think about complexity. And when you look at your company, you see this messy stuff in the company. Some of it is by design. It's there to obscure the truth. And your job is to get past and make your best effort. So once you've measured complexity, what do I do about it? So let's cut down to basics, whatever choice. I broke it up into two groups of 250 companies. One group that I called 250 simpler companies and the other group 250 complex companies. A little bit of subjective judgment, but I mean, then I computed the implied cost of equity. Remember how I did the implied equity risk with the entire market? I did the implied cost of equity for the complex half and the implied cost of equity for the simple half. And at least at that time when I did it, the complex half of the S capital about the cost of capital? I could give you a good reason. It's a pharmaceutical company. It's got patents. These are big blockbuster drugs. I understand where the returns on capital come. In contrast, if you have a complex company, you see they're making money, but you have no idea where they're making money or how they're making money. Even if they're making a 20% return on capital, if I ask you, can they keep doing what they're doing? If you don't know what they're doing, how can you make that assumption? the underlying accounting scandals. But my response was, if you don't know how they're making money, you can't assume they can keep making it. You've got to bring the return on capital down to the cost of capital very quickly, which will reduce your value as a company. And it sounded unfair that I was punishing a successful company, but with complex companies, sometimes the best way to deal with it is to say, look, if I don't understand the company, I really can't tell a story, a sustainable story, about them being able to continue to do what they're doing, and that's going to in the number of pages in the 10K into the regression. First, I wanted to look at this coefficient and give me an intuitive reading of what that does. all people. It was going to be a real estate broker with Caldwell. It was going to be an insurance company. It was going to be a bank. It was going to be a portfolio manager. Great ambitions, but sometimes in the process you create this mess of a company that people look at and say, I give up. I think money-centered banks are contaminated by this. Since 2008, people just don't trust money-centered banks because too many different businesses. Every three years, what do you have? You have a scanner. Some On the first one, when you asked me what debt should I use for the cost of capital, my advice is take an arrow on your definition of debt. If you remember, I said use all interest-bearing debt and lease it should be treated as debt, no matter what the accountant says. Now that they've come around to my point of view, you're getting convergence, but all interest-bearing debt and leases, but stop there. Fight the urge to start adding other stuff into debt. The reason you have to fight the urge back. Remember, you're the equity investor. This is your last chance to deal with anything that worries you. So in addition to the debt that you add in your cost of capital, if you have underfunded pension obligations, do you have to come up with that money at some point in time? Unless you get government to pick it up. So when you get from the value of the firm to debt, you might use a more expensive definition of debt where you bring in things you did not include as debt and your cost of capital. lose a million dollars and there's a 10% chance you could lose the lawsuit. That's pure probability. The expected value of that lawsuit is minus 100 million. You've got to subtract it out to get to the value directly. That sounds like a strange thing to do, but what do you think tobacco company investors have been doing for the last 30 years? They've been valuing tobacco companies and having to bring in this expectation that some of their value is going to go away because of lawsuits. I find this the entire process by which you end up paying a lawsuit to be so convoluted. Because it's not just one suit where you win or lose, right? You got appeals process and appeals of appeals and appeals of appeals. I remember about 15 years ago, you know, I'm in my office, three students from the law school show up. And they said, aren't you in the wrong building? That time you didn't need an ID, you could come into any building. So they walked. They said, they said, you German pharmaceutical company, bought a company called Monsanto about six, seven, maybe more than that, huge acquisition. At that time, they had all these strategic reasons for buying. But when they bought Monsanto, they bought themselves a huge legal promise. You know the legal promise? What did Monsanto bring into Bayer? It can be an issue that drains your value. And if you're investing in a company, when this is a worry, you've got to bring it in explicitly when you benefit them. So when you think about what you should subtract out, be expansive in your definition, your lawsuits, you might have to bring them into the... And if you have things like underfunded pension obligations, legal obligation, they might not be part of debt when you do cost of capital, but you should be incorporating them when you think about what do I... Now, how do I come up with the value of equity in a company if you do buybacks. Because, you know, senators don't like buybacks. I think it's a terrible thing. They want to discourage companies from buying back stocks. It's a kettle of fish I don't want to open up. But there's, you know, Congress often passes laws. So guess what happened over the next decade? Pay went crazy because companies decided to pass out options and aided and abetted by accountants telling you that when you give an option, which is at the money you're giving away, nothing, they gave away tens of millions of options. Law unintended consequences. So if you look at the starting point for employees being first what has been done in the past. So let's start with restricted stock, because they're easy to deal with. I'm a company. I pay my employees with restricted stock. Remember we said you do this because you don't ignore restricted stock. They're always in the footnotes, but bring them in as part of the share value. What's so different about options? To understand the issues that come with options, let's think of a very simplistic and simple reason why options affect your value. Options affect your value because you give the right to somebody to buy shares at and why it might lead you to the wrong place. So I'm going to set up a simple example because I think that the best way to do this is actually with the simple example. So let's assume that you have a firm, you value the firm. Let's say the value of the firm is 2 billion. You've got debt of a billion, come up with a value of equity of 1 billion. I'm sorry, this is the example. You have a hundred million shares, billion divided by a hundred million gives you a value per share of $10. I issue options, at the money options. And this is exactly the example that I did. What you do is you take into account the 10 million shares that will come due when the options, we act like they're already out. So you keep the value of the equity at a billion. You divide by 110 million shares rather than 100 million shares. You get a value of $9.09. I think you've undervalued your company for a very simple reason. What am I missing? Half of all analysts probably use the bludgeon book, maybe a higher percentage. There's a diluted chest. I've taken a fully diluted approach to deal with options, you really aren't dealing with options. You're doing basically adjusting the count and leaving everything else unchanged. Is there a simple fix to that? Add 100 million to the new grade. That's called the treasury stock approach. In the treasury stock approach, that's what you do. You take the billion in equity value, add the 100 million you get from the exercise proceeds, The treasury stock approach is screwed up because it doesn't consider the time premium. So I'm going to push you into the third approach. So what do I need to do? I need to bring the time premium. How the heck am I going to do that? What is an option pricing model? Forget about the mechanics. What am I doing with an option pricing model? I'm basically getting an expected value for the option across all those options are not going to be worth zero, because there's time left in the option, I might come up with 3 million, 7 million, 15 million. I'm going to subtract the value of the options from my equity value. Let me the share car. But it's always been the case that you can value options. But I'll give you the caveats. Option pricing models, the black show, the binomial were designed to value listed options on the Chicago Board of Options. You know, the typical life of those options was three months, six months, and then designed to value short-term options. have 10 million options decide to exercise you know what's going to happen the second you announce you're going to exercise them the 10 and 15 cents is going to become 9 and 75 cents because people are going to factor in the dilution so we need an option pricing model that can deal with long-term options and also deals with this problem of early exercise that you know there's also a third problem which is traditional option pricing models assume that I'm going to adapt. Adapt them to do what? Adapt them to more longer term options, which means my variance estimates have to be better. Adapt them for delusion, which means my stock price will be a shifting for issuing options. The company said, no, maybe I shouldn't issue options. We'll go with restricted stock. They're easier to manage. So thank God for that. I'm glad that we've shifted away from options. But there are still some companies out there, like Cisco, that are big grantors of options. So next session, when we start, we're going to use an option pricing model to value the options and bring it in. But we're also going to talk about what about option brands in the future. This takes care of options in the past. But what if I expect my company to keep",
