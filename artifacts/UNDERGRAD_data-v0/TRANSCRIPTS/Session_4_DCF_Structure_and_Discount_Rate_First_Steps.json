It's just that you're, until the sound subsides, you can't hear me. So I'm going to start to say pick one soon right so no obviously we're still early in the class but the longer you put this off it doesn't get any easier so pick one sir any any other questions before we get started one final point i want to emphasize start to delve into the details of valuation. And we're going to start simple. To value something, you need to get a risk-free rate. Now, it sounds fancy, but you need to know what you can make on a guaranteed investment before you get all ambitious and say, what will I make on a risky investment? So today, we're going to talk about risk-free rates. And in the process, we're going to crack what I call the currency code, which is a lot of people misunderstand now. So same company, same point in time, same financials. You can value it in reais, you can value it in dollars. The risk-free rate in reais is much higher than the risk-free rate in dollars. Which of these two currencies would give you the higher value of the company, if either? You want to try? Yeah. That's not a first principle. That's almost, I hope it's true. So, you know, what exactly happens to your cash flow is to offset the discount rate effect. You got to start to become explicit about what is it that causes risk-free rates to vary across currency. If it's growth, then you're in trouble because then how can you have a high growth company in one currency and a low growth company in another currency? So when you say growth, are you talking about nominal growth? Nominal growth, which means it's not growth, it's why the difference is in nominal growth. The matter whether you do real or nominal? Today, we're going to talk about what would you do differently when you value a company in real terms, because you're now ignoring that inflation part of the growth that gives you this first principle of it doesn't matter. Our end result is we want it to not matter because if your company comes out with different valuations, depending on the currency you pick Because the Fed has kept them low. Doing what? Quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, Titanic, whatever you want to call it, basically that they've been doing all this neat stuff. That's why rates are low. I mean, if you listen to people long enough, it seems like the Fed controls rates. In fact, we're heading up to an FOMC meeting, Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Like today might be the day, right? Everything on Wall Street comes to a complete stop. borrowing rate. Because again, I think there's a lot of mythology about central banks that we need to dispense with. One final point. This is perhaps no longer true, but about a year or two ago, start of 2022, there were at least three, maybe as many as five currencies where the risk-free rate was negative. And it Negative risk-free rates are not a sign of health. They're a sign of deep damage in the economy. There are two parts of the world where we've had negative risk-free rates for a long period now. One is Japan, and the other is much of Europe. a money-making company. So we have a lot on our plate today to deal with. So let's get the process started. So let's present value of the expected cash flows on that asset over its lifetime right so you have a 10-year asset you do 10 years of cash flows 20-year asset 20 years of cash flows when you buy shares in a publicly traded company at least in theory how long is its lifetime you open a corporate charter tells you when the company is founded it buys you an infinite series in mathematics 200 years ago mathematicians solved for the value of the series we stole it in finance we act like we invented it but this is this famous terminal value equation you'll see at the end of every valuation it's basically the present value of all cash flows beyond your five or ten with that equation but for that to work your cash flows have to be estimating cash flows. It's too much trouble, too many estimates. I'm just going to look at the cash flows the company actually returns to its shareholders. In a purer sense, that's the only cash flow you actually get from the company as an equity investor, right? Everything else is kind of on paper. The dividend discount model is the oldest discounted cash flow model out there. Let me ask you, are you valuing equity? it's not manna from heaven it's a direct reflection of the fact that year after year they've chosen not to pay out i'm not saying it's good or bad but i'm saying what companies pay out is set by management but it might not match what they could have paid out so the second way to do valuation is not trust the dividend but to estimate what the company could have paid in dividends and guess what it's very simple to do how much can companies afford to pay in dividends whatever's cash flow to equity starts growing at a constant rate forever. So as I go through these different approaches, I want you to think of both what you do in common across the approaches and what's different. So dividends and free cash flow to equity are both equity valuation approaches. One uses actual dividends. One uses potential dividends. The third approach, of course, is step back and say, I don't care just about the equity. I care about the entire capital providers, both debt and equity. Look at the collective cash flow. And I'm going to discount them at the cost of equity. And what I get as a present value is the value of equity in that company. There are still people who hold on to this model. The problem is a smaller and smaller part of the market fits into this model because fewer and fewer companies pay the kinds of dividends where you look at the dividends and say that's pretty close to what they could have paid out. Maybe phone companies like Con Ed. A free cash flow equity model looks exactly the same, know what the value of cash is. So here I have the luxury of saying I can value all of the non-cash equity in the company and add the cash at the end. I get the value of equity. And then, of course, you've got the most generic version of the model. I estimate a pre-debt cash flow. And as I said, again, don't worry about the equation. We'll come back and talk about the specifics of how we come to. But these are pre-debt cash flows. We the process by which we do valuation. And the reason I'm going to generalize is we all go through this process, how much attention we pay to each stage of the process differs across people. So let's say you pick the company. What's the first step? What's the next step for you? Once you pick the company, What the heck is going on here? Okay. You're doing it because you want to get some questions answered, which you can use to project it. It's all about the future. So the only reason we're looking at the past is to get better clues about the future. In particular, as you look at past data, there are three questions I want you to try to answer. How quickly has my company grown in the past? My suggestion is focus on revenue Peloton, there might be very little you learn. Don't beat yourself up. That's what it is. But we start with the past, not because we want to stay stuck in the past, but we're looking for clues for the future. So you assess the past, and then you try to forecast the future. I'm going to give you the two generic forecasting ways of doing this, depending on the company you have. If you have a company with stable operating margins, you make on that investment. I'll give you an example. You invest 50% of your money. You make a 20% return on capital. Your expected growth in operating income is going to be about 10% a year, 50%. It's a very neat and mechanical way of doing valuation, but it works because your margins are stable. We'll talk about the algebra that makes but next year, two years out, three years out. Revenues times margins gives me operating income. Last step, I'm going to look at what I need to reinvest to get that revenue growth. But my end game is still free cash for the firm. How I get there is different in the two scenarios. So I start with the past. I project out, I forecast out the future. And how long do I have to keep forecasting? Till I get to a point where I'm willing to tell you company. I heard that about Walmart in the 1980s. Because it was an incredible growth company, an amazing company. Until it got to about a half a trillion dollars in revenue. So it took a half a trillion before it hit the wall. In contrast, Groupon hit the wall at 10 billion. Why? Smaller competitive advantages, lots of players in the game. Where you hit the wall is where you put the company, but don't punish yourself. Am I getting this right? And at some point in time, you put closure and say, at this point in time for my company, I'm going to be a mature company. And along the way, of course, you've got to discount these cash flows at a discount rate that reflects the riskiness of the company. I'm going to lay the foundations for how to think about discount rates. You see one discount rate and it never changes. In fact, there are some appraisers who are shocked. You really can change discount rates over time? That should be the rule, not the exception. Maybe if you gave me a company that is already mature, I can get away using one discount rate. But how can I value a company that's evolving and changing and not see the discount rate change? So for the moment, I'm not going to dive into the mechanics of risk premiums and betas. but to make estimates. And please don't use subjective as a curse. It's so subjective. Of course it's subjective. How can it not be subjective? Because you're looking at the facts and making your, if that's your definition of subjective, be glad it's subjective. Because if it were not subjective, why would you need to take this class? Right? You could build a model that automates everything or use chat GPT to do your evaluations. and 80 to 90% on the cash flows. That's what a good valuation should look like. You know what a banking valuation time breakdown is? 70 to 80% of your time is spent estimating discount rates. And then towards the very end say, oh my God, I don't have cash flows. Let me make up some crap. When you're going to screw up on a valuation, and I'm not saying that's a good objective, it's going to be because you got the cash flows wrong, not because you got the discount rate wrong. And again, in this class, I want you to get away from the places where you're comfortable and get to the places which make you uncomfortable. Because that's where valuation battles are won or lost. So let's start talking about discount rates. First, let's lay the consistency point that we started last class. If you have equity cash flows, it should be the cost of equity. If you're trying to discount cash flows to the firm, it's got to be cost of capital. Today, I'm going to add on two more consistency rules. So to do all of this, we go back and lay the foundations for discount rates. So when you think about the risk-adjusted discount rate, there are three ingredients you need to get to a risk-adjusted. The first is you need a risk-free rate, whatever currency you're doing your valuation. You cannot do valuation without a risk-free rate. Second, you need to measure what the price of risk is in the market. What are people charging for investing in equities? What's the talking about? Here's your first choice. Is it estimation uncertainty or is it economic uncertainty? Estimation uncertainty is uncertainty you feel because you haven't collected enough data. collecting more data, doing more research. You know what happens to the economic uncertainty as you do more research? You actually get more uncertain. There's a time in valuation. I call this the karmic point, where you basically say, I've done all I can. I need to move on. I want you to recognize that point because otherwise you're going to frustrate yourself trying to collect data. Stop using Google search. There's a point at which it gets counterproductive of tesla what are all the things you're uncertain about what leon must do tomorrow what about day after tomorrow will the shanghai plan be allowed to open in six months micro uncertainty what's macro uncertainty what will inflation do what will what will happen to oil prices you think why bother macro uncertainties are the only uncertainties you build into discontents It's not designed for that kind of risk. And finally, you have discrete uncertainty versus continuous uncertainty. I'll give you the easiest way to see the divide. Let's say a U.S. company with revenues in a country with fixed exchange rates. There are fewer and fewer countries, but this is true. You have fixed exchange rates. You know what's true, right? Every day you wake up, you look at the exchange rate. It's the same as it was the day before. This is good, right? There's no uncertainty. There's no uncertainty. There's no uncertainty. built around continuous uncertainties. We're very good. All of the risk and return models in finance are really about continuous uncertainties. The uncertainties we're not very good at are dealing with are discrete, like bankruptcy, nationalization, a CEO going into rehab, regulation. We're terrible at dealing with it because we're using the wrong tools. The tools we need are statistical tools, right? What's the likelihood of the marginal investor in the company. If you have all your money in Tesla, God help you, then you have no choice. You're saying, I'm exposed to micro and macro. But that was a choice you made. And guess what? The market doesn't reward people for making bad choices. We can come back and talk about what we do when this is not true. But when you look at risk, at least in terms of how we think about risk, But in general, bringing micro uncertainties into discount rates for publicly traded companies is asking to be rewarded for something you shouldn't be rewarded for. I'll give the analogy, really stupid one, but take it. Let's say you buy a house across a six lane highway. And your brokerage house where you trade is across the highway. So every morning, here's what you do. You wake up, you drink a lot of coffee. And when we think about the risk in a company, I don't mean to belittle you, but it's not your risk or my risk that we should be thinking about. It's the risk of the marginal investor in the company. Who the heck is a marginal investor? The marginal investor is the investor who sets prices. I don't affect prices. When I buy a thousand shares of Apple, no matter how much I wish upon that trade, it doesn't change the price. institutional investors, just like Apple is, because they're the ones setting the price each day. So when we look at risk, we look at the risk through the eyes of marginal investors who are diversified, and at least in value publicly traded companies. That's why we stay with only that part of the risk you cannot diversify away. That's why I said macro risk, inflation, interest rates, real GDP growth, and how it shows up in your discount rate. those two assumptions are, think of why most investors stop diversifying, even those who are not stock pickers. Think of the two reasons you stop. One is there's a transactions cost, right? It's tiny, but as you get more and more stocks in your portfolio, the marginal benefits of adding that stock become smaller and smaller. And if you're a stock picker, you also think you can pick the right stocks, right? So the have no private information there are no transactions cost in the cap and that's where you end up what should we call that portfolio that has everything in the market well let's call it the market portfolio what a creative title we all end up holding the factors are specified but the end game is the same you have a risk free rate plus a measure of relative risk that's what beta is and a risk premium either for one market portfolio for each factor center but every one of these models starts with a risk free rate later on we'll come back and talk about beta and risk premium but let's start with risk free rate so in the CAPM you need default risk, because something in default, you're not guaranteed the return. So let's say there's a default-free entity. Let's make the U.S. But what's the part that's out of your control? What could happen to a 10-year T-bond over the next year? If interest rates change, what happens to the price of your bond? Remember, there's a remaining life on the bond. There is this legend of US treasuries being a safe haven. I've heard this enough that it terrifies me. percent those return stocks bonds were down 18 percent as well that's why you had a 60 40 70 30 80 20 portfolio it doesn't matter right minus 18 minus 18 what does it care what the weights are on the two so what i'm trying to say is for something to be risk-free there can be no default risk you can also have no reinvestment risk if you have a 10-year cash flow don't be using t-bills to discount that it's not risk-free because if you have a government bond rate in a currency that it is default free. Is that true though? What is the logic that's given for why government bonds in the local currency are default free? Why is the Indian government viewed as default free when it borrows in Indian rupees? but companies do default, even if they issue bonds in the local currency. Why might that be? If it's so easy to pay off the debt, why would you choose to default when you can print the money and pay off the debt? Yes. If you print the money and pay off the debt, it's true you've avoided default, but you've debased your currency, right? And here's the practical question. What's easier to come back from? lost trust. And the way this manifested itself was no Brazilian entity, including the Brazilian government, was able to issue long-term bonds in reais for almost 15 years after hyperinflation. Because would you want to buy a 10-year bond issued by a government in reais when you've been burned? Nobody wanted to. It took the Brazilian government, I think 2006 or 2007 was the first time the Brazilian government issued real denominated bonds. example where I put it in the note. If I put in how much would you pay for that? It was worth about 40 cents four years ago. It's worth nothing now. That's what happens with inflation. 100 trillion. When you have 100 trillion on a note, you know you've lost the script, right? You imagine going into a store, you buy groceries and they say, that'll be 500 trillion. It'll make you feel really rich to be dishing it out. again. Four years later, you default again. We're back again. You know what Latin America has taught us about inflation and everything we know about inflation we've learned from Latin America? It's easier to come back from default than it is to come from debasement. And countries have taken that to heart, which effectively means that government bond rates are not necessarily risk-free. So here's what I'm going to do to kind of disentangle risk-free rates. your duration mismatching right your cash flows are forever three month t-bill rate a t-bill rate should never ever be used in a dc evaluation about one in five dcfs that i see use the t-bill rate as a risk rate already you've lost the script shouldn't be there what about a 10-year t-bond rate a little better right but if you give it a choice there's also 30 a bond and that seems like it's even better because your cash flows don't stop at your 10 your bond. This is just the start of my process. After I get a risk-free rate, what do I need to estimate? Default spreads, equity risk premiums. And I have to estimate them relative to my risk-free rate. You know how I get default spreads? I look at corporate bonds and then I compare the rates on those corporate bonds to a T-bond. If I make my risk-free rate a 30-year T-bond, I have to find 30-year corporate bonds. It's really difficult what do you get actually as a coupon each year? If your inflation is 3% that year, you get 1.5 plus 3%, 4.5%. If it's 8%, you get 9.5% as your coupon. It's a real rate. File that away. Right now, I don't want to use it because my valuation is in nominal dollars. But maybe when I do a real valuation, remember, I want to take inflation out. This could come into play. As for choices E and F, please don't go there. you're not going to default that used to be an easy assumption 15 years ago now it's debatable right in fact in 2012 it became a very open question to debate because snp lowered the rating for the u.s from triple a to double a not a terrible rating it's still a really good rating but they opened the door saying you know what there could be default risk expected cash flow. We are taking expectations across scenarios. But remember, the world is not a discrete place. It's a continuous place, right? It's not like I can say the world has three scenarios, deep recession, shallow recession, recovery. So the problem with probability scenarios that are designed for Brexit, we can talk about probabilities. But when you talk about the economy, where you have a continuum from minus, I won't put you on the spot. A Portuguese company? Porsche. So a Porsche German company. Right? It's really a multinational that happens to be part... Good company to value. So you want to value the company in euros, you project the cash flows in euros, you need a risk-free rate in euros, right? My questions are always good. I like the day. You see where I'm going, right? It's in euros. Why are these rates different? Why do different governments have different rates? Why does the Greek government have a higher tenure rate than the German government? There is default risk, right? And what do we say about a risk-free rate? It cannot have default. Nobody wants to put their hand up. You're planning to value an Indian company? Or you're planning to value Reliance? Okay, good luck with that. It's like Ambani with a different twist on it. So let's say Reliance. You want to value a company in Indian rupees, you need an Indian repeaters credit. The Indian government does have a 10-year bond denominated in rupees. In fact, at the start of 2023, the rate on that bond was 7.34%. It's good, right? Local currency rating is the rate, default risk they see in India when it borrows in rupees. I hoped and I prayed that I would see a AAA rating. If I had, you know what I'd have done? I'd have used the 7.34% as my risk-free rate in rupees and blame Moody's if something went wrong. What I saw instead was a BAA3 rating, much better rating than it used to be 20 years ago. But what is Moody's telling me? There is default risk in this bond. I have the government bond rate, 7.34%. I have a default spread of 2.69%. My objective is to come up with a risk-free rate in rupees, and I'll give you the choices. I can be stubborn and say, I'm just going to use the 7.34%, which is what 90% of Indian analysts do. It's the government bond rate. It's a government bond. It's almost unpatriotic. Somebody accused me of being so, how come you're being so unpatriotic? I said, this has nothing to do with patriotic. If I have to do this, I think we're going to end up double counting country risk. If I use the 7.34% and I call it the risk-free rate, you know, when I get to my equity risk premium, what are you going to be tempted to do? And say, it's an Indian company. I'm going to use a higher equity risk premium. This is my process for keeping risk where it's supposed to be, the risk premium. And the risk-free rate cleans up for the defaulters. So let's talk a little bit about that spread, right? Because without that spread, you can't come up with a risk-free rate. Yeah. cleaning up. So let's talk about how you can come up with this. The 2.69% came out of right field, left field, middle field, somewhere from out there. So where do you come up with that? So I'll give you the three ways in which you can get default spreads. One is if your country issues dollar or euro denominated bonds, you'd compare the rate on that bond to a UST bond, and that difference will be a default spread. The Brazilian government, for instance, cannot get the first two, you can tell me a rating for the country. I created a lookup table based on other countries with similar ratings and said, this is what the typical spread looks like. So I'll go through all three with the Brazilian government so you can see what it works out to, but you had a question, I'm sorry. Oh, sorry. So let's take Brazil. Let's suppose your job is to assess the default spread for Brazil so that you can use it to come compare to something risk-free. A lot of East European countries, for instance, have Euro bonds that you can compare to the German bond to get a spread. If I wanted to get a default spread for Greece or Spain, I can do it with the German bond. But you need a risk-free entity in that bond. Here's the second, the sovereign CDS market. There are about 75 countries right now on which you can go an insurance market with counterparty risk. You know what counterparty risk is? You buy insurance, but you're not guaranteed that the insurance will be delivered if the counterparty defaults. In fact, in 2008, when Lehman went bankrupt, it was a big problem because they were a big player in the sovereign CDS market. They'd sold insurance. Fat lot of good that, and I subtracted it out from the sovereign CDS spread, saying, look, part of this is friction. I want to get rid of it. So we clean up for it. The spread you come up with for Brazil is 3.2%, 3.52 minus 0.3. So somebody keeping track, 2. can't get the other two. And if you can give me the sovereign rating for your country, I can tell you based on the start of 2023, other countries with similar ratings, what the default spread should be. And a BA2 rating, which is what Brazil had, would give me a default spread of 3.68%. So 2.27% from the government bond market, 3.2% real risk-free rate? I've kind of given away the answer. You're doing your analysis in real terms. This has nothing to do with dollars or reais. You want a real risk-free rate. The PIPS rate is a real risk-free rate. You say, but it's in dollars. No, no, there is no dollar in a real, right? It's a real risk-free rate. The currency kind of dissipates. You put me most of the world, you can use the tips rate as your risk-free rate. I'm going to stop there, but when we start on Monday, we'll talk more about what else drives the risk-free rate. uh",
