  "text": " Okay, we're going to stay. If you're going to stay in class, please sit down'll let you know when the quizzes are done. You can come pick them up. last session I was talking about valuing patterns as options right so somebody explain to me again what the rationale is what is it about a pattern that makes it an option hey folks if you want to leave go ahead and leave the room and you can just have your discussions outside class is on right now okay so what is it continue those cash flows might default. That's why I use the cost of debt of the guarantors. Which brings me to the third and final leg of valuing biogens. Are the value of their existing products? Are the value of Avonex as a patent? Let's talk about the value of R&D as a continuing part of the company. So first, what does R&D create? So when you have a department, there are expenses, right? There are costs.. So I'm going to assume that they can continue to earn that 3% accessory tax. At the end of 10 years, what happens? R&D becomes a neutral business. You earn your cost of capital. So to value R&D, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to first project up the R&D expense each year. So that's the cost. I'm going to multiply the cost by $1.25. That gives me my expected value. worth 318 million. So if I assume R&D earns its cost of capital, its effect completely goes away. I can just focus on what are your existing products, what patents do you have. You add those three numbers up, you get the equivalent of what you get in your discount-free cash flow at the cost of capital in a traditional DCF. There you try to bring in the AVENEX effect into expected growth. Here I'm bringing it in separately. What I'm trying to say? Yes and maybe. Why yes and maybe? Yes, because you get protection against competition from somebody else producing exactly the same product, the product, but it doesn't give you protection from other companies producing their own drugs to treat MS. So if you live in an intensely competitive market, your exclusivity can very quickly start But I'm not comfortable fully monetizing it because option pricing models require replication arbitrage. Any questions on patents as options? So the option to delay something non-viable becomes viable. You develop it. You make money. It could, of course, never become viable, in which case you lose what you paid to get the patent. Let's take a second example of an option to delay. You have an oil company. The oil company has developed reserves. In fact, if you ask me to draw the payoff diagram, here's what it's going to look like. The cost of developing the reserve is going to become the equivalent of the strike price. You will do it only if the value of the oil under the ground exceeds that cost. And if that never happens, what do you lose? How do you get those reserves in the first place? You either did exploration or you bid at auctions for them. Whatever you paid for it is now gone. That's a to become the S in the model, the traditional DCF. What's the exercise price? The cost of actually developing the reserve. What is that cost going to be? Well, it depends on what part of the world you're getting the oil out of the ground from. So I've got S, I've got K, I've got sigma. My risk-free rate kind of falls out of whatever life I attach to the option. But what's the life of this option? How long do I get a reserve for? So I get the rights to develop reserve. Is it in perpetuity? Used to be brought into play so let's say you work at exxon mobil oil prices go to 150 dollars ground, you're saying maybe oil price will be back to $60 before that happens. On both dimensions, you worry about that's a development lag. So let's apply this on an oil company. Let's see if we can devalue the undeveloped reserves in an oil company using this approach. The company I'm going to target is a company called Gulf Oil. Major oil company in the 1980s, and I'll tell you why I had to go all the way back to the 1980s to pick a company to value using this approach. It was targeted in There is a lag. If you decide to develop it, it will take about two years before the oil actually comes out of the ground. But here's the fact that that's going to give the optionality. The oil prices, which are at $22.38 per barrel right now, could change. How much? The variance in oil prices that you can observe by looking at traded oil over the last few years is 0.03, which means the oil price could go higher, it could go lower. That's going to drive the value of the option. multiply by 1538, that's what I make per barrel. And because I have to wait two years, I don't get the first two years of cash flows, I'm going to take out the effect of the first two years. It looks like this, but I'm taking out the first two years of cash flow. What I get is the present value of the oil under the ground is 42.38 billion. It will cost me 30.38 billion to develop these reserves. If I stop right there and ask you for a DCF value for these reserves, So I want to pause right there. This seems almost magical. I took a DCF value of $12 billion for the reserves. Is everybody clear on where I got the $12 billion? It's just the 42.38 minus the 30.38. That was my DCF value. I'm now arguing that these reserves are worth $13.3 billion. Where's the extra $1.3 billion in value coming from in the option pricing model? Where's the extra $1.3 billion? is translate to higher value. What option pricing models tell you, it's not just the level of oil price that matters, but how volatile those prices are. Here's your best case scenario for value for an oil company. You want oil prices to be high and volatile. What's your worst case scenario? Low and boring. What happened in the 1980s and 90s? Oil price went to 25 and hardly moved. You wondered why there was even a market. It was always $25 a barrel. That's a good, it's a quite, what I'm also not factoring in is there's an inflation factor that will affect the prices. So I'm kind of hoping they kind of offset. That's why I said if I could do this right, what I'd have to do is take the 3.038 billion barrels, produce based on capacity, say 150 million barrels every year for the next 20 years, get an expected oil price, discount back at cost of capital. I've kind of cut through all those steps because that would be the way I numbers up, you got the value of an oil company. Would I do this for a Royal Dutch? Not really, it doesn't make sense. But if you gave me a small oil company that's getting the bulk of its value from undeveloped reserves, or a small gold mining company, or any kind of natural resource company, you're going to see this player. So let's spot on natural resource companies, let's what you worry about. Can we apply an option pricing model? This is about as close to being able to do it as we're going to get, right? What can value it based on rental income and come up with a value. Every New York City building, that value is going to have an option premium on it. Why? Because land in Manhattan is scarce. Why? Because it's an island. Don't do this in Kansas City. It's not going to be much less optionality in that building. So something in real estate that you don't think about as an option, but does come into play when people decide how much to pay. got a bad project, it gives you a right to another really bad project. Why would I do it? The second project is an option. It's an option where you can choose to expand or not expand. And if you think about what you're looking at here, it's the underlying project. The present value of the cash flows in that project become the equivalent of the underlying asset. The investment you need to make to expand becomes the equivalent of the strike price. You will expand only if the present value discount the cash flow, you come up with 115 million as your DCF. You're done, right? But wait, this antivirus company, as it's selling its products, it's also collecting data from its customers. That data can be used to create potentially a database business in the future. How long in the future? Any time over the next five years. So you ask me, well, how lucrative is that business? standard deviation in database businesses is 50%. It's a very, very, very volatile business. And that's what's going to drive the value of the option. The risk-free rate is 3%. So I plug the numbers in. As I said, the numbers don't look pretty. The present value, 40 million for 10 years at 12% is 226 million. It costs you a half a billion to enter the business. What's the net present value? Minus, and it dropped. It dropped to, I think, $133 per share. I valued it that time. The blog post is somewhere out there. You can check it out. I came up with a value of $135 per share. Fairly undervalued, right? Now, what's the rule in investing? You need a margin of safety to invest. them as online advertising you haven't figured out what to do next or you haven't don't want to do it right now but there's clearly optionality retail products entertainment news whatever i'm not going to try to value it as an option too messy too many inputs to get but essentially it means a 135 i get is a bare bones absolute flow value that that's going to be on top of the 135 what makes platform companies interested? Because let's face it, the smaller platform companies, Zoom, Peloton, Uber, Lyft, have all had a really tough 18 months. You could argue that you're now getting these companies at their core business value of perhaps a little more. You might even be paying a little more than their core business value. But these are still immense platforms. There are 123 million people on the Uber they know a great deal about your exercise habits more than you probably want them to know. So while you go around telling people, I exercise 40 minutes a day, Peloton's like, you don't. You were standing on that treadmill this morning for 27 minutes reading something. I can tell right here. But there is a degree. So the more exclusive the data they collect on the people on the platform, the more option value there is to that platform. They didn't use the word option, but they said, we have a platform, which effectively means we'll think of something to do with all this data we're collecting. The only promise, the only data that Align collects on you is where you got on the bike and where you got off the bike. It's location information. Location information, I mean, I remember when this came out, I pulled out my iPhone and tracked how many apps knew where I was. The apps knew more about where I was than I myself knew. with an option pricing model. The reason I'm trying to value the option at Facebook is I could make up numbers, put an S and a K, but nothing is replicable here. I can't trade the underlying asset. I can trade the option. It's kind of an exercise in futurity. So all I can say, it's large as a number, but I don't know how big. And that's why I would not do this as a justification if I'm buying Facebook at twice my estimated value. Then I'm asking for trouble. But to the extent that't look like it's working. It's nice to be able to walk away, abandon the investment, and get back, you know, let's say you can get back only half your original investment. You're going to regret what you did, but I've given you a floor on how much you can lose. you decide to work through the numbers of this joint venture. And based on your estimates, let's say you come up with the present value of the cash flows of 480 million. So you have to invest 500 million, you get back 480 million. That's a net present value of minus 20 million. So you come back to me and say, no, we're not interested. But I really, really, really want you to be a joint venture partner, to offer you a sweet million. I'm giving you this option. I want this option to be worth at least 20 million for you to become a partner. So here's what the numbers look like. The S becomes the 480 million. Present value of the cash flows today. The K becomes what you will get if you walk away from this deal, which is 400 million. Is this an in-the-money option or out-of-the-money option? that's why you are reluctant to become a joint venture partner. I've now offered you an option to abandon, which is worth $73 million. You add the two numbers up. That basically means you're more likely. It doesn't guarantee it because I can't force you to become a joint venture partner. You can now see why when joint venture negotiations, one of the sweeteners that gets thrown in to attract people you want into the joint venture is these options to be able to walk away. to year seven there's only 23 and you get to year 29 how many years of cash flows are there left one more year so you know what you're going to do you're going to collect all the cash flows or the project is good on the 364th day of the 30th year you're going to show up and say i never liked this project i would like my 400 million dollars back so that's why i had to cut the abandonment option off much earlier than the project ends because otherwise you wait till the very last moment collect 400 million dollars and get expected cash flows today. Let's say one year in, you're not selling as many commercial aircraft as you intend. You revisit that present value? That's the variance I'm computing in the cash flows is things may change in the business. So it means that when you're a company, especially if you're a company that has a lot of long-term projects, some of the things you're taught to do might not be the right things to do. For instance, optionality. What that means is when things went better than expected, they found ways to augment it. And when things were going worse than expected, they always seemed to find a way to weasel out before everybody else discovered. Maybe having one of you as the head of the Treasury might tell, no, but whatever it is, they had that reputation. It's gone now. But there was a point in time when Goldman traded at a premium over other investment banks precisely because they were viewed as when traveling like some parts because I I'm here. that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",
