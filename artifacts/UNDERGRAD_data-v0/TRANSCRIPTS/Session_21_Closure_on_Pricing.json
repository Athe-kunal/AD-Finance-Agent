{"text": " Thank you. I remember we're in session 21 which means the end of the session will be 75 percent of the way done with this class which is my indirect way of nagging you saying if you've not started on your you know project get started because there are a few of you've never sent me a dcf i have no idea whether you even picked a company and i've given up trying so if you do finish a dc Those are the questions you're going to ask me, right? So think of it as if somebody's trying to sell me shares on a price to book ratio, what are the three, four questions? That's the end game. So we're going to come back and talk about reviewing that. But I want to start today with something that each of you potentially could face at the end of this project phase and you price your company to software company against other software companies, and you come up with a pricing that's the right word but you call it a valuation let's call it, say $20. You're faced with a quandary right. Is the stock overvalued which is what your DCF tells you it is, is it under priced or kept asking you to use the word priced when you did pricing? Because it's undervalued. It's in this case, underpriced and overvalued. Both statements are true. Today, I'm going to give you a couple of examples with companies I valued already in this class that I'll price again and come up with a very different conclusion and say, I'm okay with these. market you know how can you get two different pricings depending who you compare it to you know what it's telling you though right the fact is if you get a ten dollar pricing against the market and a twenty dollar pricing against the software sector that tells you about how the market's pricing software companies because if it pushes up the pricing of every software company when you price a company against other software companies you're going to feed it in we were just So don't let this page intimidate you. So remember the last class I did, P ratios, peg ratios, price-to-book ratios, EV to EBITDA, EV to SES, right? With each one I did the algebra. Think of this as kind of a cheat sheet of every conceivable multiple. So you've got at the top equity multiples where I started the dividend discount model, telling the drivers of the equity multiples, enterprise value multiples. I started with an enterprise value model, work up. So it's basically a cheat sheet of everything we did assuming the correctly price, which is always the case, but we're also assuming that they all look roughly the same in terms of growth and cash flows risk, we're cheating, right? Because we don't know how to control for all software companies. Is that true? 40 years ago it was probably true, sectors were homogeneous. Today you take the software sector, who's that, who of the things you're going to face once you've got that list of 15, 20, 25, or 30 companies is there will be differences between your company and those companies. Differences on growth, differences in cash flow, differences in risk. You have to control for those differences. Right now, you know how equity research has control for those differences? They tell stories. Like what? My stock has a PE of 18. changes and multiple changes but about how much so let's start with the basic choice so this weekend you say okay i'm going to do pricing you have to find comparable companies right how many of you and i want an honest answer have access capital iq it doesn't work for you okay so you need to talk to it about it screen based on geography. I want to look at only U.S. companies. You go and click U.S. companies. It'll come back with 19,000 U.S. companies. Obviously, you don't want 19,000 companies in your sample. You say, I want software companies in the U.S. You click software companies. It'll come back with 1,300 software companies. and they said they went into building retail. So retail, they picked the building retail. It makes sense. And then they picked, because Home Depot is a big company, market cap rated at $200 billion. And they got a sample size of one. You know what the sample size of one was, right? They got Home Depot. This doesn't help. You can't compare Home Depot to Home Depot. So here's a choice you're going to have to face. Do you want to define your criteria to find companies just like yours and end up with a small sample? Great. GM, Ford, and Chrysler. That's all you had. You had history. And all the analysts, they immersed themselves in the three companies and they developed rules of thumb. You know, GM traded a PE ratio 25% higher than Ford, and then they would make pricing judgments. Three companies. So if you're going to just do this eyeballing, I would understand each equation. But the consequence, of course, was you created a horrendous multiple in terms of being able to explain it. And there's a fortune. Open up your statistics book. We already did last session, right, when you talked about iterations across countries. Statistics, as I mentioned in the last class, was designed to do exactly this. Control for difference across countries. They're watching a commercial for their champagne, I think gives you a headache. It comes around Christmas every year. Now, really cheap champagne, dollar for a whole bottle. It's like trade a dose for a dollar one. But I think that's drinkable. This is not. Really cheap champagne. Second is Star Hunter. And the third is Hansen. Star Hunter, I have no idea what they even do. I think some kind of whiskey that only a few people drink or something like that. And Hansen Natural, of course. It's the third column I've given, right? They have the highest risk. I miss, I mean, and that's what I mean about sloppy pricing. As often you see analysts, the data will be staring them in the face and they're still looking at PE ratios. They, hey, how come you're not looking at growth and risk? I'm not saying that, you know, Hanson could not be cheap, but I'm saying you need to control for difference in growth and risk. And by not controlling for them, I'm essentially waving my hand companies were privatized. In other words, they went public companies. And many of those companies decide to list in the U.S. and have ADRs. ADRs are basically those companies traded in the U.S. The nice thing about ADRs is your earnings have to be restated using GAAP, which is a big deal in that time because you're a different accounting standard. So there's my sector and there's the PE ratio for each of these companies. I'm still naive that firing didn't cure the naive day, so I pick That's one thing that's the better. You know what the other is? These are all telecom ADRs, but there's a mix of telecom ADRs. Indosat and Telebras are emerging market, but you also have the Danish telecom company, the Deutsche Telekom company, you have some developed market telecom companies, and this was in an age when emerging markets were really much riskier than developed. So if you're asking just qualitative questions, one thing you worry about is the low growth, database and it's an emerging market telecom company i put a one and a developed market company i put a zero i ran the regression against the growth rate and the emerging market dummy variable so let's see what this regression does let's take the constant 13.12 what does that tell me it tells me how the entire sector is being priced sectors being priced higher right now if i did this for ai i'd start with a large intercept because everybody's priced out so it kind of actually worse than that. We have two companies, two telecom companies. So let's be very clear. This is just telecom specific. It's about the sector. They have the same growth rate for late 90s, but one is an emerging market telecom company. The other is a developed market telecom company. The emerging market telecom companies' PE is 13.85, not 0.1385, 13.85 lower. So the first company is a PE of 45. The second company is going to have a PE of 11.15. At 8.9 times earnings, Stellar Brass is actually slightly overpriced, not underpriced, after I adjust for its low growth and its emerging market status. Same thing with Indosat. It looks cheap, but if you bring in its very low growth, the fact that an emerging market company becomes overpriced. What I've essentially done is taken the hand-waving and said, you know what, let's use statistics to quantify the effect, bring it in, and actually look at the price outlier out, guess what you find? A second outlier, a third outlier, and a fourth outlier. Before you're done, you've taken all the things that are explaining differences across companies and ended up with seven companies that look alike. So I know, but that often happens, right? So you don't know what the gaming has been on data before somebody sells you something. But it is susceptible. I won't call it susceptible. If you have bias, you're going to be a function of how many companies you have in your sample. If you have four companies, don't even run a regression. Don't show me regression coefficients. It's pointless. You need at least 10. You can get away with maybe 9, 9, 10. If you do regression with 9 or 10 companies, you can run, you can have one independent variable. If you have 20 companies, you can have two. For every 10 companies in your sample, use a default but even that's too much work for me i'm too lazy to go look up default spreads i could use the rating you know but it's an alphabet and stuff to put an alphabet into it remember those prs those risk scores we talked about nowhere you can look at you you can get that for 160 countries it's a number you put it in and it'll give you a continuous measure of countries so today we actually can do things we could not have done across companies in the late other banks. So I get fired at the telecom. It's not because I ran the regression, but because I refused to run the regression. I landed on my feet. I'm now the European bank analyst. These are my companies and my sample. Most of them I can't even pronounce and I'm not even going to try. But I got the price to book ratios. You know why people like to use price to book ratios for banks? What is it about banks that makes their book values more meaningful? Return on equity. So I pulled up the return on equity because when you did the algebra, you remember that popped out as a first sentence. I got the return on equity. And then I threw in a proxy for risk. I threw in the standard deviation in stock prices, but in hindsight, I wish I'd used a risk measure more specific to banking. Remember, you've left the intrinsic value arena. There is no should be, could be. So you can't talk about beta. Is that the only way of thinking? This is all done. what percentage of a bank's assets are in long-term bonds. I could throw that in as a risk measure, right? Because that's what is worrying investors now. My point is, when you think about risk in a sector, be creative. Think about what in this sector people worry about. You want to bring in a prospect. So here I'm going to stay with the standard deviation. And my initial try, I'm going to eyeball. This is a very dangerous practice because my eyes start to glaze over after a while. But what am I looking for in a cheap bank here? There wasn't a single stock that met all three. Am I surprised? Not really. There's no, unless it's an obvious mispricing. And if I'm looking for an overvalued stock, I'm looking for stocks that are price-to-book ratios higher than the median, returns and equity lower than the median, and standard deviation higher. Try that out. A good starting point for pricing is get the companies in your sector, compute the medians, and look for companies that fall below or above and look for, is it something obvious to misprice? what you expected it to be. It's negative or positive instead of negative or negative instead of positive. We'll talk about why that happens. Here, higher return equity companies, higher price to book ratios, and riskier companies of lower price to book ratios. The R-squared, 79%, small sample. I'm not going to get overjoyed, but it's still a pretty decent R-squared sample. And if you take every bank in here, I can make sense. Every 1% increase in my return equity If I had an R squared of 100%, my predictions would be perfect, right? With an R squared of 79%, that predicted price to book is going to have a range, 0.86 to 0.92. If the R squared were 20%, the range is going to get bigger. So what I'm trying to say is, if you get an R squared of 20%, don't give up. It doesn't mean you cannot use the regression. It just means you get a bigger range. And the bigger range means you will not be able to reject the hypothesis that the stock is correctly priced. they've given up on my capacity to look at sector. You don't know enough about this. Still have the cheapest stocks, 100 largest market cap stocks. Now, this is actually a challenge, right? 100 largest market cap stocks in the US have banks, they have technology companies, they have manufacturing companies, they have retail companies, all in their place. So I wanted to pick a multiple which I could use across the companies. When you have no idea what it's going to fit it's a the three and you tell me whether they share anything in common because it might give me a clue as to what I'm missing in the scatterplot. The three most overpriced stocks are Google, Infosys, and Gilead, a young pharmaceutical company. So whenever you see three companies and you see a common character, the reason you look is maybe there's a missing variable. That's why they look cheap. What do they share in common? companies. Red flags should go off already. You know why they looked underpriced? Because oil companies are using return equity. I'm using last year's net income. And 2010 happened to be when net income had bounced back. The return on equity had gone up. But markets were not being stupid and pricing them based on that net income. Basically, I've explained the way. You said, why did you even waste your time with this scatterplot? I'm going to explain the way that was pricing. The 100 largest market cap stocks. about and they make me dizzy whenever I look. You got price to book, return equity and growth. It's like, think of it like a cardboard box, right? I want you to tell me where in this box your cheapest stocks can be found. I'll help you. You want low price to book or high price to book? Low price to book. You want high growth or low growth? High growth. And you want low return equity or high return equity? I think, pragmatic way of doing this. What's the most you can fit into the scatterplot? I think three dimensions are about all you can fit. I've never seen a four dimensional graph. Actually I have, in fact, the way they did was they do a dozen three dimensional graphs with different, so it actually is like this, there's 12 different three dimensional graphs. They're very pretty, but I have no idea how to use them actually. right direction. Higher beta stocks have lower price to book ratios. Makes sense? That makes sense. Higher growth stocks have higher price to book ratios. And higher return equity stocks have so deep sigh of relief. These are the signs. Next up, check to see whether the variables statistically explain much. Go to the t-statistic and basically as you look across the t-'s not what you should, you think should belong there. It's based on what the market's actually pricing. And if I use this regression, I can get a predicted price-to-book ratio every single company. I usually update these 100 largest market cap regressions every year. This year, I'll be too lazy to do it. I should do it someday soon. But this was my 2022 update. overpriced enough to fall outside the range. So I get fired as the market, 100 largest market cap company. So I thought I did a good job, but I guess they didn't like it. And they put me, so now they're moving me to more and more boring sectors. This is their vision of punishment. So they moved me to becoming analyst for the trucking sector. I can't get any worse than this. So I moved to the sector, and now they asked me to use EV to have it done, because that's what we use. recommendation by writer system it trades at 2.8 times habitat you're going to play devil's ad ask me the questions i we should we saw what drove you to have it down right you remember the variables so what yuki tax rate so so the question is what's the tax rate if i told you to write a system with an 80 tax rate and everybody else is and that would have settled the problem because it turned out that writer systems are the oldest fleet in the center. You're saying so what it looks see you go buy the stock four weeks later That's what I mean about sloppy pricing. I have no problem with using EV to EBITDA, but at least have the good sense to control for the differences and ask the right questions. Because then I can buy into your pricing. So after my ill-fated rider systems recommendation, I get fired again. What's even more boring than trucking companies? Grocery stores. Is anybody valuing the grocery store? catapult and guess what most of them behave very well they fit in between the two lines and there is this outlier you know what that is that's a first coming of old foods kind of blue grocery store analyst minds right because here was a grocery store where they charged four times as much for eggplant and then offered you food said you know you felt rich you bought and you didn't feel rich regression of price to sales against net margins for just grocery stores, plugged in Whole Foods margin, 3.4%, which is higher than the industry average, and I got a predicted price to sales of 0.43. What does that mean? Even after I control for its higher margin, it should be trading at 0.43 times revenues, it's trading at 1.9 times revenues, total price, even with the margins. Then I lost interest in Whole Foods, I tend to lose interest quickly in these things. and Garrett is back again above the line. It's like watching a manic-depressive in action, right? You need some mood swings kind of adjuster somewhere in there. But that's what happens when you get a new player in a business and people don't understand it. They don't get it right. They overshoot, they undershoot, they overshoot, they undershoot. I actually tracked Whole Foods through 2013, and in 2013, it fell right on the line. And I said, okay, finally, they get it. you know that what would you ever heard of sprout sprouts is a west coast base it's like a it's like a hippie version of whole foods you know that's i mean it used to be a store called henry's we had big bins you could get food out of so they're like you know you don't like whole foods because you feel it's full of yuppies you can come to losing companies kind of right i think of uber it's still young it's money losing so quite a few of you doctor now i've given you all these nice pictures where things fit and you put in the right variables you get an r squared that's reasonable you can make predictions i'm going to get you ready for aaunted, I ran the regression anyway. And I wasn't surprised. The R squared I got was 4%. But here's an even scarier number. See that coefficient on net margin? Minus 7.54. How would I read that? The more negative your net margin, the higher your price-to-sales ratio. Now, some dot-com companies took that to heart, right? You lost a billion. We can lose two. You lose one. this catapulting, it's not going to work. So there are two tricks I'm going to pull out of my back pocket, my front pocket or whichever pocket, and you can use either one and see if it works for you. The first is to think about what investors in this sector think about when they price companies. And I'll give you what my thought process is with dot-com companies. People were buying dot-com companies because they wanted growth. So I said, I want to focus on revenue growth saying higher revenue growth companies should have higher multiples. And finally, I looked at cash as a percent of revenues. And what's that capture? You think of how young companies fail. It's not because they can't make a debt payment, it's because they run out of cash. So my argument was the more cash a company has on hand, the less likely it is to fail. In fact, equity if I rerun it, I take it out. I took Amazon's numbers and plugged them into this regression. So I plugged in Amazon's revenues, Amazon's growth rate, Amazon's cash as a percentage. And I got a predicted price to sales ratio for Amazon of 30.42. It was actually trading at 25.6 times revenues. Based on my pricing, what am I finding for Amazon? drop in the stock price, but it dropped only 80%. You say, what do you mean only 80%? You know what happened to the rest of the dot-com sector? It dropped 95%. So the pricing was right. It was telling you you found the cheapest of these stocks. And so was the valuation. But that's something you need to remember when you do pricing. When you find something to be underpriced, you're just finding an underpriced relative to the five when I have a bigger revenue. And rather than applying a multiple to today's revenues, I'm adjusted for both inflation and risk. The 80 billion is going to become 25 billion. It's a risky company. I mean, that effect is going to be large. What else could affect my value today? To get that $80 billion pricing, what has to happen? The company has to live to year 10, right? he said what happened how did the 69 billion become 8 billion so i actually took my 69 billion and broke it down into how it became 8 billion so the first thing i did was i took the cash flows discounted the back of the risk-free rate and that takes out the time value effect and i discounted with the risk premium built in the cost of capital brought it down even more then i brought it down for the dilution and by the time this was all said and done i said look 69 billion in year 10 valuation. Ultimately, in price, you've got to be in practice, right? The question you're asking is not what should drive the pricing, but what is driving the pricing. I don't want to be mysterious, but we come into preconceptions, especially from the intrinsic value world. Price-earnings ratio should be higher for high-growth companies. It should be lower for riskier companies. But ultimately, the market might care about none of that stuff and be pricing something else the share. At the same time, I wanted to price Twitter. So I went and looked up social media companies that made their money from online advertising. That I define as my comparable group. Those are the companies who are publicly traded. There are the market caps and enterprise values. And then I collected a bunch of accounting data about these companies. What are your revenues, your EBITDA, your EBIT, your net income cap? There you go, number of users. Same thing with enterprise value. Now you and I can say, look, that doesn't make sense. You'd be focusing on cash flows. It doesn't matter. That's what the market is pricing in. That's what you got to play. price Twitter. I went back to the previous page and I computed the app. So I computed the EV divided by users. So EV per user for each company. The median value was about $100 per user across these companies. Why does the number vary across companies? It's like a market estimate of lifetime value of a user. Maybe some companies get more value than others. Twitter had 240 million users on the day it went public. It's so pricey. How much does a user company in the market what do you gain by doing it you get a much bigger sample what do I lose by doing it I have a lot more different companies in my center so about starting about 25 years ago at the. You know, when I look at this graph, and this is the most powerful variable explaining PE ratio, I know when I run my regression, I'm not going to see 80% R squared or 70% R squared or even 50% R squared. I get a 25%. I was actually pleasantly surprised by this 25% R squared because after that plot, I said maybe 12%, maybe 15%. 25% is pretty good. Am I disappointed? measure that's a price of growth in the market that's how much the market is willing to pay for higher growth companies then i looked at beta every increase in beta one increases my p by 2.23 that makes sense high beta companies have what high-risk companies should have lower p if you don't do anything it will be a linear regression so every one percent increase in growth has the same effect as you go one to two two to three so the first thing you worry about are non-linear relationships now at the moment it's an abstraction but with each multiple i'm going to talk about when you worry p and growth it's not a big deal but with peg ratios it's something i'm going to have to deal with what do you do pricing and growth and pricing and risk and pricing and payout change over time, which makes it difficult to keep using regressions without rerunning. And there's a third issue, and this might be something you remember or don't remember from your statistics class, depending on how much you enjoyed it or did not enjoy it. It's what's called multi-collinearity. I remember listening to that in my class. What the heck is that? Why should I care? I should have cared more. what to do with multicollinearity, but something that might explain some of the strange output we get from this regression. In fact, what did I find for beta? That it had a positive coefficient, right? What if high growth companies have high betas? And that tends to be true. What does the computer see when you give it data? You might label the data or whatever, but it sees four columns of numbers, right? So if all your high growth companies have high betas, 0.5, 0.3. Let's get rid of it. It's creating noise in your prediction. It's not worth leaving it. One final point. If you run a traditional regression, whether it's in Excel or whether it's a Minitab in the statistics package that they have, I don't know which package is that. You run a traditional regression, it runs it with a constant, an intercept. And if you get a negative intercept, which you can, it can become a problem if you're using it in pricing. Let's talk about what? best fit line it moves it to go through the origin in other words through zero it's not as good a fit anymore because you move the line but you no longer have a negative intercept problem essentially when you run that intercept less regression the regression output will look like this so this is my p regression for 2023 without the intercept and basically it's still the same three variables i can do the least you can the world that i ran the regression for two at negative intercepts there's nothing i could point to that said this is why it was but for those reasons that regions i re-ran the regression without the aid of constant and finally there's the multilinearity this is actually what's called correlation matrix i took the independent variable and the dependent variables put them on but you can still use the regression to get predicted values. And that's all I care about. I want to use the regression to get predicted PE ratios. So I've never felt the urge to fix that. But if you're a statistics geek, and this is what makes you tick, there are ways you can get around that problem. So I'm going to close off by using this regression to make a prediction. I mean, the whole point of running this market regression was I wanted to use about it? I don't plan to do anything, but if I ran a hedge fund and I built it around this regression, you know what I would do? I would sell short the overpriced stocks and buy the underpriced stocks and get down on my knees and hope and pray that they all move towards", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 150.41], "text": " Thank you.
