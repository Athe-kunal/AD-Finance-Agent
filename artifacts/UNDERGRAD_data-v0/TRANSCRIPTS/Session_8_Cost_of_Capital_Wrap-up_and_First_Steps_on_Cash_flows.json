We're going to have to do a lot of work on the project. We're going to have to do A couple of things before I forget. First is there's no class next Monday. It's a great it's a celebration of President's Day. I'm not even sure what how exactly you celebrate presidency. But I guess I guess we go shopping, big shopping. Do whatever you need to do. class will be a Zoom class. It'll be interesting because, you know, 350 people, which means five, you know, the maximum number of people you can see on a gallery page in Zoom? It's 48. The reason I know it intimately is because I taught this class entirely online one semester, and you keep flipping gallery page to gallery page. But it'll be a Zoom class. The second is, I won't ask you whether you picked a company already, because I will assume from this point on, an email from somebody who shall remain unnamed saying I'm in your class I've been reading your emails is that enough for the class can I just read your emails and will I keep up with the class I wish my emails were that productive and but I understand you have a life to live you have other classes to take I don't know why you take all those other classes but you have other classes to take I think you need the credits should prepare for the quiz at least every three weeks or so you should be spending you know maybe at least take four quizzes and then i go three to six hours six to ten and if you're really obsessed with the class and you're willing to say who needs sleep i have 15 weeks i can spend every moment on valuation i give you value a romco. What do you value? You're valuing Saudi Arabia, right? Why? Because 80% of Saudi Arabia's GDP comes from oil and a romco of the class, because that would be a pity. So with that long lead in, let's talk about cash flows and earnings. Today, we're going to leave discount rates behind. And I'm glad we will be. Because in discounted cash flow valuation, and remember you are valuing your company as of right now so please don't turn in valuations as of january 1st 2023 it doesn't help me in the least telling me that you'd have bought a stock on january 1st 2023 is completely useless you can't go back in time and do it so you're going to be valuing company on march 7th you know's once every quarter. So you want updated accounting numbers. The only problem is those numbers don't. And if you're stuck with annual reports, they update once a year. So given that we want updated earnings numbers, I'm going to ask you how to compute those updated numbers. And I'm going to give you four choices to come up with updated earnings for your company. got lucky. But Aramco was September 30th, 2022. You can go with the last 10K and say, what choice do I have? But the last 10K for you might be 2021's 10K. You can multiply the last quarter's earnings by four. You think that's a good idea? Technically, it makes a quarter into a year. What's the problem multiplying the last quarter's earnings by four? 2023, Mike, you're being consistent. You know how you're being consistent? You're using the most updated numbers you can for every single input. And the case of accounting, unfortunately, that input is going to be a lagged input. And if you really, if even that makes you uncomfortable, then you can try to fill in that quarter that's missing, get a forecasted number. The only problem with forecasted numbers is analysts don't forecast every item. You might be able to get this for earnings, but not for revenues. cash flows. And I'll give you the standard equation, earnings plus depreciation minus CapEx minus change in working capital. Here's where there can be an issue with what you've been taught in accounting and what we have to think about here. I'll give you the big definition of CapEx that accounting claims to estimate. A capital expenditure is any expenditure that capex reflects true capex, the land, the building they sell. Technology company, though, you have R&D expenses, pharmaceutical company. Does R&D expense meet the big picture criterion for capex? The question I'm asking is, do companies do R&D to get benefits this year, or do you think they do R&D to get benefits over the future? It's like super capex, right? A pharmaceutical company that does R&D this year, if it's lucky, might get revenues 10 years from now. Many of them are not advertising to go, you know, Budweiser, Super Bowl ad since I don't know how long. They don't expect you to, maybe they do. Some of you might go and say, I need six pack of Budweiser right now, I just saw the ad. The reality is some of this is to build a brand name, to build an image that will pay off if you're lucky in long term growth. You could argue that some or a big chunk of the There were very few service companies. It worked fine in the 1940s and the 50s and the 60s. It is beyond getting frayed right now. It's just broken. Because you look at the 10 largest market cap companies in the world. There isn't a single manufacturing company on the list. Of the top 25, there's one manufacturing company that makes the list. The rest are service companies, technology companies, pharmaceutical companies, financial service companies. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So we're talking about the cost of debt few last loose ends and discount rates let's complete. What do we say the cost of it somebody repeat back to me what we're trying to estimate with the cost of debt. First, is it long term or short term. have subsidized it. Incidentally, to get to a cost of debt, you need default spread. So we'll come back to that. But basically, we ended with synthetic ratings. That's where I left you off. And the synthetic ratings give you default spreads and default spreads change over time. And you want the most updated spreads you can get. If you look at my website, you'll get the spreads at the start of 2023. But I'll also send you a link where you can check it at the start of every month. They update the spreads. Great site. Free. That cost of debt I had for the company was 9.25% based on, remember how we built up to, we started with a risk-free rate, then we added a default spread for Embraer and then a default spread for Brazil. 9.25% is the rate you would charge them based on their risk. The Brazilian government has lent to them at 6% below market rates. You're trying to compute a cost of capital to use to value Embraer. forever, right? And we know subsidies kind of dissipate over time. Governments pull that. So the problem with using 6% forever is I might be understating my cost of capital, even after it's become a more normal cost of capital. If I use the 9.25% as my cost of debt, what's a mistake I'm making? I'm missing the benefits I get from the subsidized debt, right? Because it is nice to have debt at 6% when you should be paying 9.25%. So in a sense, financial statements, you could maybe weight how much they get from government. Which is a variation of the same theme, which is take the weights, change the weights over time. When you borrow money, forget about it. Let's say your actual cost of debt is 9% and somebody lends you, let's say you have $100 million you borrow at 6% when you should be paying 9%. It's a 10-year law. Is there a way for you get from the government. So you get these prices, they're higher than, and this is true around the world, US farmers get a subsidy. So I value the subsidy from getting that higher price. But in return for the subsidy, the sugar manufacturers are required to sell a portion of your value comes from the business and how much is coming from subsidy any questions on subsidized debt yes what you mean i said this what rate do you use to discount you'd actually use your 9.25 percent rate Use that as your period of the subsidy and assume after that term, you're not going to get re-upped. It's probably the most sensible thing to do in that. So we have a cost of debt that reflects the rate at which you could borrow money. So let me bring this all together for Embraer, because I've been talking about Embraer off and on. I talked about equity last session using global averages. So 1.07 is a levered beta for Embraer based on global aerospace companies. The 4% was the implied equity risk premium for the S&P 500, a mature market premium. You're saying, where's Brazil? It's in that extra 7.89% premium. This was a time when Brazil was considered a very risky equity. The dollar cost of equity I have for Embraer is 10.7%. Everybody with me so far? Risk-free rate in US dollars, beta from a bottom of beta, mature market premium being the implied premium for the S&P 500, the lambda and the country risk premium mopping up bringing in the country risk. Let's move to the cost of debt. I'll come back to the market values in a while. Start with the same risk-free rate. As a general rule, when you do cost of capital, your starting point for the rating lots of moving pieces all coming together in one calculation what's the last thing i need i need weights i'll state the first principle here the weights in a cost of capital calculation should be market value weights I don't have a problem in most companies doing that, but if you're doing Bed Bath and Beyond right now, do you think there might be a difference rate, right? So the market interest rate goes up, the price of the bond drops. I'm going to draw on bond pricing to revalue the book value of debt. So here's what you have. When you see debt on a balance sheet, that's like the face value of all the debt you have due, right? If you go to the income statement, you see interest expenses, that's like the coupon you're paying on the debt. And if you dig a little deeper in the footnotes, you'll probably also see a measure of when the debt comes due. So let's assume that you1 billion. Not a huge difference, but I've converted book debt to market debt. It's not going to make a huge difference in this calculation, but you can see that by doing that, my weights become 16% equity, 84% debt, and my weighted average of cost of capital is 9.97%. So if you have book debt, you want to convert it to market debt. if the coupon rate is lower than the market interest rate, you're using exactly the same mechanics used for bond pricing to convert book value of debt to market value of debt. So all of these calculations, this is the end game. That becomes the cost of capital you'd use to value Embraer if you're doing a valuation in US dollar terms. Any questions? Why do you guys look shell-shocked? to get the number that I got. Try it out when you get a chance. Essentially, it's a present value problem that I'm solving, treating all of the debt as if. So you could compute. Let's say you get there with your company, right? You will. You don't have to assume. You will get there, even if I have to drag you there. Let's say you come up with a dollar cost of capital for your company. Why? Because you decided you wanted to do dollar convert a dollar cost of capital into a nominal real cost of capital. Take one plus the dollar cost of capital, adjust for the inflation effect. That's a 1.08. Now, if you're in a hurry, you can just add the 6% onto your dollar cost of capital. You get companies might issue them. What do you get with a convertible bond? Who's you? First, let's be clear. The buyer of the bond gets a bond. the rest is debt. So if you have a convertible bond, you can break it up into its debt and equity components because leaving it as a hybrid leaves a mess, right? Because you have debt, you have equity, then you have a convertible bond, which is neither fish nor fowl. So if you have convertible debt, you can actually take the convertible debt, break it down into its debt and equity components. How am I going to do that? And remember what he said, like if you held the convertible bond, kept it as a bond, what are you going to get? Coupons and face value, right? see what portion is equity, what portion is debt. I'll actually break it down mechanically and send it to you when I send my email after the class, so you can see how much of a convertible bond is debt net. There's another type of hybrid that gives me nightmares. I hate it. It's called preferred stock. Preferred stock in Latin America is really regulated based on regulatory capital. And for whatever reason, the regulatory authorities have decided to treat preferred stock as equity. So what it allows banks to do is issue debt and at the same time see their equity go up. The only problem is it's very expensive debt, I promised you an email, but I actually did this. So let me show you how a convertible bond can be broken down. This is actually a convertible bond with a face value of 125 million and a 4% coupon rate. Usually convertible bonds will have very low coupon rates because you're giving people a conversion option. The convertible bond is 91.4 million into debt. My prom goes away. I no longer have a hybrid to worry about. I've gone back to just debt and equity. That won't work for preferred stock, but at least for convertible debt, that option is there. Don't worry. Most of you will not have convertible debt in your financials. This is a very selective problem that some of you will have. The tax rate you're multiplying it by reflects the tax benefits you get from borrowing. And I'm going to introduce two different tax rates you're going to run into in this class and in finance that I want you to keep separate. The first is called an effective tax rate. The second is a marginal tax rate. The first is what you see in financial statements. You know, you open up Capital IQ, you open up your 10K, you make you feel pissed off. They'll say, congratulations. This year, you paid 28.33% of your adjusted gross income in taxes. And here's what they do. They take your taxes paid and divide by, be glad if you get 28, but if you work in the New York area, it's going to be more like 47.53% or 56.22%. They take your taxes that are coming to you, divide by adjusted gross income. They're doing an effective tax rate of 16, 17, 18%. The marginal tax rate of 25%. The marginal tax rate of 25% is the same for every company which makes money. Because you get to that 25% very well. You subtract out the $100,000. You have taxable income of $900,000 on which you pay taxes, right? Think of where you saved on taxes. It wasn't on the first $100,000. It wasn't on the middle $100,000. It was on the last $100,000. That tax rate is going to be much higher than what you paid on the first $100,000. But that's the tax rate that you should be using for your after-tax cost of debt because you save taxes at the margin. and work backwards. Think of this like a web page. We click and you go to a bigger page because you start with the detail. It's very easy to get lost. Think of the big picture what you're trying to estimate with the cost of capital. Any questions on cost of capital? So let's talk about estimating cash flows. Did I get the right picture? operating income. Why? Because you're looking at a pre-debt number. Net income is after. You subtract out the taxes now from the operating income that you would have paid if the entire operating income had been taxed. So basically, your starting points are different. Net income in one case, after-tax operating income in the next. With both cash flows, you subtract out what you're going to put back into the firm. And I'm going to talk about three items here that will go in. One is depreciation, what is depreciation or items we've got to deal with, but that's the end game. So let's start with each of these cash flow calculations and set the process up. Each of the cash flow calculations, we're going to start with earnings number, right? Net income in one, operating income in the other. Of course, we trust the accountants. You're going to get traditional CapEx land building equipment. But I'm going to argue, think wider. If you're a technology company, that R&D expenditure it's incurring is CapEx. If you're Uber or Netflix, what's your biggest CapEx? Where does your value come from? Having more subscribers, having more writers, right? So what's the analogous CapEx? How do you get those new writers? bring in how much are the cash flows from and to debt. Now, along the way, you're going to see multiple ways of getting free, especially when you start working through past quizzes. You're going to say there are hundreds of ways of getting free cash flow. Not really. It's the algebra kind of working in different ways. I'd start with the traditional definition of free cash flow. After-tax EBIT plus depreciation minus ca after-tax operating income. So instead of telling you there's $100 million in after-tax operating income and I'm reinvesting $30 million, I can say I have a reinvestment rate of 30%. Am I changing the equation? No, I'm just restating it. So what I'm trying to say is when you see these different variants show up, they're basically trying to get to the same endgame. I'm not giving you three different free cash flow firms. I'm still trying to get to the same end place. I discount them, I discount them back at a cost of capital. What goes into cost of capital? Cost of equity and after tax cost of debt. My tax benefits of debt are already in my discount rate. If I count the same tax benefits and increase my cash flows, I'll be double counting. Three in 10 discounted cash flow valuations I see double count the tax benefits from interest expenses. They just subtract the actual taxes paidvestment includes. So don't ask me, where's the working capital change? Where are the acquisitions? It should all be consolidated by number. We do it for convenience so that when we do projections, we're not projecting at five line items. We're projecting one line item. Before the class, what's your saw so much confusion and how people were computing free cash flows that I said, okay, let's take a company apart so we can see what the numbers look like. So this is from Microsoft. I'm not suggesting there's anything special you learn from it, but essentially to illustrate how we get from after-tax operating income to free cash flow. So let's start with free cash flow equity. There's What operating income, what tax rate, what capex, what depreciation, what working capital. But as you know, don't get lost in the details. Step back and think about what we're trying to do. We're trying to get to a free cash flow to the firm calculation. And all of these details are essentially helping us get there. You guys look like you're ready for a long weekend, so I'm not going to companies last year were? Oil companies made a lot of money last year, especially with trailing 12-month numbers. Why were trailing 12-month earnings for oil companies so high last year? Because oil prices between October of 2021 and September of 2022 were high. If I take those trailing 12-month numbers for Nexon, Mobil or Royal Dutch and let them grow at 3% a year from now on, I'm going to overvalue these companies. is this accounting issue that I talked about, that accountants are not always consistent about the way they classify expenses. That there's one financial expense that they routinely used to categorize as an operating expense that finally, thank God, they fixed. What am I talking about? 2019 accountants came to their senses. Leases. I'm going to talk about why leases have always been debt. In the 30 plus years I've been reporting numbers, I've always treated leases as debt. magical year if you can get four quarters of earnings put together. You're going to get lucky because for many of you by next month, you should be getting your annual report. But for some of your companies, remember, year ends don't always have to be December 30th, right? If you're valuing, I think Disney is what, September 30th of each year. So if you have a company whose year end is September, God help you because you're'm going to expand the discussion because it's not just about leases. It's about any expense that looks like leases. And guess what? There are quite a few of those that you might have to factor in when you value a company. So I'm going to talk about how to convert an operating expense into a financial expense. Accountants do that for you with leases, but you can take you through the process. You can see it's not rocket science. so if you have a contractual claim as opposed to residual claim you're going to treat it said so bank debt obviously debt corporate bonds obviously debt help me out again if you sign a lease agreement you're you're a retailer you sign a 10-year lease at a store are you signing a contract oh i think so right is a lease to me that's a capital lease, we're going to treat it as debt. But if you don't have ownership, then it's an operating lease and we're not going to treat it as debt, we're going to treat it as an operating expense. That logic frayed at the edges a long time ago. You know when accountants realized they had a problem with leases? And doing it yourself is not a big deal. To convert leases from operating to financial expenses, here's what I need to do. I need to get your contractual commitments you've entered into. So I go through your contracts and this is how much. And you know what? US companies have been reporting that in the footnotes for the last 40 years. You take the present value of those commitments. That becomes your debt value. So I'm going to show it as debt on your balance sheet. time, right? Have you ever read this book? I used to love it. I love reading it to my kids. Give the mouse a cookie. I'll tell you the story because you look a little jaded. That's what happens. The mouse gets invited in and you give the mouse a cookie. And the mouse says, I want a glass of milk. Very demanding mouse. You give it a glass of milk, makes a mess. The mouse gets in the bath. The whole thing is just one thing on top of the other. This is very much like give the mouse a cookie. You thought you were done when you took the present value of least commitment. Guess what? It's got a ripple effect. It's going to create an asset, which is operating lease commit the most lease commitments one is retail restaurants airlines sometimes because depending on how they're classified most airlines used to be capital leases but some of them managed to get through shipping companies so you can see that leases are not equally a problem for everybody technology companies not a big deal right it's not like facebook or google the pre-tax cost of debt. So in terms of sequencing, do you see why I had to do the cost of capital first? Because that gave me the cost of equity and the cost of debt. That pre-tax cost of debt becomes a discount rate. You take the present value of the lease commitments. What you get is a present value is $4.4 billion. I'm going to put that on the balance sheet instead. If you thought retailers had very little debt prior told you, it's not a particularly pleasant thing to do, but at least it's the same thing over and over. Their operating income, just for leases, is closer to 1.36 billion. There's a shortcut you can use, which sometimes if you're in a hurry, you can go. But the shortcut basically takes the interest payment upfront that they went through various stages of delirium before coming back down to earth. So I said, okay, let me show you your actual numbers now and what the numbers look like with leases treated as that. So the first column is what the accounting looked like in 2007. Their operating income, according to the accountants, was 1.012 billion. I said, that's not really true because you're subtracting out lease expenses. I'm going to capitalize lease saying this is great, our earnings are higher, our cost of capital is lower. Well, it's a great place to be in. And then I said, there's one small catch. The way we measure the quality of a company is by looking at what kind of returns you make on your investment capital. With the old accounting, investment capital included only conventional debt. And the return on capital they were making was 12.9%. But if I treat leases as debt and bring it into my debt, my return on capital drops to 9.3%. Starbucks was just going crazy. Now, this is when you need Wi-Fi in New York. All you need to do was point your laptop, and there was a Starbucks. At that time, Wi-Fi was cheap in Starbucks. There was one every block, right? You missed a Starbucks. There's one block further down. They were competing with each other. They'd gone crazy. But on a conventional accounting basis, it looked like they were making 14% returns. pre-2019. So why again, remind me again, what is it about leases that makes me treat them as that contractual commitments, right? You're going to make them in good times and bad times. Any of you value Netflix? Nobody's valuing Netflix. Some of you will. I know by the end, you'll be like five people valuing Netflix because you wouldn't have picked a company. You'll be watching some Netflix shows. Oh my God, I've got to pick a company. You're going to end up picking Netflix. movies? They basically go to the original content provider, Disney in the case of Avengers, they enter into a five-year agreement to pay $100 million every year for the next five years. In return, they can show the Avengers show. Contractual commitment. If you look at the Netflix footnotes, take a look at it, they'll have lease commitments, which are already converted, but they also have content commitments. They still have, I think, $'m not taking you to Yankee Stadium and spending half the game looking for Dippin' Dots. I'll get you the Dippin' Dots at home. You just eat it here. You don't have to come to Yankee Stadium and look for Dippin' Dots. So I took my three sons. And we get tickets in the bleachers, right? It's an opening day. It's a day game. And the Yankees come running onto the field. The home team always is on the field first. And here's what I saw. was a guy called Alex Rodriguez. He was owed $27.5 million every year for the next 10 years. On the mound was a guy called CeCe Sabatia. I think $18 million a year every year for the next four years. And behind the plate was Jorge Posada, $15 million for three years. This is a very sick thing to do. But the game was done. Let's get them out there again.",
