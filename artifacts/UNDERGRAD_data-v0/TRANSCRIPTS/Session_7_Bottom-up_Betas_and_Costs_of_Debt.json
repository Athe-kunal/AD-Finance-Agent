So, I'm going to go ahead and start the presentation. So, I'm going to go ahead and start the presentation. So, I'm going to go ahead and start the presentation. I don't see a single hand go up. Everybody's in a group or you're too ashamed and don't admit it. Okay. Who's not picked a company yet. Come on, be honest. Really? This doesn't match up to your master list that I looked at this morning. I mean, if I believe that list, it's like what 60% of you have not picked company. So either the list isback on is betas. In fact, there are some parts, some audiences, all I have to say is beta, and I've lost them for the rest of the session. They've decided nothing else is worth listening to. So given that so many different people cap for every company. If you want to go that route and you want to use one discount rate, one cost of equity for every company, what should you be using? When we did the implied equity risk premium, you know what we do? We back out from the index and we say, right now, given how stocks are priced, if you want to use one cost of equity, at least have the good sense to adjust it over time because the number is going to move around. But I think it's the people, the true believers who come. This is the biggest stumbling block, which is I don't believe prices. So maybe that's the reason you don't like a price-based measure of risk. And I think that makes internal sense in terms of what you're trying to do. The third is you don't have a problem using prices, but you don't like the implicit assumption we make when we use beta is that only the risk you cannot diversify away matters, right? Because implicitly, that's what beta measures. It doesn't measure total risk. so i'll give you alternatives to betas you can use them you cannot use them so if you run into people say i don't like betas be willing to be flexible and say okay i'll use a different approach to risk because to me this is a small piece in a much bigger puzzle before the other thing i want to talk about very quickly to put regression betas to rest is sometimes people think when they're estimating betas they're doing statistics let me explain that a higher R squared is better than a lower R squared. And mathematically, that seems reasonable, right? But think of why the debate against Bovespa is more precise than one against the S&P 500. What is it about it? Yeah. It's a big part of the index, right? It's like Nokia, perhaps not as much dominant as Nokia is. But if your end game is incorrect. You're not going to get a beta that matters. It's going to be a beta that looks better in a statistical way. So I'm going to go back to the main packet and I think we're on page 83, maybe. Yeah, I think we're on page 83. And give you some options. These are options you might want to use, but have them as options in case you run into somebody who says, I don't like this beta thing. Do something different. And safer companies should have more stable earnings. Everybody agree with that? And I've tried it. In fact, it's not difficult to do. I compute the standard deviation earnings for every company that's publicly traded. And I don't trust standard deviations in earnings for a very simple reason. What are accountants trained to do when you get distortions? Smooth them out, right? So you have an expense, you spread it out over time. I understand why they're doing it. But the nature of accounting They get smoothed out. And sometimes they do strange things. Unexpected charges, extraordinary charges. So it's not a panacea, but if that makes you feel better, I'll go along with earnings. with this approach is you're effectively going to, it's going to work maybe for infrastructure companies with a lot of debt, but with most other companies, a cost of debt-based estimate of the cost of equity doesn't make much sense. I'm not trying to talk you out of it, but I'm saying there's no alternative here. That's perfect. Every alternative you pick is going to come with cost. You got to decide what your poison is. So when you think about price-based measures, assumption. So when you don't want to assume that investors are diversified, then again, I'm going to ask you, okay, investors, if you don't want to make that assumption, are you okay with price-based measures? If you say yes, then I have a simple solution to the beta problem. Beta, look at only the portion of your variance that is due to the market. That's what a covariance and that regression does, kind of hidden in the risk. You can look at what I call proxy models. In proxy models, you tell me what type of company you have. Small company, lots of physical assets. I'll give you a cost of equity based on your character. That's what a proxy model does. In fact, one way a proxy model works is you tell me what sector you're in, technology, I'll give judgments that back up your preconceptions. So I'm going to stay with the CAPM with all of its weaknesses and limits. But if you don't like it, again, remember, there are alternatives. This is not an approach that rests on you accepting the CAPM as the only way of measuring cost of equity. And if you want to go the accounting route, you trust accountants, not particularly creative, but essentially their argument is we put the safest stocks in one, the riskiest stocks in five. And they had some kind of weighted judgment they made based on earnings and cash flows. If that's what works for you, classify companies into five groups and put them based on, give them cost of equity based on risky or safe. I'm okay with that as well. As long as you risk adjust the discount rate, you're 80 come from you know people who use betas I had one banker try to tell me where babies came from I said no no betas I know where babies come from I have four of them and you know what the reactions you ask a banker where do betas come from they look at you like you have two heads what do you mean where do betas come from they come from Bloomberg they come from Barra because let's face it once you start working betas come from services nobody sits there and runs a regression non-cyclical business. Historically cyclical business, you had housing and steel and automobiles and non-cyclical, you had food and household products. And until about 30 years ago, this is the only line I used to draw. Cyclical on this side, non-cyclical. But the world is getting messier. So I'll give you another distinction that I think works better. The more discretionary There are not that many left, but there's still a few. Then you've got discount retailers. Let's say grocery retailers are also in the mix. Which of these four groups should have the highest beta? Yes. You can live without those Gucci's, trust me. I know you feel you will die if you don't get them, but who are you, Kim Kardashian? You got Safeway and Kroger and you got Whole Foods and Sprouts. So if I were looking across these companies, which grocery store should have the highest beta and which one should have the lower beta? Why do you go to Whole Foods? Because you feel rich. You say, I have a lot of money. I'm willing to pay three times what I should be paying for eggplant because I get organic eggplant. but those are the issues we haven't tested yet. I mean, many of these big tech companies have never really been tested, right? We haven't had a severe recession in a long time. We're going to find out if there's a recession, how discretionary your DoorDash is and your Netflix is. So we're going to get a testing mechanism, but think discretionary, non-discretionary. Yep. Yeah, what about, How many billionaires do you know? None. Get out of here. Right. But if you look at a Daimler or a BMW, they tended to have more volatile sales than a Volkswagen. So within the automobile sector, you have variations. And I would say the same thing about electric cars. Right. This is one of the big challenges that Tesla faces. It might dominate the electric car space now, but it's still what does a Tesla 3 cost? if you're appealing to a much broader group and making your products and service less discretion yes pandemic we all lost our minds i would take 2020 out of every single analysis we do because we were doing weird stuff you know because it might be that we were so attached to our phones in that stop. Tell me something about your product or service. So I want you to think about whatever product or service your company produces. Is it discretionary? Is it not? Yes. Then low risk. So you've answered my question, right? Which is, can you live without your legal drugs? I use the word legal in front. Okay. That's a good question. in bad times. That could change. Maybe if Medicare becomes the leading payer for medicine, that could affect, you know, what would happen. But right now, at least in the U.S., not a particularly discretionary product. In fact, this discretionary, non-discretionary econ classes, you had a different name for it, right? What does that measure? Elasticity of demand, right? Every class you ever take in the school is in service of my class. Only reason that econ class even matters What do fixed costs do? In good time? Go ahead. Exactly, right? If you have mood swings, think of having a lot of fixed costs as making you bipolar, basically, because your moods are going to swing. I mean, in good times, you're going to make tons of money. In bad times, you're going to lose tons of money. Businesses with a lot of fixed costs will have more volatile earnings, more variable earnings. And I'll give you my favorite example we go. There won't be eight people left on the plane after you do that. I know there's some variation depending on load, but you're going to burn through the fuel whether there are eight people on the plane. So fuel costs, mostly fixed costs. Employee expenses. You're unionized. I've been on flights where I've been outnumbered by the stewardesses. Doesn't improve the service any, but you're outnumbered. There are five of them. Remember, I used to fly after 9-11. There'd be three people on the plane, five stewardesses. Well, so it's a function of the oil price, right? So there your cost structure stays the same. So oil companies last year had an astoundingly good year in terms of earnings. Oil companies in 2020 had an astoundingly bad year. Now think of what Southwest does that's different from a typical airline. First, it leases its aircraft, but for the longest time, every single Southwest aircraft was a Boeing 737. You know why they did that? Because it meant that they could keep one maintenance crew on every, and didn't have to, because every aircraft is unique enough that you got to bring in different maintenance crews. that kept their costs low. I remember the first time I flew Southwest out of the New York area. And I'm using that word deliberately. So I make this reservation to fly from Southwest from New York to LA. Got a cheap flight. Very happy day of the flight comes about. And I'm glad I checked in time because I'm checking which airport am I flying out of? Oh, it's not New York. It's not JFK. It's not LaGuardia. It's at Islip. If you're from Islip, I mean, have you ever been to Terminal C in New York? It's a United terminal. It used to be the Continental terminal. It's like 200 gates. And they do things like fly you into gate seven and give you a connecting flight in gate 153. I think they do it just for laughs. I think there's some guy upstairs with a camera on. He said, look, she's never going to make it. Let's switch the sides on her. It's like 100 gates in there. Maybe three days from now, you'll get there. But the higher your fixed cost, the higher your bid. And Southwest deliberately created a model to keep fixed costs down. You know how this manifested itself? The month after 9-11, Southwest had a higher market cap than all of the other airlines put together. It's the only airline that showed any chance of surviving that is low so what's driving the variance it are fewer and fewer of them left around the world which brings me a third and final question so what business are you in what fixed cost do you have how much have you borrowed you see why this question is relevant if you own equity in a company when you borrow money you create a fixed cost you did not have until you borrowed the money what am I talking about and maybe how much it's more. So let's start with the first step. We're going to start with the bane of the business. If you're in the steel business, you didn't invent this business. It's been a business that's been around. There are other companies in the business. I'm going to look at risk at other companies in the business to get a sense of how risky is this business. Now, if you happen to be a business like any other steel business, I'll assume your fixed cost and variable cost look very much like any other. But if you're like a Southwest, you for leverage that we know how to use. So if you tell me what the fixed and variable costs are of every company in a sector, I can tell you how much lower Southwest beta has to be than other airlines. But what did I say you have to know? How much fixed and variable costs are in every company. So, if you're starting out with like industry beta, is the industry beta calculated through a bunch of different regressions? You're actually good. So, in fact, I'm going to get to that point of how is this a solution to the regression beta problem? Because to get an industry beta, what did I do? I took 100 regressions and I averageded beta. What does that mean? The beta reflects not just the business you're in, but how much debt you took on. So if you can tell me how much debt you have as a company. I can tell you how much higher your beta should be given that debt. So the equation that gets used, it's called the Hamada equation. It's been around 50 years. It's to basically start with the beta of the business you're in. So the unlevered beta is the beta of the business you're in. And then bring in the effective debt through your debt to equity ratio. assumption until you get to really risky companies. You know why, right? If you lend to a really risky company, your debt is going to start to behave like equity. Your claim, instead of being a contractual claim, will start to look like a residual claim. You'll get whatever's left over because you don't want to push them into bankruptcy. So there will be cases where people say, well, you're making a strong assumption here. You're assuming the beta of debt is zero. And my response is, way I've estimated beta is the 30 years. I've never, I haven't used regression beta to value a company in a really, really long time. I compute what's called a bottom-up beta. And to illustrate the process, I'm going to let you be my guinea pig. So you started a business, you started a company, it's in two businesses. Pick any two. What two businesses would you like to be in? So you want to be in healthcare? You want to run hospitals? beta on each of them. I take the average regression beta for the 100 healthcare companies and the average regression beta for the 100 hotel companies. I have an average beta for each business. Remember that beta I said reflects the business they're in as well as the debt they've taken on. So I'm going to look at the debt to equity ratio for healthcare companies and the debt to equity ratio for hotel companies. I'm still staying with a comparable list. And I'm going to take out the effect of debt. debt, in which case I'm done, right? But if you tell me you have debt, I compute your debt to equity ratio and lever your beta up to reflect your leverage. It's called a bottom-up beta. And now let me get back to the question. How is this saving me from the regression beta curse? Instead of one regression beta, all I've done is used an average of 100, right? What is one the other problem I had with regression betas? It reflected your company as it used to be. You told me you're in two businesses. Let me fill in the details. Let's suppose you entered, right? It's not even a choice. It's not listed. I can now estimate the beta for a company that's not listed because I don't need past prices. I just need to know what business you're in, how much debt you have. A bottom-up beta is not a panacea, but it removes many of the issues you have. You still have to deal with the diversified investor part if you don't like that. can you pick a sample that gives you if you but remember what i said up front if you have strong enough bias you're going to find a way through any system but here's what i would suggest you do if you know people do that near the other side of the table and they show you a list of 27 companies as the companies that used to get the beta you know what the question you need to ask them is right did you start with 27 they will lie and, but you don't have to let them play games. You can compute the average yourself. You have capital IQ. Have you started your access to capital IQ yet? No, right? Do it now. So let me give you a few examples of bottom-up beta calculations. The first is a beta calculation I did. And I do use this company in my corporate finance class, a company called Vale. It's a mining company. It's Brazil-based. It's the largest iron ore mining company in the world. But it also is in a bunch of other businesses, other metals, fertilizers, logistics. So I valued Vale a few years ago, and I wanted to get a beta for the company. I took its businesses. started with C and D, I'm not willing to listen because that seems awfully arbitrary. There are the unleveled betas for those businesses. So that's what I report on my website. So this is the time saver. Once you've estimated them at the start of the year, I'm not redoing it every time I do evaluation. And the beta for Vale is a weighted average of the betas of the different businesses there. That's a question I asked him, weights. And based on my looking at Vale, this looks like a company about 77% iron ore mining, 16% metals, and 5% fertilizers and 1.76% logistics. The only rule you cannot violate is you better make sure your weights add up to be the outlier, the 2.2. This is not a game I want to play. The larger your sample, the less you care about outliers. So go for bigger samples. That's the advantage. Because with small samples, outliers can be a factor. And there's a simple fix for outliers, right? Instead of using the average, what should you use instead? Just use the median. It's a much simpler fix. You won't have to worry about outliers. But essentially what you're in multiple businesses, this is a way in which you can get a beta for the company. And it's good work because it'll make you understand what does my company do? Where does its value come from? Now, there are a couple of mechanical questions I want to kind of address here in terms of doing this because this is something I've described a long time. People do it. with one company called Embraer. And then I asked, why am I staying geographically frozen? Embraer makes aircraft that it sells in Europe, it sells in the US. It competes not against other Latin American, it competes against Bombardier, it competes against, you know, even the smaller jets that Boeing produces. I said, it's a global aerospace company. Increasingly, when I value companies, I go to my global averages. I get two benefits. with that screen to see how it changes as you put in additional screens, take screens away. So to the question of can I use the unlevered beta for US and European companies to look at Embraer, I don't see why not. And here's why. What's the average beta across all US companies? It's about one. It's about one because it and within each one, you get the weights of every student. You can't compare the weights across the rooms if some rooms are filled with obese students and others are with undernourished students, right? But what if I took the weight of every student and divided by the average weight of the students in the room? That's what a beta does. It gives you a relative measure of risk. a smaller number than gross debt to compute things like debt ratios. Sounds like it should be consequential, right? If you take Embraer, for instance, their gross debt ratio is 19%. Take total debt. And if I use that gross debt ratio, the beta that I get for Embraer, starting with the aerospace company beta is 1.07. The net debt ratio for Embraer is minus 3.32%. will be lower than your cost of equity gross debt ratios. But remind me again what the rest of the process requires. I have to take that cost of equity, put it into a cost of capital calculation, right? So your cost of equity gets multiplied by the weight of equity. Your cost of debt gets weighted by the amount of debt you have. You use gross debt ratios for Embraer. You're going to have a higher cost of equity, but then you do your cost of capital, you're going to get this weighting down effect because 15% of your company comes from debt consistently. Don't go back and forth. I prefer gross debt ratios when I do 11 betas and keep cash as a separate asset. But if you prefer to net them out, as I said, many European and Latin American analysts do, I'm okay with that as long as you do that all through the analysis. So let's summarize where we are. If I asked you for a cost of equity, three ingredients, right? What risk-free rate should you use? Let me out in country risk into your beta and your risk-free rate. That's why I took out the default spread from the government bond. It's to prevent the double counting. So risk-free rate, beta is equity risk premiums. Lots of moving pieces there. But go back and review the last 60, 70 pages of notes because they were leading up to this page of here's how we come up with the risk-free rates. cost of equity, right? So what you pay, what you're costing out the equity portion. Let's complete the other half of the picture. There's another way you can raise capital, which is you can go and borrow money. So I want to deal with the question, what's your cost of debt? And I'm going to lay out the principle that's going to govern how I think about the cost of debt. The cost of debt for a company is the rate at which it can borrow money long term to debt. to debt based on the maturity of what you borrow, you know what they're going to do, right? They're going to take all their debt, make it short term and tell you the debt got cheaper. So I'm going to avoid that. I'm going to say, look, tell me how much debt you have. I'm going to attach a long term cost. What's it today bringing to the process? I mean, if you look at a company's existing debt, some of it was borrowed in 2022, some in 2021. And if you look at the interest rate on that debt, what are you going to see? Lower numbers than you have today company that has bonds outstanding, that trade, it looks like you have an easy, it's like a slam dunk. You're saying, I know what the cost of debt is. All I have to do is look at the yield to matured in the bond. That should be a rate at which you can borrow money today. And that's technically true. But here's why you should be cautious. Can a risky company issuing a double A-rated bond and a triple B-rated bond at the same time because it depends on what's backing up those bonds. So if you decide to go with a bond, be careful that it's not a bond that's an outlier, that it doesn't. But I'll give you an easier way. If you have bonds outstanding, you also have something else observable outstanding you can use to estimate your cost of debt, which is a rating. when I ask you how risky is a company from a debt perspective, you have two choices. You can do all the dirty work yourself of computing all the default risk measures and the ratios, or you can trust Moody's. Be honest with me. Which of those two pathways looks more attractive to you at the moment? I'll be honest. Every single time I get to the stage, the last thing I want to be doing is being a fixed income guy, projecting, you know, bond ratings. It used to be at one point in time that US companies had bond ratings, but outside the US, companies did not. Because even in Europe, companies used to borrow from banks. So as recently as 25 years ago. Now, of course, bond markets have developed in Europe, they've developed in Asia. You have ratings for about 30%, maybe 35% of global companies. ratios, EBITDA to fixed charges, EBITDA to interest expenses, debt to capital. And so we use these eight ratios. And one thing I've learned by looking at these services is they like to throw a lot of noise into their measurement mechanisms. So I said, okay, maybe use these eight ratios, but I'm going to try to reverse engineer what you really look at to come up with your ratings. I downloaded the ratings for every rated company and the eight ratios they divide by interest expense. So the higher this ratio, the safer you feel as a lender, right? You got more buffer. So this ratio is seven. You've got $7 of income for every dollar in interest expenses. You feel much safer than if this ratio is three. Now, for Embraer, in 2004, that ratio was 3.56. I'd use an average across time because the income was all over the place. You know what a lookup table is? You tell me what the interest coverage ratio is based on how ratings agencies attach ratings. I'll tell you what a rating will look like for your company. My interest coverage ratio table in 2004 and the 2023 version is on my website. So the 65% of companies that don't, if your company has a rating, don't go looking for trouble. You don't need a synthetic rating. Trust Moody's to have looked at more than just the interest coverage rate. But if you don't, this is a quick and dirty way of coming up with a rating and a cost of debt. In the case of Embraer, for instance, with the 3.56 interest coverage ratio, the rating I gave them was A-. It's a purely synthetic rating based on, so debt as well. That's why I said life's not fair. You're a Greek company. You walk in. You tell the bank I'm a Greek company. The bank says 30% interest rates. I haven't shown you my financials. I'm really strong. 29% maybe. In fact, for the longest time, ratings agencies in the US used to have a sovereign ceiling on your rating that no company in a portion of the country default spread. Why only a portion? Because Embraer gets 70% of its revenues outside or 97% outside Brazil. I would expect to be less exposed to default risk than a company that gets all of its revenues in Brazil. It's like a Lambda playing out here. But when you do cost of debt for emerging market companies, there could be two default spreads, one for the company and one for the country. So that's the cost of debt.",
