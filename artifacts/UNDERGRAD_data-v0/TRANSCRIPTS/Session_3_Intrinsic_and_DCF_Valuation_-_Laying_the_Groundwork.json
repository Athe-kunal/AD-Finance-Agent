{"text": " you oh Yeah. Sorry to do that. I'm going to stay close to this podium then because this mic is obviously working. So today's session, I hate being behind the podium, but I have no choice. Today is my long day. Are the two mics working? I think both mics are working. This is a soft. Now, you know, you can buy it. You can use it for the dinner. But if you decide to pay, you want to buy a two bedroom apartment, two million dollars, maybe a million, that's a cheaper apartment, a million dollars, covered, 15 miles away from the subway stop, and a million dollars. And unless, now it's okay. Let's say tomorrow the apartment drops in value from $1 million to $900,000. You still owe the $800,000. You can't go to the bank and say, guys, the house went down in price. Could you lower the loan as well? It doesn't work that way. Your equity went from $200,000 to $100,000. The value of the apartment drops to $800,000. Now you're looking at equity worth nothing. And if the house keeps dropping, the way you do valuation is you look at the cash flows you get as an equity investor, which are cash flows left over after interest payments, debt payments. That's your cash flow to equity. And you discount them back at a rate of return you need to make as an equity investor based on the risk of the investor. It's called the cost of equity. Cash flows to equity, discounted the cost of equity, gives you a value of equity. the cash flows are. Lenders get contractually committed cash flows. You get residual cash flows. But what if I added those two cash flows together? Think of what equity investors and lenders get. It's kind of counterintuitive because nobody thinks about lenders as partners, but they're providing capital as well. That collective cash flow is called the cash flow to the firm. It's a pre-debt cash flow because every claim order gets paid business. So that's one of the first rules in valuation is don't mix and match. You know what I mean by mixing and matching? Don't take cash flows to equity and discount them at the cost of capital. Don't take cash flows to the firm and discount them at the cost of equity. Sounds like an obvious first principle, but it's amazing how often you called Peabody Co. The antitrust laws were imposed and Kennecott was forced to divest itself of its coal mining subsidiary. They received $600 million on the sale. Kennecott was a $3 billion company at the time of the sale. So when you sell something and you receive $600 million cash, you now have a lot of cash in your balance sheet. And that terrified Kennecott's000 in cash and saying, can you help me spend it? A lot of people that might work on commission, maybe it's not in Bloomingdale's, but they're going to find something for you to buy, right? So Canaccord went to First Boston at the time, one of the leading investment banks on Wall Street, the leading M&A bank. And they said, we have $600 million. We need to spend it quickly. Can you find us a target? And First Boston said, can to ask you a question about how they computed cash flows and what discount rate is best right. So I'll tell you how the cash flows are computed. And as I go through it, I want you to get a sense of what kind of cash flow I'm estimating. They start with the revenues. They worked all the way down to operating income. Then they subtracted out interest expenses. They came up with net income. Then they added depreciation, subtracted cap X. with the money or cost of capital, or I can use carburetum, the target company's cost of equity capital, or I can come up with a merge company's cost of equity capital. So let's start with the easy one first. Given how I computed cash flows, should I discount at a cost of equity or a cost of capital? Yes. And tell me what is it about what I did that led you to that answer? money, they should reflect the riskiness of what you're discounting. This is not a maybe, should be. When you're doing acquisition valuation, the acquiring company's cost of equity and capital should never come into the picture. It should always be the target company's characteristics that should come in. What about the merge company? You can't merge a risky company. This is like a 300-pounder marrying an 80- at 16 and a half percent, you come up with the present value. You take those same cash flows, you discount them at 10 and a half percent, you're going to come up with a much higher value. The reason they found this deal to be a good deal was not because this was a good company to buy, but because they used the wrong discount rate. cash flows, the other is the discount rates. What have we been taught? Discounted cash flow valuation is cash flows is discount rates. Let's bring them together. This happens over and over again because people don't even ask the question, what are these cash flows I'm discounting? We're going to extend this principle to currencies. If your cash flows are in Indonesian rupiah, your discount rate has20 bill in a brown paper bag. This is how they got rewarded for years of malpractice and acquisitions. They got to start their own firm that did M&A. Deals. and then we're going to focus in on the first steps in valuation so let me find the presentation let me go back to the valuation intro section we were talking about intrinsic valuation right remind me again for intrinsic valuation what you're doing you're valuing the company the price is different than you say getting done is please god let the price adjust to that in cash flows, right? You can't do intrinsic valuation if you're valuing Bitcoin or if you're trying to invest in, no, I don't know, gold. But you can do intrinsic valuation if you're valuing a business, valuing a stock, valuing a bond. That's the first ingredient. You need something with cash flows. But let's look at the ingredients you have to bring to the game for intrinsic valuation to work for you. First, you need to understand the basics of valuation, be able to value companies. You also need a long time horizon. They're on CNBC. And what do they say? Look, this company is massively undervalued. And they might believe it, but you can see the advantage there of being somebody with a megaphone is now other people hear you and they say, well, Carl, I can. Carl thinks the stock is undervalued. I'm going to go and buy the stock. It's an advantage that activist investors, that's what we call these people have over passive investors, is CEO might keep going to 115, but you know, you need a catalyst. So as we go through this class, I'm not going to argue that valuation, intrinsic valuation should be the tool you pick because you might have a time horizon of 16 minutes or three months. Even if you can do intrinsic valuation right, you shouldn't be trying it in your portfolio. You don't be sexist here could be the it could be as pretty as anybody on the line right so basically in in kane said he said look if you're a judge in a beauty contest your job is not assess who the best looking person on the stage is look at the other judges to see who they think so when you're judging a beauty contest you're not even looking at the stage you're looking at the other judges you see how pricing works the same company. And they trade at different prices, even after you adjust for exchange rates. You have what's called arbitrage. You have two companies, different prices. It's a pricing game. Well, if you can't find an identical company, you might try to find companies that you claim are similar to your company. The reason I use claim is it's a judgment call. Well, you know, I'm going to look for companies, the same geography, the same market cap, but you adjust for those differences. In a nutshell, that's what pricing is. You take every equity research report, a well-done one will basically go through those steps. In pricing, are you assuming markets make mistakes? Yes. But the mistake markets are making is they get the sector right. You're making the assumption that on average, companies are correctly priced in the sector. They're getting, look, my job is not gauge the market. It's to find cheap or expensive stocks. And if your job is to find undervalued stocks or underpriced stocks, you're going to find them. With pricing, half of all stocks, roughly speaking, will always look cheap. And that's a good thing for you if you have to be invested in equities. pricing. In terms of disadvantages, because of the way you do pricing, if an entire sector is overpriced, social media companies, AI companies, cloud companies, because you're doing pricing, something's always going to look cheap. You're going to find something that looks cheap relative to other companies, but they're all overpriced. Guess what's going to happen? There's going to be a correction across the sector are paying, you know, you're paying 200, 250 times earnings. So you pay 200 times earnings. Are you assuming something about growth and earnings when you pay 200 times earnings? Implicitly, you're assuming that there's going to be high growth in the future, right? The promise is implicit. You never make it explicit. Every time you stocks, but if you're in the Portuguese market with only 100 companies in the entire market, you might very quickly run into a rock because your company might be the only one in there. We'll talk about ways of getting around. It gets even worse if you're pricing something that's truly unique. You see why pricing a Picasso is going to be much more difficult than pricing a software company. Why? Because to price a Picasso, you have to not the way it works, right? Because it depends on the quality of the painting. Now, do you see why appraisers for paintings get 6% of the appraisal fee? Because you're now pricing things and it's not easy because you don't have lots of comparable assets, lots of transactions. But from an individual perspective, again, let's think about what you need to bring to the table for pricing to work for you. First, you need to have relatively and hope and pray they get correct. At their core, what sets hedge funds apart from mutual funds? What can hedge funds do? Yeah. They can sell short, which means they can decide that if something is overpriced, so now do you see why if you're good at pricing and you can play both sides, you're going to buy the underpriced, you're going to sell the overpriced. You really don't care whether the market's right or not, Picassos. So I'm going to draw a line between what can be valued and what cannot be valued. If you have assets, and my definition of assets is they generate cash flows. It could be a business, it could be a stock, it could be a bond. You could both value it and price it. We do the stocks all the time. If you have a commodity, you could value it at a macro level. So if I asked you what the fair value for oil is, why do we have currency in our pockets? What do we carry? We want to pay for things. So first thing we need in a good currency is a medium of exchange, right? Second, if you leave it in your pocket and you forget about it for a year, pull those pants from last year, you put them on, you want to make sure that the currency is stuck in your back pocket And I was actually able to buy more with the hundreds with francs than I was three years before because there was deflation in the period. Great currency because good medium of exchange creates store of value. What about the Venezuelan boulevard? I don't even think they take the boulevard in Venezuela, right? They say, give me lettuce instead. It's great at staying power. Terrible medium of exchange. It's a terrible currency. It's an inefficient currency. I mean, who creates a currency where every time you spend the currency, a thousand Ukrainian miners have to guess a nine-digit number? Currencies can be priced. And if you want to ask, is Bitcoin worth $20,000 or $22,000 or $23,000? The question you have to address is, is Bitcoin a good currency? I don't think it is, it's malleable. So you can make it into coins. So whatever reason it got that collectible. But it's a collectible. Collectibles cannot be valued. They can be priced. So let's think about why it is that of holding its worth. The Barry Bonds rookie card, maybe not so much. But the argument that some people make for Bitcoin is it's millennial gold. You know what I mean by millennial gold? If you're 35 years old, you don't want to buy gold because that's what your parents did. And that's old fashioned. So you buy Bitcoin instead. And that's been an argument for Bitcoin. dog poop is scarce. There's only a certain amount of the face of the earth. I don't go around and say this is good currency. There's only a certain amount of dog poop in the world. I don't try that because you'd laugh me out of the room. So when somebody says only 21 million Bitcoin in the world, it's going to go up in price. That's an incredibly weak argument to make. So with that long lead in, let's talk about worth. It could be because you want to buy the company because you think it's worth less than the sum of its parts. In each of those cases, you've got to put a number, not in the company, but on the individual assets. But here's why I don't think it's a different way of valuing companies. To put a number on an asset, I have to do one of two things. I have to either do an intrinsic valuation of that asset or a pricing of the asset. After you've done intrinsic valuation and after you've done pricing, I'm going to see if your views have changed. So right now you might say, I'm a true believer in intrinsic valuation. I'm a rational person. This makes more sense. But after you've negotiated your way through an intrinsic valuation, you might change your mind. So leave open that possibility. So make a choice now. And the same slide will show up in the very last class. And let's see if your choices change. Which brings me to the third and final way you can put a number on a company. options. I'm not going to look at the traditional uses of options, but the best way to think about what makes an option an option is to draw a payoff diagram. You draw the payoff diagram for something and it looks like this. I don't care what you call it, there is an option embedded there. You know what's unique about option payoff diagrams? If you have a call option, you get the right to buy at a fixed price. You can never lose more than what you paid for the call option. goes up. Why is that? Go ahead. Well, you could say that about every risky asset, right? So it's not the baked into the price that sets it apart. Yes. In fact, let me reframe the question. How many of you stayed awake at night worrying about upside risk? And if you say, oh my God, my stock might go up 80%. That terrifies me. about what makes you deeply troubled. You're money losing, you have a lot of debt. You're money losing and a lot of debt, what's hanging over your head? Bankruptcy or distress. The equity now starts to behave like an option. You know why? What's your worst case scenario? Lose all your money. You say, that's bad enough. What's your best case scenario? The company comes back. You buy equity in a deeply troubled airline. You're not buying it companies the traditional way. So I'm going to apply option pricing to value equity in a deeply troubled company. You buy shares in an oil company. The oil company has reserves, option away, but if oil prices come back, your oil company could come back. I'm going to value undeveloped reserves at natural resource companies as options. You buy shares in a young pharmaceutical company, no revenues, no earnings, lots of expenses, but it's got a promising product working its way through a pipeline. You're buying an option. It's not something you're going to use in every company, but there are some companies based on the option pricing for the company. There's no right or wrong. Each one comes with advantages and disadvantages. Which one you decide to pick will depend both on what you've been asked to put a number on and your personal characteristics as an individual. Do you have a long-time horizon or a short-time horizon? but sorry about this it's a big packet as you can see it will tell me probably that first left oh there you go thank you okay so let's get started this is the packet that's going to take you through almost two-thirds of the class okay so let's start by restating what i just said about intrinsic valuation intrinsic valuation the value of an asset is the present cash flow evaluation. Here's what you do. You have expected cash flows in the numerator. Expected cash flows that reflect all the different things that can happen to your company. That's my expectation. And then you risk adjust the discount rate. More risky cash flow. That's a typical discounted cash flow evaluation. But there's a second way in which you could do discounted cash flow evaluation that's almost never done right. I mean, it's. See, ready? There's two suitcases, one with a million, one with a zero. What's the expected value? It's 500,000, right? Most of you, though, will accept less than 500,000 to walk away. Why is that? Well, risk averse. Human beings are risk averse. If you're risk neutral, you would never need to adjust this contract. $15, $30. Now do you see why people don't do this approach to discounted cash flow valuation? Because you have to go in and adjust the cash flows and make them, in a sense, guaranteed cash flows. And once you do that, guess what uses your discount rate? Use the risk-free rate because your cash flows are guaranteed. You'll never see this done. But there are some investors who use a variant without ever calling it this. when he forecasts earnings and cash flows. He just forecasts that portion of earnings and cash flows that he says he can count on. He doesn't use the word certainty equivalent, but essentially he's not counting all of the earnings and cash flows. He's counting a subset. He's doing in his mind a risk adjustment on the cash flows. Here's what you cannot do. If you do that on your, some of you in your turn in evaluations will tell me that you've done a conservative estimate of your cash flows. up so i'm not a magician i've got a twenty dollar bill i'm going to put in the envelope ready how much would you pay for this envelope don't take too long that's the answer i usually get let me follow up if you pay twenty dollars for an envelope of twenty dollars what do you walk away with from this transaction you walk away with this battered envelope which i stole from the ninth floor so first rule in intrinsic valuation if you know does it say control i'm going to put control into the envelope remember it was a twenty dollars i've now added control to the mix how much should you pay for this envelope now how much more give me give me a number okay can you give me twenty one dollars in which case what have you paid for a dollar for a three by five card you know how much it mean it. I said, now you feel the pain because it's your own money. But when it's your client's money, you don't seem to care that much. Let's keep playing. What does it say? Synergy. That's a big one. Let's put that in there. Again, it's a three by five card with the word synergy. But it'll be amazing. I mean, how much people pay for synergy as a buzzword since we're on this? What does it say? ESG. sell something for way more than it's worth, we'll get you a premium. What does it say? Strategic. If you ever hear that word in the context of an acquisition and you're the one paying, run for the exit door right now. Because you know what strategic means, right? The numbers don't fly, but I really, really want to do this. Strategic deal billion people somehow turns people's brains to mush? They start adding zeros. Until a few years ago, that word alone would add a 20% premium, 30% premium to your value. Today, though, it could work against you. can you do? Anybody want to give that a shot? What is control? Yes. Could it be like some kind of option? Like now you can decide to do something with the company. You can change the way the company is run, right? So if you control Disney, you might say, I'm going to shut down Disney Plus. I mean, this might be good or bad, but basically you say, it's my company. I'm going to change the way the company is run. To value control, you know what I need to do? I need to value the company twice. Once with the existing management in place and to the aspirin section and i guarantee you you will see bare aspirin and right next to it you'll see a generic aspirin check the prices out if you don't believe me you're going to pay about twice as much for the bare aspirin check the ingredients you know what you're going to see it's exactly the response is show me where. And after digging for three years, I can't find a single place to put it, which means we've been sold a concept with no basis in value now for a are always about the price you pay. So unless you can figure out a way in which you can take that world run and do something different with that world run, that's the essence of synergy. You better tell me specifically what you can do differently that the existing management cannot. You're on very dangerous ground acquiring companies for more than they want. You know that 80% of acquisitions are value-destructed. And you leave. You know how difficult that is to do once you start getting involved in a deal? Because somewhere along the way, how do we define a good deal? A good deal is a deal that gets done. That's not a definition of a good deal. A good deal is a deal that gets done at the right price. But you let bankers decide. They will never let you leave the room, right? Because as a banker, how do you get paid? By having the deal done. For God's sakes, lock the bankers out of the room. cash flows when I look at my cash flows last year. You're giving up way too soon, right? Because the fact, when I said, you know, when you look at what drives the value of companies, not just cash flows next year, it's cash flows over time. I'm going to, you know, as a companion, give you what I call the Der proposition, which is you have a company, you estimate cash flows, not just next year, but every year, think about cash flows and growth and risk. So let's go back to where we started the class. There are two choices, equity valuation or firm valuation. How do you get from the value of the business to value of equity? What do you have to do? In other words, you value a house and I asked you to come up with the equity value. What did you do? You subtracted the debt outstandingly. So this is something I want you to think about. I'm not going to give you the answer right now, but as we get further into the class, we're going to come back to what debt should I be subtracting? I value the entire business. Should I subtract only long-term debt? Should I subtract total debt? Should I treat leases as debt, which accountants are doing now, but no. Should I subtract all liabilities? So we're ready to state the principle that drives valuation. Cash flows to equity, you discounted the cost of equity. Cash flows to firm, you discounted the cost of capital. I'm going to give you an example. And I'll confess, I've kind of cooked the numbers in this example to work in my favor. So in this company, I've given you cash flows to equity, after debt cash flows, and cash flows to firm, pre-debt cash flows. The cost of equity for this's see if it works out. So first I took the cash flows to equity, discounted them back at the cost of equity. I got a value of equity of 1,073 million. Then I took the cash flows of a pre-debt cash flows, but to discount them, I need a cost of capital. So I had an intermediate stock to make. I had to take a weighted average of my cost of equity and cost of debt. And I use the market values of debt and equity to come up with the weights. The weighted average cost of capital is 9.94%. equity, a cash flow is that I'm doing what first Boston did in the example. But that's the consistency test I want you to think about. Just because you have cash flows and you have a discount rate, you can't bring them together and have a discount cash flow valuation until you've stopped and made sure that you've got consistency. In fact, if I mix and match it, and I'll show you what the numbers look like, if I discounted, for instance, the cash flows to equity at the cost of capital, example and then you valued indirectly by valuing the business and subtracting our debt you're going to get different values for the equity which is going to leave you uncomfortable but then i'm going to ask you what it is about what you've assumed that's giving you different values there's something i've implicitly assumed in this valuation that allow things to work and i want you to think as you do that weekly challenge what is that thing what is that", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 2.0], "text": " you"}, {"timestamp": [16.8, 217.42], "text": " oh Yeah.
