{"text": " um Friday. So, I'm more worried about still going to the house. Probably no. Probably just going to fire me. Yeah, well, I'm kissing quite a bit. I'm not going to do that. You can do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to change your company now because there's really no point. How many people value banks in general? How many of us value banks? No? Nobody? because the customer can come in. That's basically it, right? I mean, what they invested in was we consider it pretty safe. The mortgage-backed securities they bought were highly rated, they bought a lot of treasury bonds. The problem was they bought 10, 20-year securities with deposits that were either demand deposits or short-term fixed rate deposits. They didn't duration mismatch. In my corporate finance class, I talk about this as one of those close to 0%, right? They did it for a simple reason, which is they said these deposits are effectively free. We're paying almost nothing on it. We can invest in 1.7%. We're going to keep the spread. This is how violations get born. It looks easy. And then the whole thing blew up, of course, in 2022, because long-term rates went to 4%. And what I mean, we talked about the estimating the market value of a bond. It's it goes back to first principles. If you violate first principles, things will always catch up. I mean, there's actually a variant of this called the carry trade. Now, a lot of hedge funds claim to use. What's a carry trade? Somebody described to me how you make money in a carry trade. What do you do? it's catastrophic i call these strategies the dispute strategy win most of the time but when you lose you lose in catastrophic amounts so keep that in mind as you look at people say it's easy money to be made there is no easy money to be made anywhere in markets take that as a given so when somebody says it's easy money to be made they either haven't looked hard enough or they don't know when to know there's always a catch capital. Good thing to do, right? But they mangled the whole offering because one of the offerings leaked out before the actual offering was started. by Wednesday or Thursday, First Republic is probably going to be acquired by somebody because once that debt spiral starts, what can you do to stop it, right? You can't talk it off. You can't talk investors off the ledge, depositors off the ledge. The question is, will it stop at First Republic or will it find the next target? You can already see that each new target is essentially lined up already to go. CSF, of course, went over the weekend. Yes. But on the other hand, mark to market can create its own debt spiral, right? And this is something we discovered in the aftermath of 2008, when hedge funds marked the market, it actually made the crisis worse. So I'm not sure you could have avoided the crisis. The original set, it's still the original set, right? It's not going to go away. So it might have happened sooner. It might have been more gradual. Maybe they'd have found a cushion. Maybe they'd have found a buyer. But I think that in this looking at an Excel spreadsheet. It's a traditional banking spreadsheet. And you have an analyst projecting a growth rate of 50%, compounded annual growth rate of 50% for the next 10 years, an operating margin of 20% in the year 10, which is twice the industry average, a low reinvestment given the growth, and a cost to capital of 70%. So all you see are the numbers. You're seeing this high growth rate, a the market is big enough and growing fast enough. What kind of competitive advantages are you assuming for the company? Strong or weak? They've been really strong. And in terms of capital intensity of the business, low capital intensity? Low capital intensity. And finally, is the nature of the product discretionary or non-discretionary? What gives it away? What's easy is the cost of capital. I'm going to ask you some questions about what might cause your story to change. So in other words, you turn in your valuation next week, you feel pretty good. I'd say it looks good. What could cause your valuation to change between next week and May 8th, which is when the fund will grow? Could an earnings report about the company change your story? Sure, right? Most of the time it doesn't. It might have small, but it could change your story. What about macroeconomic factors? Hey, look at what's happening around. It could change your story. here and there. It's a given. It's a feature evaluation. So get ready for some volatility, especially in the market. And finally, let's talk about life cycle. I gave you the corporate life cycle. Startup is like a baby, then you have toddlers, teenagers, and mature companies, and declining companies. Every valuation is a mix of stories and growth confidence. Whereas mature companies, you can get away being a spreadsheet engine. You can take historical data projected out. You're writing book of code. It's not much of a... How much divergence in story can you get? The story, I mean, the way I described it, you're in chapter 33 of a 35 chapter book. There's not a whole lot you can do to change the characters. If you're a young company, be ready to tell stories. So don't be too hard on yourself and say, look, I could about stock-based compensation. It is part of compensation. It is an expense. It should lower your income. And we're talking about the best ways to deal with management options. So you can value them as options using the option pricing model. The pushback you would get, of course, is that traditional option pricing model would never be designed for employee options because employee options are long-term. The listed options and traditional option pricing model value are short-term. Traditional options, stock price goes up 50%. You made the right guess, right? Two weeks from now, remember, you still have a couple of months left of the option. Will you exercise the option or is there a better choice? What would you do instead? You'd sell. Why? Because you always get the time premium. So with listed options, you almost never get early exercise. You see, so most option pricing models are designed to value what are called European options. with employee options. No, you can't sell it. You're stuck with it. So if you think the market price is too high, what are you going to do then? You're going to exercise the option. Employee options are more likely to be exercised early. So unlike listed options where 98% of options get held through expiration, with employee options, you can exercise halfway through, no, 60% of the way through. And that was the excuse that accountants gave price is actually $10, but instead of using a $10 stock price, I use a dilution adjusted price, where I say that because of these options, there's a dilution effect, and it's actually a pretty mechanical calculation. The price I use is $9.58, even though the actual price is $10. Let me pause right there. By using a lower stock price than the actual stock price, what am I going to do to value the option? I'm going to lower the value of equity that I got, subtract out the value of the options, say that was my equity you gave away to the CEO, which gives me a low value to the equity. And I divide what's left by the actual number of shares of the standard. The reason I emphasize that is don't double count. using an option pricing model is showing it as an expense in the year you grant and that's the right thing to do. But to show you that doing the right thing doesn't always lead to the right practice, what are analysts doing to counter this? The stock-based compensation, so accountants go to all this trouble of valuing option grants as expenses, reducing your earnings with stock-based compensation. What are analysts doing that kind of reverses the process? restricted stock? Not necessarily, right? The extent that a company might grant options in the future, give restricted stock in the future, you have to reduce future income for those future grants. And people say, isn't that double counting? You're reducing the value of the equity? No, it's for two separate effects. When I reduce the value of effect for existing options, I'm bringing in the deadweight cost of what you've done in the past. When I reduce your future earnings, it's for what I expect you to do in the future. And you can see that companies like Cisco are a little messy. You've got to value the options, reduce the value of equity, and then divide by the actual number of shares outstanding. Either way, you're reducing your equity value when you grant options to your employees or restrict them. So now let's turn to one of the themes I started this class with. I described valuation as a bridge between stories and knowledge. And I also made the confession that when I first started teaching this class, I'll end up in a spreadsheet grinding through knowledge because that's where my natural instincts are going to take me. This five-step process, you can come up with your own process for bringing in both sides, but this works for me. It might my first experience with Valiant Uber in June 2013. I'll set the stage. It was an Wall Street Journal story that drew my attention to Uber. The story basically said a company called Uber had raised $3 billion from venture capitalists and priced the company at $7 billion. Notice the word I used, priced the company, right? Because we talk about how VC know nothing about the company. So guess who I call first? I call my son, but he was still sleeping. It was 1130 in the morning. He kept what I call college student hours, which basically means it's got nothing to do with the sun coming up and the sun going down. wait so i download the app sitting upstairs in my office i hit the app magical things start to happen on my phone and gps opens up and i see a car trying to get why in new york city you don't get from point a to point b you just try you zig and you zag and you know all kinds of streets are blocked off you can see the car zigging and zagging and i can see the name george the car the driver i've never seen this with the yellow cab i'm fascinated so 15 minutes later george and his to earn a second income to supplement my basic. Why do you need Uber? He said, in New York City, it's illegal to stop on the streets and offer somebody a ride. That's actually true. There's gypsy cab rules that were written 100 years ago. He said, Uber connects me with customers. I said, that's interesting. The 30-minute lady drops me off. I offered to pay her. He says, no, you don't have to pay me. I said, it's free. He said, no, it's not free. awake and I decided to put him on the defensive right away. I acted like I knew what Uber was right from the beginning even though I didn't say. I noticed you're using a ride sharing app and using my credit card to back it up. Why would you be why do you need ride sharing if you have a car with you? He actually owned a car. He said dad on Friday nights and Saturday nights I really like Uber. As a parent there's some hollow questions you don't ask A little bit of a disadvantage. The second is, this is a business with networking benefits. People use this as a buzzword. But what's the essence of a business with networking? No. Benefits. Yeah. you're going to go where the customers are which is and if you're a customer downloading an app for a ride-sharing company guess which one you're going to go to you're going to go with the big so the larger you get the easier it gets to grow the networking benefits and they were first in the game so they much there. That was my start to this process. It's setting the landscape. This is what the company is. This is what it does. And this is the business it's in. It's the car service business. It's not a new business. It's been around. It just changed the way the business is run. Second stop of the process. When I got done with learning what I did about Uber by talking to my son, my niece, and Uber drivers reason at all. Keep it simple. I'll tell you what I don't want to see as your story. I don't want to see Game of Thrones. You don't have eight seasons and 80 episodes to tell your story. You have 15 minutes. You want to keep it simple and you want to keep it focused. What's your end game for every business? No matter what kind of business you have, what's your end game? What do you have to convince me as an investing partner? can see to make it my goal. Keep it focused. And finally, stay grounded in reality. So when you tell a story, I'm going to make sure that you're not telling me a fairy tale because as a founder, you have this incentive to make your story big and grand and amazing. And it's my job to be the Kevin O'Leary of this universe and bring you back. I'm not going to talk about licensing deals, but you know what I'm talking about. Basically talk about, hey, this is what the world looks like and this is the story you're telling. Tell In my story, I described Uber as an urban car service company. Every word here is going to have consequences. What does the urban mean? I see Uber succeeding in cities and big towns as a car service business, which will bring in new users into that business. People like my son and my niece who might never have taken a yellow cab are more likely to take. So it's going to bring in new users with local networking benefits. market share of the total market, my story was local networking. And I did assume in 2014 that Uber could keep doing what they were doing, which is keep 20% of the revenues. Completely arbitrary, right? I don't think Travis Galakne came up with 20%. Travis Galakne was a founder of Uber. I'm sure he was at dinner one night with a venture captain who was trying to raise money from the check game. Knowing Travis, he got the VC to pick up First, is it possible? Second test, is it plausible? Third test, is it probable? Sounds like I'm playing on words, right? Possible, plausible, probable. Let months before the World Cup. So I ask, is it possible that Brazil will win the World Cup? You asked 300 Brazilians six months before a World Cup. Is it possible that Brazil will win the World Cup? What do you think the answer is? Of course, we won it five times before. I said, is it plausible that Brazil will win the World Cup? Now, if I had asked this question in December of 2014, Now you could see the wheels going to the right group and Neymar stays healthy and he doesn't flip and flop and do whatever he does on the pitch. Now you can see with each one you're upping the end. And I want you to do the same thing with your story. Is it possible? Make sure you're not telling your friend. Is it plausible? Is it probable? So let me take you through impossible stories, implausible stories and improbable stories to make sure you're not falling into one of those. Let's start with impossible stories. To see why it was hopelessly conflicted, you know who the largest shareholder in Tesla is, right? A guy called Elon Musk. He was buying share, you know, Tesla was buying SolarCity, you know who the largest shareholder in SolarCity was? A guy called Elon Musk. What a coincidence, same name, same guy actually, the largest shareholder. You know, the CEO of Tesla was a guy called Elon Musk. The CEO of SolarCity was a guy called Musk with a different first name, his nephew, his cousin, whatever it is. And when you do a fairness opinion, it becomes part of the public domain. It gets filed. So I go through the filings, look for the bankers. And I'm willing to cut all kinds of slack because I know bankers have to bend all the rules. So I look at the valuation of Tesla done by Avocor. Because remember, the next age offer, you've got to value what comes. So they come up with all these projected numbers. And they get to year 10. And they project a 6% growth rate forever. Netflix is always a fascinating company to buy. So in the middle of the semester, I asked people to turn in their valuation for feedback. He turns in his valuation. He's projecting $600 billion in revenues for Netflix. I said, can you come in and talk to me? And he did. So I said, do you have Netflix? He said, yes. And I said, how much do you pay per year? And he said, about $100. I said, I'm seeing revenues of $600 billion. are. This is an impossible valuation. This is what happens. You let growth rates run amok and you let it project up. So take a look at your revenues in year 10. Not in year 1, not in year 3. Year 10, make sure you're not projecting out revenues that exceed the total marketable now. I've seen valuations where people cut costs. It's feasible, right? Efficiency growth. They do it in year 1, year 2, then you get to year 10 and keep cutting costs. You've got a problem. A math problem, which is you cut costs, your margins improve, your I'll give you an example. A company that grows without reinvesting. Now, normally it's that can't happen. But if you're an infrastructure company, you spent the last 20 years building toll roads, you can get growth for the next 10 years without reinvestment because you're living off past reinvestment. I'm looking for an explanation for what doesn't make sense. Or a company whose margins are much a very special kind. And finally, with improbable, I'm going to introduce what I find very useful when I do valuation. I'm going to give away what I'm going to do when you send me your Excel spreadsheets for sales. investment, high reinvestment or low reinvestment? I'd expect to see high reinvestment. I want to check your cost of capital. Remember I said the median cost of capital for a global company is about nine to nine and a half percent. Usually when you have high growth and high reinvestment, you're probably also going to have high risk. High, high, high. I'm going to say, okay, that's consistent. I'm not saying it's correct, but it's consistent. Low, low, low, consistent. But if you have high growth with low reinvestment and a low cost of capital, I'm going to look for a reason. back to my uber story my original uber story was it's an urban car service company that brings in new users into the business and has local networking benefits it was a very easy story to defend why by 2014 uber already succeeded in parts of the world bay area for instance they had very clear example on the ground that they were able to get car service business away from traditional taxi cabs they were drawing in users so every part of the story i have an easy that you so want to be true, that you're willing to suspend all questioning. I call these runaway stories. And I'll tell you the pieces that go to runaway story. First, the storyteller is charismatic and likable. You want the storyteller to win. Second, he or she is telling a story about disrupting a business you've never liked. You always hated the business. They're going to disrupt that business. And to add some icing on the cake, they're going to make the doors open nurse like nurse ratchet from one floor the conclusion has come up come on drops of your blood, not two buckets, but two drops in nanotainers. This already sounds incredibly fancy. And 45 minutes later, she's going to email you the results almost like she's in the 21st century. And the whole thing will cost you only $50. And by the way, she's going to give away these blood tests for free. The Cleveland Clinic, one of the premier health care entities in the US, that said, this looks promising. This looks right. Walgreens said they were going to have a Theranos lab in every Walgreens. It looked like the entire establishment had bought it. Even in the middle of 2015, you'd ask me what I thought about Theranos. My reaction is I don't know much about the company. It's privately owned. But given the fact that everybody's, not just VCs, it's Walgreens, it's the Cleveland Clinic, it's something here. has Theranos been approved for these 32 tests they claim on their web page they can do with the nanotainers? And the FDA said, no, they've been approved for one of the 32. And he said, how come? He said, well, the tests are kind of noisy. What's a noisy blood test? Trust me, you do not want a noisy blood test. Because here's what the results look like. You might be dying or you might not. Don't worry about it. Go home. We'll tell you in a few months, right? You want precise blood tests. and so this doesn't end well but if you think about the ingredients here you can see why it happened in October 2015 I actually wrote about Theranos and the question I was asking was now everybody in hindsight said I'd have seen in color and I said really I mean June of 2015 Elizabeth Holmes was one of the most celebrated business women on the face of this earth I remember she came to New York we gave a talk therei's mother being shot in the woods. That must have gone through psychologists and psychiatrists who are strong. My point is when you face these stories that build up that momentum, it's very difficult to be the person who raises the tough questions. Often you get the self-selection bias where people clean it. It's not the same phenomenon as we work, right? Adam Newman's company, how that. In a period of eight weeks, the company's pricing went from $90 billion to zero. Shows you how quickly these stories can unravel. But that's really what you're checking against, is to make's suppose you're one of those entrepreneurs and you think you can go up this market. I'm going to ask you a generic characteristic of entrepreneurs, and you can choose not to answer the question. Are entrepreneurs tend to be shy, diffident people or overconfident people? You've got to be almost overconfident to be an entrepreneur, right? So you're an overconfident because you think you can conquer that big market. You go after VC. Venture capitalists tend to be far bigger than the actual market. It happened in the dot-com boom. It happened with online advertising. It's happening right now with AI and cloud business. And guess what? It will continue to happen as long as we have markets and we're going after what we see as big opportunities. I call this the big market delusion, which is there's a big market, therefore to be overconfident, overconfident to start these businesses and write these businesses. In fact, what you see here is the online advertising business. This was in 2015. What I did was I took the market cap of every company that made money in online advertising and I had a reverse engineer from the market cap what the revenues would have to be in your debt. You can do this with your own spreadsheet. You can solve for what the revenues in your debt have to be to give you the market price today. I did this with every company. You can see already the seats of cloud business was there a few years ago, it's starting to fade. Now it's the AI business, we don't know what the next big business will be. You can see this phenomenon there. This is the definition of a bubble, right? You're creating a bubble because you see a big market and then the bubble bursts and you get reality check. I actually wrote a piece that actually got me a bit of pushback, but what's so wrong with those? What's your turn? Would you want to live in a world run by actuaries? access to what the flights would look like and they would get you the right flight and you pay them a few hundred dollars for this privilege. Let's face it, the dot-com movement bus changed the way we live. Online advertising changed the way we live. Artificial intelligence changed the way we live. But that doesn't necessarily mean that every company involved in space is going to make money. We need to stop mistaking big markets for big I came up with what I thought was a pretty upbeat valuation at that time. But Tesla at that time was also one of the most widely touted stocks in the world. So after I finished my valuation, I came up with the value of $150 per share. I see an equity research report from this well-known equity research analyst in Tesla, and he's come upvered free cash flow. That's really free cash flow of the firm. It's just a different word for free cash flow of the firm. And there's his net income, which is something like an after-tax operating income. I looked at the difference between those two now. So all these indicated line items are his reinvestment. So I added up his income for the next 15 years and his free cash flow of the firm for the next 15 years. The difference between those two numbers is what he's reinvesting. And I had a problem, you know, I've been looking at your equity research report. There are some questions about your B.C. That's what he called this. He said, I can't answer those questions. I said, why not? He said, well, I don't do the number. I said, I'm a team. You have an entire team that turned out to be a team of six. So I take him through and he very quickly, in Frank's case, he very quickly sees the problem. And he said, you know, what happened? He said, it slipped my mind. I said, what slipped your mind? He said, putting in the reinvestment. I just took last year's capex and depreciation and just projected it out. In other words, you're doing what trading the street teaches you to do, right? Take the insert spreadsheet, project numbers out. And in the previous year, capex had been very close to depreciation. You projected the numbers out. very inefficiently laid out factory like chocolate rivers running through the stuff which churns out these chocolates that are sold all over the world and when I came out of that movie when I was younger and I saw the movie my big question was how does one factory have the capacity to produce all these chocolates and the answer is actually in the book that it is mythical creatures called Oompa Loompas you get a chance go on Google and look at the breaking of the bank. So is it possible? Is it plausible? Is it probable? Let me return to my Tesla story. I'm now going to take my story and convert it now. What did I describe Tesla as? An urban car service company, right? So what's the market it's going to go after? The urban car service market. How big is it? Nobody knew until that point. I looked everywhere. And finally, the reason nobody knew was $100 billion projected by the motor. Somehow it's become this total market size that if they only knew how I did this and how many pieces I had to guess, they wouldn't be so sure about the number. So I'm saying don't trust market size on that you might find on Google search local net worth and benefits. And there are going to be a dozen different ride-sharing companies controlling different parts of it. I did give Uber an operating margin of 40%. Why? It's an intermediary business. In steady state, once they stop giving you promotions, they should have pretty high margins. Because they don't own the cars and they don't essentially have any capital intensity. I did another city for Uber. It's almost costless. The way this showed up is I gave them a sales And I have Instagram for this year. You can see what the median is, what the 10% is, what the 9%. I went to the 90th percentile. And I said, it's a risky company. Rather than finessing the cost of capital, I'm going to give it the cost of capital of a risky company. And in 2014, that cost of capital was 12%. That was the 90th percentile. And is there a chance we will not make it? Remember, it's still a money-losing small company with a potential regulatory roadmap. to questions about inputs and evaluation is a story that justifies that. The evaluation that I got from Uber with the failure rate built in was about 6%. What is the Wall Street Journal story that attracted attention from Uber in the first place? The VCs that priced it at 17 billion. I put this up at 3.30 on Friday afternoon. 3.45 I get a call from a Wall Street Journal reporter. time of frustration. If somebody asks you why is somebody paying 23,000 in Bitcoin unless you're the person who paid it, don't really have to explain it. People will pay whatever they want. So you're telling me they're wrong. I'm saying with my story and my valuation, I won't invest more. But maybe they have a bigger story.
