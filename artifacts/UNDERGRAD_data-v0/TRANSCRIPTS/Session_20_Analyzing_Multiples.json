  "text": " Thank you. look The second row, you better hear me. The mic's working. You just have to kind of quiet down so you can hear it better. So today we're going to look under the hood of pricing, see what drives pricing. And I'm going to repeat something I said in the last session that I'll probably repeat again in future sessions. low growth. You want low growth and I'm sorry, high growth and low PE. And you want low risk or high risk, low risk and low return equity or high return equity, high return equity, right? So you want that mismatch. I want you to keep thinking about those mismatches because today I'm going to introduce you to four other multiples. And with each one at the end of the multiple, I'm going to ask you for the mismatch, peg ratios, price to book will tend to trade at the lowest multiples of revenues? Discount retailers. And what is it about discount retailers that leads them to trade at low multiples of revenues? They sell at low prices. So if they sell at low prices, they have low margins. With every multiple, to drive how we think about brand names. So yesterday I went on the CVS website looking for aspirin. Not that I needed aspirin, but I wanted to see if I decided to buy aspirin, what it would cost me. And I found the CVS aspirin and the Bayer aspirin, both coded, both 100 tablets, both 325 milligrams. There's the Bayer aspirin 869. There's the CVS aspirin 429. Exactly the same ingredients, right? Why is the Bayer aspirin priced higher? Because that's what the value of a brand name is. We're going to use that difference in margin between a brand name company and a generic company to drive how much the brand names work. Lots of agendas. Let me shut off the start of the class. Let's go back. I think slide 18 is where I left you. So let's go back to that slide. rule books. Buy companies for less than six times EBITDA. Is six times EBITDA cheap? Depends on the time. In 2010, by six times EBITDA, half of all US companies traded at less than six times EBITDA. Markets were down after the crisis. That's a very strange definition of cheapness, right? Half of all stocks traded less than that. It could be cheap in 2023 unless you happen to be in Japan. So define, describe. Let's move to analyze. There are two questions I need to answer. Anytime you use a multiple. The first is, what are the variables that drive this multiple? Remember, I said every time you use a multiple, whether you like it or not, you're making implicit assumptions about cash flows, growth and risk. Today, I'm going to make them explicit. These are the variables that drive P. ratio or EB to EBITDA or any multiple. I come to you with a multiple. First decision you got to make is, is it an equity multiple or an enterprise value multiple? Equity multiples, you usually have market cap in the numerator, PE ratio, price to book, et cetera. intrinsic value model that gives you the PE ratio. So it's an equity multiple. Go back to the simplest equity valuation model you can think of. Do a little bit of algebra and you can tell me what the variables are that drive an equity model. If it's an enterprise value multiple, go back to the simplest enterprise value equation or model you can think of. Stable growth, free cash flow to the firm model. Do a little bit of algebra and you've now uncovered the three variables that drive P ratio. The payout ratio, the cost of equity, the expected growth rate. It comes directly out of the dividend discount model what if i have a company with high growth the next page is going to look intimidating at first sight but don't let the equation intimidate you can i write the value of a company when it has high growth yes in two pieces the first part of the equation is the present value of dividends during my high growth phase this is a two-stage dividend discount model that if i did is there a way you can use calculus and you know to kind of answer that question what am i asking you how does p-e ratio changes growth trust me i'm not going to ask you to do the calculus it's the first derivative right of p-e to growth rate i. So I'm not going to ask you to do calculus. I'm going to use this equation in a much more simplistic way. I'm going to give you a hypothetical company. It's a company that has high growth, 15% growth for the next five years, and then after that it's going to grow one and a half percent a year in perpetuity. For the cost of equity during the high growth phase. 92.5% payout ratio, 1.5% growth rate, and a 6.5% cost of equity, the stable growth phase. Stay in there for a moment. If you stay with those numbers, I get an answer of 29. You're to talk about how PE ratios behaved over the last decade in the US and why PE ratios today are lower than they were just two years ago. It's got nothing to do with stocks being overpriced or underpriced. It's movements in the risk-free rate. So if this company were priced on an intrinsic value basis, it should trade at 29.15 times earnings. Let's say you trust me, go buy this company. It's a high growth company, right? What's your nightmare scenario? You pay a high PE for a high growth company. Thank God we're not there yet, but we know there are countries like Turkey where it's 15%. So across every interest rate, every risk-free rate, as my growth gets lower, my PE ratio gets lower. But take a look at how much of an effect changes in growth have on your PE ratio as risk- free rates change. As risk-free there. What's the value of growth? It's all in the future, right? The higher my risk-free rate, holding all else constant, what happens to the value of growth for every company? It gets lower. Let's take this extreme scenario. Let's say in Brazil in 1992, lower risk-free rates. So it'll be interesting to see whether this year, when you get an earnings announcement and you get a surprise, you have a smaller effect on stock prices than you did a year ago for the very simple reason that risk-free rates today are 3.5% and they were 1.5% a year ago. We'll see. But again, you're getting for companies with high risk and low growth. I'm not saying, again, you avoid these companies, but if you just load up your portfolio with low P-E ratio companies, guess what you're going to end up holding for the most part? You're going to hold a lot of investment dogs because they're going to look cheap to you. That's why we be the ones that revert back to the mean. One final thing. Let's say the CEO of a company which has high growth and high risk. There are two ways you can try to increase your question. Maybe instead of focusing on higher growth, we should be trying to make our earnings more predictable, more stable, a risk lower, because the payoff is much greater. One final question. It's hypothetical. I said, okay, I've looked at beta, I've looked at growth rates and risk. What would happen to this company if its return and equity were different? Again, I'm trying to counter this proposition that if you have two companies with the same growth rate to be pointless because we can do a discounted cash flow model directly. We're using these equations to understand what drives multiples so we can ask the right questions. We can screen for the right variables if we decide to use pricing. So any questions on PE ratios? So I'm going to play a little game. I'm going to show you a bunch of different choices that I'm going to make have low P.E. ratios deserve to have low P.E. ratios. These are countries that have low P.E. ratios, but they're not cheap because they're very risky countries. So what's a mismatch you're looking for? You want a country with a low P.E. ratio and not that much risk, right? I looked at this list. Maybe the closest you get is Slovenia. you can make sense of it. We're talking about an eight, 10 year history. And if you have markets that go on an extended run, they can look incredibly good just before they crash. I mean, I think though it is true, India and China have had much higher P ratios than the rest of the world. And on one hand, you're saying that doesn't make sense. They have higher risk, but on the other hand, they also have higher growth and the growth has offset the risk and, you know, in a sense, push the P ratio you have, the less volatile a market can look. It doesn't mean they're not risky companies. It just means you don't see it in the traditional measures of volatility. So you'd like to control for differences across countries, right? So I'm going to take you back to an example from way, way back in time, about 20 years ago. I went and pulled up a bunch of what were then emerging country. So if I'm looking for a mismatcher, I want a country with a low P, low interest rates. I want high growth and low risk, right? You can see already eyeballing this data is just going to make you dizzy. This is where I said statistics can help you. So I opened up my statistics textbook to the multiple regression chapter. Remind me again what we do in multiple regression. We have a dependent variable we try to explain, right? As growth goes up, my PE ratios increase. And as country risk increases, my PE ratios decline. This is good news. You know why? Because all of the science are consistent with what I expected to see. Don't get used to this. Because when you try this on your companies, on regressions, science is sometimes going to go in the opposite direction. You can't fight the data. That's what the data is telling you. You've got to use it. Here at Cleese, I'm getting data that gift horse in the mouth. So I'm okay. And I'll later talk about how high does an R squared have to be to be okay. And I'm going to argue that it's a wrong statistic to focus on, but basically that's what the output does. Now here's how I'm going toared of 73 percent play out here? When I give you this predicted value, yeah, yes, something like that is really different. But but so are these predicted P. So if you get, I know I would send you the P ratio for every country if you're interested at the start of 2023. I can send you the PRS score, which is the risk score for every country. So you can have the risk score. And then you want to put in real growth and interest rates. It's easy to pull off the IMF, the World Bank databases. You can do this across 160 countries. How would you use it? As a global portfolio manager, this might become the basis investors have viewed this as a red flag. They've stayed out of the market for the last decade. Why? Because the argument is P ratio looks too high. Here are four variants of the P ratio. First is your basic P ratio. Take the price at the level of the index divided by trailing earnings in the last 12 months. That's a P ratio. Say, what's a normalized P? You take average earnings across time because you're worried about last year being an unusual year. So not a big deal. But the last year, right? What's your alternative? If you think stocks are too expensive, what was your alternative? Putting your money into bonds, right? Let's say you put into T-bonds. You know, very simplistic way, what I was trying to argue is, you can't just look at the P-E ratio of a stock, say they're high and say don't buy stocks, because then I'm going to put my money in bonds that make 2%. I'm actually doing worse off than I did 10 years ago when I bought stocks at 15 times earnings. And think about it as making choices. I can either invest in T-bonds and make 4% or invest in stocks with an earnings yield of 5%. So what are you going to see on the next graph? The red line is the earnings price ratio. The green line is the T-bond rate. So let me start with the easy question. Do the two look like they move together? Most of the time, right? You think, what's this purple line? That's a difference between the T-bond rate and the T-bill rate. The T-bond is a 10-year bond. The T-bill is a I have the T-bond rate, the level of rates, and I have a measure of economic growth, at least as seen through the eyes of the yield curve. My first stop was, again, statistical. I said, I can see three numbers here. I want to see, at least at first sight, it looks like T-bond rates and stock and PE ratios move together. I have much lower PE ratios, a much higher earnings price ratios. Why? Because when you have a flatter downward sloping yield curve, you have lower growth. And basically that leads to lower PE ratios. Again, my end game here is to tell you whether stocks are overpriced or underpriced today. So let me try to do that. By taking this 33 or 43 year history and running a regression of earnings price ratios of the S&P increase in the T-bond rate will increase my earnings price ratio by 1.6%. Earnings price ratio goes up by 1.6%. I'm going to trade at a much lower PE ratio. You can now quantify the effect of what do higher interest rates mean for stocks. When you look at the difference between the T-bond and the T-bond rate, the coefficient is negative, but it comes with a catch. See these numbers in brackets below my coefficients? What do they measure? And if I look at T bond rates, clearly 7.28. I'm way above 2.3. So this is, if you ask me, is there a significant relationship between T bond rates and earnings to price ratios? Of course. There's no debate. Do you ask me, is there a significant relationship between earnings to price ratios and and say, the yield curve is downward sloping, therefore the economy goes into recession. Now, let's suppose I gave you this equation right there. That's an updated equation. R squared of 46%, not bad. I'm trying to explain changes in PE ratios across time using only two variables. 0.5. Given where rates are today and the slope of the yield curve today, I would expect the PE ratio for the S&P 500 to be about 16.5. It's actually trading at about 17.3 times earnings. Shouting distance, right? So if you want to make a case that stocks are overpriced today, you better make a case that's going to come from a different place with a different argument. As opposed to what? Remember we did an intrinsic valuation of the S&P 500. We had to do these elaborate dances about earnings and cash flows and payout ratios. It's a far simpler exercise. You're saying given what the history of pricing is, are stocks underpriced or overpriced? Any questions? I'm going to move on from P ratios to a ratio called the PEG ratio was invented? In the 1970s, a guy called Peter Lynch, you might have heard about him, legendary investors, and he was the first person to run Fidelity Magellan, which is the first growth mutual fund. So he's given this mission of start a growth mutual fund, invest only in growth companies. And he ran into a bit of a problem because at that time, the only tool that investors had to pick cheap companies was PE ratios. So the origins of the PEG ratio are, hey, we want to pick high growth companies. We can't do it by just looking at PE ratios. We've got to create this concoction, the PEG ratio. And now there are a lot of tech analysts who've latched on. They use the PEG ratio to pick stocks. Now I want to introduce a note of caution here. The argument that many analysts use for using PEG ratios is they argue that growth is now out of the going to go back and look at how peg ratios play out when you look at a hypothetical company. But let's take the parts of the equation that are still readable. Holding all its constant as I increase the risk in a company, what should happen to the peg ratio for the company? Is that the same growth rate? The peg ratio should go down or it should go down? So to kind of illustrate that, I'm going to go back to the same example I used for PE ratios. Remember the high growth company to 15% growth for the next five years? I computed the PEG ratio for the company. And remember, this is an intrinsic two-stage dividend discount model applied to the company. The PEG ratio I end up with for this company, given its characteristics, is 1.94. This stock should trade at 1.94 times growth in, hey, that shows this company is cheap. It's PEG ratio is lower than the PEG ratio for the S&P 500. You see what the problem with that is, right? You've got a risky company. It should look cheap on a PEG ratio basis. If you want to compare it, you should be probably comparing it to the PEG ratio of other risky software companies. And then you can tell me the company is cheap or expensive. But you can't compare companies with different degrees of's almost a U-shaped relationship. Initially, as growth goes up, peg ratios decrease, but then they start increasing. You might say, who cares? Help me out on a perfect underpriced stock at a peg ratio basis. You want a low peg ratio, right? You want low risk or high risk? You want low risk because high risk would explain it away. You want low is an abysmal multiple. The fact that people use it doesn't make it okay, precisely because of this very, very, very strange relationship it has with growth. So I know why people use peg ratios, but I'm very, very quick, I question anytime I see a company labeled as cheap or expensive on a peg ratio basis, exactly what I found with that peg ratio, you need to ask the question, what are the returns on equity in this company? Does that explain away the low PEG ratio? And with growth, as I said, all bets belief that book value and liquidation value are somehow interchangeable, which is silly because if you think about the book value of most companies, you're not going to get that liquidation. It doesn't even mean much, but price to book, it's been around for as long as people have been investing, comparing what you pay in the market price to book ratio. And I allow you only one question. That question should always be, what's the return equity at this company? Because most of the time when something trades at a low multiple of book value, it's because it is an abysmally low return equity. But I can actually take this equation for the price to book and simplify it. Remember when we talked about sustainable growth? Does anybody remember what the growth in earnings per share was written as in equal to the cost of equity. If you start trading at less than book value, it's because its return equity is less than the cost of equity. If it trades at well above book value, it's because it has a return equity well above the cost of equity. Price to book ratios are a function of return equity and cost of equity. Now, if I wanted to take the price to book, of course, it's an equity multiple. If I wanted to give you the enterprise value analog to this, instead of price, what am I going to do? Return on capital minus the growth rate divided by cost of capital minus the growth rate. Everything we talked about, excess returns, how they value growth, depends on how much, that plays out here. It's exactly the same effect playing out in a month. So with price earnings, it's growth, payout, and risk. With peg ratio, it's growth, payout, and risk, but growth has a strange relationship. With price to book, it's growth, payout, risk, and return on equity. With enterprise value invested capital, And there are good reasons and bad reasons for why you've seen a shift away from P to EB to EBITDA. Give me some of the know that your PE ratios tend to swing from very low to very high numbers for L11 companies. Third, remember when I showed you the distribution for PE ratios, I started with 7,000 something companies and ended up with 3,000. And why did I throw out 4,000? Because they had negative net income. Some companies have negative EBITDA of 10 most of us have no sense of what a high or a low number so you know what happens is as human beings when you don't have a frame of reference guess what you compare it to you know you shouldn't be doing it but 10 looks like in the market. It's not even the unsophisticated. Most of us are unsophisticated. If I went around, would you consider yourself unsophisticated? I would wager if you went to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, or you walked into an investment bank, and you walked around asking bankers, what's the median EB debita for the market? Not one of them will know the multiples. They look cheap. Because you're not used to using those numbers, you don't have a frame of reference of those numbers. So for better or worse, we're surrounded by EV to EBITDA. So I want to give you the tools to address what are the questions I need to ask when somebody tries to sell me something based on EV to EBITDA. So, again, by now, you know the trick, right? list out the variables that drive EBITDA. In your mind, I want you to start thinking about what a cheap company will look like on an EBITDA-EBITDA basis. First up is your tax rate. The higher your tax rate, the lower your EBITDA-EBITDA is going to be as a company. Notice when we did PE ratios, we didn't care about tax rates, right? Why when you use PE ratios, do you not care about tax rates? But when you use EBITDA-EBITDA, you've got to care about taxes. item we had in our valuation where those three items got consolidated the procedure that's my reinvestment holding all its constants the more my reinvestment is for any given growth rate the lower my ev debit is going to be why because if i'm reinvesting more to deliver the same growth rate i'm being less efficient so tax rates matter reinvestment matters go to the denominator holding all its constant the higher my cost of capital the lower my ev debit are riskier And finally, when you look at reinvestment, for a given growth rate, I want as low a reinvestment as I can find. So when you look at companies again, you're trying to find that combination that makes for a cheap company, because a lot of companies that trade at low EBITDA multiples have terrible returns on capital, have reinvested huge amounts or have high costs of capital, which explains why they trade at the multiples that they do. You know what that number would look like if that is 0% tax rate? Be 16 times EBITDA. If the tax rate were 50%, it'll be less than six times EBITDA. You're saying, when would I ever have differences in tax rates like those? Let's say you decide to become or you get hired to become the telecom analyst for Europe. Think of who's in your sector. You've got Deutsche Telekom, which is roughly 30% tax rate. You have Irish Telekom, whichDA, a low tax rate, low reinvestment, and a high return on capital. Because that's going to be the company that's really cheap. It's not a company that deserves to be cheap. I know you guys are exhausted. Last multiple. no debt, don't fall into the trap of using price to sales, even though it might seem simpler, because it's just internally inconsistent. The EV to sales. What do you think the companion variable is for EV to sales? I think you gave it away, because when we did that discount retailers, what did we say it was? It's margins. So when I do the algebra, and I'll save you, I won't torture you by going through the algebra again, but if youCola. Called me and he said, you know, can you come into Atlanta and talk to our management team about the value of a brand name? They're kind of obsessed about brand name valued Coca-Cola. And they want to get a number because they know accountants are going to try to put a number. And I said, sure. So I showed up and the management team had gathered together and I finished the valuation. First in the front row, head marketing honcho, Coca-Cola puts up his hand. He says, well, you forgot something very important. I forget a beverage, a geography. So what did I forget? You've forgotten the fact that Coca-Cola is one of the most valuable brand names in the world. I said, what exactly do you want me to do? He said, you should be adding at least a 20% premium. I said, why? He said, because that's what we do at Coca-Cola. coming entirely from brand name. You know what he said? I don't believe you. This is what happens when you argue with marketing people. This is exactly the kind of response you get. But I came prepared. I knew this question was coming and I got lucky. I found a company called Cot. It's a Canadian company that sells almost as many cans of soda as Coca-Cola does. You've never heard of it, right? You walk into a grocery store, you know the generic sodas that you find? So here's what I did. I took Coca-Cola. I'm not comparing Coca-Cola with Cod. I'm comparing Coca-Cola with Coca-Cola without its branding, giving it generic margins. It has a ripple effect. Lower margins can tell he shows up at his mother's house for dinner all the time. So he walks into the kitchen. This is how the commercial goes, plays out. And the mother's at the kitchen, stirring this big pot of spaghetti sauce surrounded by empty bottles of ragu. He says, mom, what are you doing? You used to make spaghetti sauce from scratch. Why are you making it out of a bottle? And he starts listing out the",
