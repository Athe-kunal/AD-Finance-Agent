  "text": " \u0414\u044f\u043a\u0443\u044e. um evaluation, you got to get it to me by when? A week from Friday, which happens to be the last day of this month. A couple of things on evaluation. Have your attention, please. It's on. If I make it any louder, I get too much of feedback. to build your own spreadsheet, I won't stop you, but it does make my life more difficult. So I'm okay with that because it does mean I have to check your mechanics to make sure you're not adding something which you should be subtracting. The alternative is to take my spreadsheet and adapt it. So if you feel that it's not flexible enough, you want to add an extra five years and make it 15 years, you want to add three line items revenues, hey, the spreadsheet is adaptable. It's nothing proprietary about it. So feel free to do that. Or is it the start of the next calendar year? Maybe it's the end of 2023. What do you think the answer to that is? When you do a DCR value, what do you get? I know that timing and consistency is right. Your risk-free rate, your risk-free might be as of right now. But you're saying, what about the value, $150 per share. What would I need to do to convert it into a target price? It's all in your Excel, in that valuation of all the inputs you need. What do you need to do? Back up, back up. It's, you've come up with a value per share. That's an equity value. interview saying you want just one year i can give you target price in five years ten years it looked like magic but basically all you're doing is taking your value per share and moving it across time so if you valued a company three years ago at fifty dollars and the stock right now is sixty five dollars you actually were very close to the right answer then because you take the fifty dollars and you grow the market cost of equity you're at sixty five dollars right now so remember valuation of a company. Nobody does. Nobody has the high ground on this. You have your story, your valuation. You know what it's going to drive? My decisions. So you don't like my story? Tell your own. That is really the lesson I wanted to take away from this is this is not my story for you to make decisions. It's my story for my own decisions. I'm almost done. So I finished my story. Riverside. Nate Silver used to be the polling person for the New York Times, and then he split off. He created his own company. It's now, I think, owned by ABC. It's really a statistical geek set. I'll give you an example of what they do. You've heard of the hot hand in basketball, but when somebody starts shooting and the ball keeps going, he's got a hot hand. So they say, is that true? They actually take the data and say, is it true that when somebody is actually They've always been skeptical about how these tech companies are being priced. Can we carry the post? I said, be my guest. Same post, same valuation gets carried. Then I get a third call on the same day. It's from a site called TechCrunch. What is TechCrunch? TechCrunch is a digital magazine for Silicon Valley. It's read by tech geeks. They said, our people are not finance people, but they're interested in Uber. Some of them work at Uber. Some of them own shares very different sets of feedback. On the 538.com site, this is the kind of feedback I get. I looked at the evaluation. I noticed it used the 90th percentile of the cost of capital. But the 90th percentile is 11.97%. You seem to have used 12%. Why? This is what happens when numbers geeks get too close to numbers, right? Second decimal point matters. value one of ours with your D.C.F. We don't do that in Silicon Valley. So some of them are pure insults. Some of the insults I didn't even get. You DCF guy, that was one of the insults. That's it, the whole thing. You DCF guy, I said, that was good. Is that bad? Okay, I'll take it. But after you got past the first 100 insults, the 101st comment started with an insult. And then they went to the ride-sharing guy's side. And I learned some very interesting things about Uber, things I would never have learned if I just talked to the top management. In all my years of value companies, I've never talked to top management. You're going to see in a minute why. I heard from an Uber driver in LA. And he said, I noticed you used the 20% share of the fare as their revenue, which is what Uber told investors. They can't. He said, in LA, here's what's happening. weeks after this feedback kicks in, I'm on a trip to Europe. I'm stuck in Munich airport waiting for a flight and it's delayed. And I make the mistake of opening up my email and checking to see what the emails that have come in are. And I noticed I have an email from a gentleman named Bill Gurley. Have any of you heard of Bill? He's a partner at Benchmark Capital, 21st century. And he said, I've said some mean things about you and I just wanted to let you know. Sincerely, Bill. I closed the email. Two hours left on my flight. Guess where I go next? I go to the site called Above the Crowd. That's Bill's site. He's six feet, six inches tall. That is Above the Crowd. I must be below the crowd then. I should rename my site. And here's the lead article. You can still find it on Google Search. If you type Demodran Mrs. Byamai. Get it? Uber driving And finally, he said, we're trying to connect up with airlines and credit card companies so that when you fly out of New York on United to Jakarta, after you make your reservation, there will be a little box that says, do you have an Uber car waiting for you in Jakarta? A very clever way of saying, we're going to take our domination in New York and translate it. It's a way of making your local networking benefits into global networking benefits. Took me 15 minutes to read the post. I was fascinated. potential market. But that 10% market share I gave because of local networking benefits, there are global networking benefits, there'll be three ride-sharing companies dominating the world. They gave them a 40% market share. The value that I got was 53 billion. So still sitting in Munich Airport, this is a long way, I sent the Excel spreadsheet back to Bill and said, do you like this more? He said, a lot. And he said, by growth rate. I don't know. I said, finally, you know what? That's my story. You want to make it your story? I'll do a do-it-yourself valuation of Tesla. And here's what I did. I said, you pick the story. So at each stage, I would stop and say, you tell me what business Uber is in. Is it a car service business? Is it a logistics business? Is it a transportation business? Or is it an on-demand business? So what's an on-demand business? You need something in for you. But basically, they're taking advantage of the fact that how people value time is very different, that somebody might value their time more. GoCheck will do it for you. If you get a chance, even if you're not valueing GoCheck, take a look at the company. Their ride sharing is actually guys on motorcycles and scooters. You know why, right? If you've ever seen Jakarta traffic, you can get in a car. valuation because you can get any value you want. That's not the way I read it. The way I read it is, especially with young companies, there can be significant disagreements about value. And those disagreements are not about your growth rate is different from mine. It's because we're telling different stories about the same company. Let's make that debate about the story. It's a much healthier debate than my saying, I use 50% growth fact, it's too much like meat. It's like gross-looking meat, but if you like medium-rare, you get the medium-rare feeling. And I'll tell you see my potential market is because let's face it uber has changed the car service business in ways that i did not see in because this is my research. I'm thinking of actually writing off all my Uber rights as a tax-deductible expense. I'm doing research. Come on. I am doing research, right? In fact, I used Disney in my applied corporate finance class as my lab experiment, and I spent four days in Disney World. Maybe I can write off everything I spent in Disney. Why did you spend $20 on the corn dog? I had to do research. pharmaceutical company with a drug working its way through the pipeline for diabetes, and you attach a high value expecting big revenues. And then you open up the Wall Street Journal on Monday, and it says the most recent test of that drug, three people have died and the drug's been pulled off the test. There goes your company, right? Oh, here's another example. You had a company called Ashley Madison. It's a company for cheaters. People want to cheat on their spouses, can't, right? But Ashley Madison, big issue. That's a story break. You can have your story shift. What does that mean? Your basic story stays the same, but the contours of the story change. Revenue growth might go up, margins might change because of things happening around you. I've told pretty much the same because everybody has a smartphone and you either have to get somebody with a with an android phone to switch to you or get somebody to upgrade and you're not going to get that 20 dramatic. An Apple Watch can't do it. You see why? The collective total market for the Apple Watch, even if everybody had an Apple Watch, it's like $100 billion. When you're a $2 trillion or $2.5 trillion company, having a market of $100 billion is like any change. You got to have... So once you get to I look at Apple. The only business that's kind of altered a little bit my story for Apple is the growth of the Apple services business, which is everything that flows through the App Store is incredibly profitable to Apple. It's in fact the reason that who is it that had a problem with which Fortnite, I think, had to pull the game off because Apple takes a slice. If that's a big business, it could potentially alter the value of the company. So what I'm trying to say is you get a story, you get a valuation, but you're keeping your eye open for what could change that story. Story shifts, story changes. And story breaks. Any questions on storytelling? OK, well, how many? This on when I did the valuation, the equity risk premium reflects the equity risk premium as of that point in time. So pre-2000, pre-1998, I used to use a lot of five and a half percent premiums. Some of the time they provide power to most of the city. All these lights are Con Ed lights. It's a regulated utility. What does that mean? It's a regulated monopoly, actually. And they're the only game in town. Now, of course, part. And how quickly is New York City's, New York State's population growing? It's not, it's a mature, it's a mature part of the country in terms of population size. This is all going to lead in to what I'm going to do. I'm going to value Con Ed as a stable growth. Why? Because it's not like power usage is going to go up 10, 15%. They can't afford it. They don't have the capacity to even, they'll actually talk you down if you try to use it, though, you've got to pass some tests to make sure it is a company. So with Con Ed, here are the tests I read. First is, is this company paying dividends like a mature, stable growth company? What am I looking for? I'm looking to see whether the payout ratio is high enough to be compatible with it. If I see a payout ratio of 10%, I know already1% growth rate in perpetuity is going to be, so they're paying dividends like a mature company. They're growing at a rate less than the growth rate of the economy. Final question to ask is, is their beta and cost of equity compatible with a mature company? What does that mean? If I see a beta 1.8 and a debt ratio of bond as you're going to get in the stock market, right? It's a big dividend-paying company with low growth. I'm not surprised, but I'm still finding the company to be slightly undervalued, right? So let's take that exercise we did at the start of the class about what will the price be one year from now. The value per share for the company is 42.3, right? That's my discounted cash flow value. If I asked you what the target price will be one price is 4076 and I'm buying it at 40 that doesn't sound like much money it's only a dollar but if you go out and buy the stock now you're going to pay 4076 if you actually end up with 44 dollars and something which is what you should if your if your value is right you're going to end up with a return of about 13 percent on Con Ed and if you can make a 13 percent return on Con Ed you're way ahead of the game so if you want to convert discounted cash flow valuation to deliver. It's like solving for any number. Usually we solve for a discount rate, call that the IRR, but you can solve for any input you want. In this case, one of the things that I did was I did change the growth rate for the company to see what growth rate I would need to get to the stock price. It's called an imputed growth rate, but you can then use it to decide how much buffer you have in your estimate. So this is an easy valuation. very many of you are going to be able to use a stable growth dividend to start more. But the second company I'm going to value is going to be a little more difficult, but not that much more so. It's a company called 3M. What does 3M do? Incredibly boring things that make a ton of money. Like that amazing post-it note. The guy who invented this. Imagine, I mean, if he actually got the claim in every post-it note, crisis. I would love to tell you that I saw it coming, not even on my rise. Maybe Nouriel saw it coming, but he sees it coming all the time. Nouriel Roubini is looking out his window, he sees a crisis coming, Bitcoin collapsing, but he's like Eeyore, he sees crises around every corner. So I value the company, completely oblivious to the storm approach. Two weeks later, I'm valuing 3M again. None of the numbers for the company have changed. Same financials. But the world around me has changed. There's this canard that intrinsic value is timeless. That somehow once you value a company, it can't change. What absolute nonsense. Because when the world changes around you, your intrinsic value will change. And in a crisis, what are the first things that are going to shift? Your risk premiums. they write more and more notes to themselves. They don't be depressed, do things. So that's, but the growth drops off. So think about the effect. Same company, four weeks later in a crisis, I use a higher discount rate reflecting the higher price of risk. Lower growth rate in perpetuity, risk-free rates have come down and a lower growth rate. The value that I get per share is $61. Think about it. I've taken the same company with the same numbers You have a higher cost of capital. If you're in a crisis, the T-bond rate might drop. But remember, that has ripple effects on your growth rate in perpetuity. Now, be willing to adapt when things change around you because your value per share will change. It's a good exercise to go through. Nothing else to allow you to see how macro variables affect. And now, how many of you are valuing banks? How many are valuing banks here? Anybody valuing a bank? capital requirements and how much your return equity is. So if you're valuing a bank, over the last week your value has shifted for no fault of your bank, but because the world around them has changed. We'll do one more valuation to kind of clean up this process. So I valued 3M, I valued Conant, they're both companies, right? Can I value the S&P 500? Can I value an index? 2022, inflation had now become this leading player in the game. The index was down and I wanted to see whether the index was under or overvalued, given all the macro news. So as I looked at the basic index, here's how I'm going to build up to get my expected earnings in future years. I want to start with my base year earnings and I'm going to apply a growth rate. It's very similar to what I did with the implied equity risk premiums. There I was solving for the equity risk premium. Here I'm going to try of 2022. The way I'm getting estimates of growth is I'm looking at what analysts are predicting, the future. And by September of 2022, there was talk that a recession was coming. So the big question is, are analysts incorporating the expected effects of a recession sufficiently, or are they overestimating growth? So that's the first question. Second, with inflation becoming a bigger player And finally, given that higher inflation usually goes with more uncertainty about inflation, what will that mean for the equity risk? Those are the four big questions. So let's start with the earnings question. So these are the earnings estimates that analysts were projecting for the S&P 500 and the percentage change those earnings. So basically, I'm saying how much are analysts weighing? Because we started 2022 with nobody talking about a recession. percentage of the S&P 500 earnings that gets paid out in dividends and buybacks over time. So in 2001, U.S. companies, that's the dot-com bust year, returned about 41% of their earnings in dividends and buybacks. Across the entire period, that statistic is about, if you look at the percentage that's paid out, has been about 83%. So over the 2000 through 2022 earnings. The earnings are going to be lower than they're projecting for whatever reason they seem. So I'm going to use earnings that are lower than the analyst estimates. I do believe that companies can't afford to continue to return cash the way they were in the 12 months leading to September 2022. Why? They were turning almost 90% of earnings in dividends and buybacks. With higher inflation, more uncertain inflation, I'm going to assume it's going to be about 80%. And it's going to happen over time. I did assume that over the long term, that I got for the index was actually pretty close to where the index was then. I came up with an index value of 3550. Put differently, analysts might be over-optimistic. They might be biased upwards in their earnings, but guess what the market is doing? It's incorporating more realistic assumptions about earnings. So don't mistake analysts for the market. There's this amazing thing that seems to happen. And that's what I, so if you want an update, I have a January 2023 update of my valuation. But the bottom line is this value is a function of my assumption, the function of what I'm assuming what will happen to inflation and what will happen to the economy. So this table actually, what I did was I essentially took what could happen to earnings you might say look I've done research, people might be ignoring this, what the heck can I come up with on the S&P 500 that the crowd already has in the sense? That's at the core of do you want to time markets or not? Can I value in markets? Yes. Will I act on those valuations? No, I don't feel there's anything special that I'm bringing other than an understanding why markets are where they are. But if you want you can download income statement, balance sheet statement of cash flow of the company, that's the answer you're looking for. What are my existing investments ranking? That's the easiest of four questions to answer. Second question is, what is the value that is added or taken away by future growth? Why did I phrase the question that way? Why did I just ask you, what's your future growth? Because growth is a mixed blessing, right? Higher growth pushes up my earnings and cash flows. Higher growth comes with reinvestment. you can use the terminal value calculation the growth rate is less than the growth rate so i'm going to state the obvious when those questions are easy to answer valuation becomes easy when those questions are difficult to answer value this is so obvious why are you even wasting our time telling you that when you take a company like coca-cola what makes it easy to value take those four questions you have lots of information on cash flows from existing assets assessing the you know what's the big deal R&D which is a capex is treated as an operating expense I can't remember all that the process we had to go through to capitalize expenses and finally companies that face significant truncation what is truncation risk now you do valuation you estimate cash flows in year 3 you wonder is my year 3 cash flow going to be right or wrong or how wrong is it you know what tr mean by that? A mature company is trying to become different. It's trying to do something different. How do you deal with the changes that are coming? And finally, I'm going to value declining companies. These are the companies where after you value them, you feel like you need built on a premise. It was built on two premises. The first premise is banks were run by sensible people. And the second is that banks were covered by regulatory authorities would stop banks from doing really stupid things. You see why it was 2005. That illusion lasted until 2008 when we woke up to a nightmare of Cyclical companies the same way. So I'm going to talk about valuing those companies. And finally, companies with intangible assets. We talked about capitalizing R&D. I want to show you the implications of capitalizing R&D on the value of a company like Angell. So we have a lot on our plate. Let's get the process started at least. I want you to be an entrepreneur and you've just created this young company. It's a startup. Lots of promise. You ready? So you're the entrepreneur. I'm going to come and out of the chair laughing. You don't even know whether you'll make it through next week. You have no cash to meet payroll. Now do you see why most people don't even try to value young companies? Every input becomes this exercise and I have no idea. And let's make this even worse. basically looked at industry averages. So you look at the company, you look at its history to see what it did during the last recession, you look at complements. One by one, I'm going to knock your crutches out. Let's suppose you're a young company, you don't have much history. It's a young company very early in the life cycles, current financials tell you very little. And then you look at the sector, they're all companies just like you're, it basically understood that what worked in the US and Europe would not work in China. In fact, I think the best description I saw of Alibaba when it went public was the economist described it as opening side, put on sunglasses before you do, because it'll be like a bang in your face. But in a sense, Alibaba said, this is what Chinese consumers want. Is there one at Bazaar? And they created Alipay because they discovered that Chinese consumers were a little reluctant in those days, leave credit card information on a site because they were afraid you'd rip them off. tomorrow or two or two days from now will you come on and talk to you know talk to us about it and they never told me and not like all you know there's a room called the green room which is neither green nor a room but this is like the terminology they use you come and wait there at some point in time it must have been green in the room but you go to cnbc they make you wait there i sit there and this guy walks in and he's an equity research i've seen him on tv before he says what are you here for i said talk about alibaba he said oh that's a coincidence i'm talking about alibaba I basically can't explain what's going on. So I'll call it a paradigm shift. I've heard in my 40 years in finance, I've seen seven different paradigm shifts, none of which actually stuck. And finally, you're going to see metrics you've never seen before. Like what? When dotcom companies took off, none of the traditional metrics worked. high. $300 per eyeball. I really like my eyeballs. I would definitely pay at least $300. But you can see when you create these metrics that you've never seen before, you have no frame of reference. If I ask you to pay 500 times revenues for a company, you're going to balk, right? So that's a high number. 5,000 times earning. No, I'm not doing it. $300 per eyeball. Oh, you know what? That sounds low. Let me just buy. That's the downside. in 1997 for the first time. And I kept a journal of my experiences of what I felt and what I had to deal with at every step. It's still on my website. It's called The Dark Side Evaluation. Can Amazon.com be valued? That, of course, became the book four years later about valuing dot-com companies. And the second edition and the third edition have come out. And basically, I've discovered the dark side lurks any time you face a lot of uncertainty. Of course I got the numbers. Absolutely wrong. But I'm actually going to show you my comparison of what my projections were in 2000 to what actually happened over the following 10 years. I seldom do this because it can create psychological trauma to actually look at your forecast and the actual numbers, but I'm going to do it anyway. So this is a valuation of Amazon January 2000. I actually did this for, I don't have a CFA, What were Walmart's revenues last year? 500 billion. And in 2000, Walmart's revenues were 150, 200 billion. Gap at 20 billion. I mean, basically, 1 billion is tiny revenue. And operating losses are 410 million. So this is a company with small revenues and big operating losses. You ready? Here's my question. spreadsheet because that small revenue becomes big revenue to revenue growth and a target margin. I know you're not going to get there next year, but what do you think your company can make once it gets past the pain? This is my revenue growth, 42% compounded revenue growth rate every year for the next 10 years. I remember when I was doing this at my web bigger, you can't maintain those growth rates. I thought I was big. I was and I talk about why 42 percent. Why not 45? Why not 36? So small revenues, big revenues. After my job is done, I made Amazon, at least in my spreadsheet, a big company in terms of revenue. Second, I had to pick a margin that they would have in steady step. You say, why don't you just look at online retailer margins? You know what that number would look like, right? and do on spreadsheets? Why would anybody want to run a real company just doing on a spreadsheet? You can make your company the biggest company ever. But there's one final loose end, and I end with this loose end. To get your revenues from a billion to 40 billion would require not just sweat and tears, but also reinvestment. And I'll tell you, this is where I got stuck when I first started value young companies. I tried that reinvestment times return on capital. You know what that looks like for Amazon? three, which means for every $3 in additional revenues, I need to invest in daughter and son. The advantage of doing this instead of forecasting CapEx and working capital and acquisitions is I don't know what Amazon will have to reinvest in two younger companies. Jeff Bezos did not know in 2000 what he'd have to reinvest. When in doubt, consolidate. That's why when I do my young company valuation, I actually have fewer line items than",
