Generally speaking, we use the interest rate on government securities to estimate the riskfree rate, assuming that such securities have no default risk. While this may be a safe assumption in the United States and other developed markets, it may be inappropriate in many emerging markets, where governments themselves are viewed as capable of defaulting. In such cases, the government bond rate will include a premium for default risk and this premium will have to be removed to arrive at a riskfree rate. 3", "page_num": 25, "coordinates": [[249.9955555555554, 198.90000000000012], [249.9955555555554, 582.2333333333335], [1454.028564453125, 582.2333333333335], [1454.028564453125, 198.90000000000012]]}, {"text": "b.

This discrepancy was attributed to limitations in the testing techniques.

In other words, all that any test of the CAPM could show was that the model worked (or did not) given the proxy used for the market portfolio.

The relationship between risk and growth can be illustrated in two ways. The first is by computing the PE ratio for a hypothetical firm, holding growth and cashflows constant, but varying the risk.14 In figure 9.18 below, for instance, we vary the beta of a stock with an expected growth rate of 25% for five years and 8% forever therafter, and compute the PEG ratio:", "page_num": 299, "coordinates": [[249.9955555555554, 198.90000000000012], [249.9955555555554, 532.2333333333335], [1452.798888888889, 532.2333333333335], [1452.798888888889, 198.90000000000012]]}, {"text": "Figure 9.18: PEG Ratios and Beta: Firm with 25% growth for next 5 years, 8% thereafter", "page_num": 299, "coordinates": [[397.5975646972656, 579.6671444444444], [397.5975646972656, 604.1560333333333], [1293.786376953125, 604.1560333333333], [1293.786376953125, 579.6671444444444]]}, {"text": "14 To do this, you first have to compute the PE ratio based upon fundamentals and then divide by the expected growth rate.

The mean relative absolute error, which measures the absolute difference between the actual earnings and the forecast for the next quarter, in percentage terms, is smaller for analyst forecasts than it is for forecasts based upon historical data. Two other studies shed further light on the value of analysts' forecasts. A study8 in 1978 examine the relative accuracy of forecasts in the Earnings Forecaster, a publication from Standard and Poors that summarizes forecasts of earnings from more than 50 investment firms. This study measured the squared forecast errors by month of the year and computed the ratio of analyst forecast error to the forecast error from time-series models of earnings. It found that the time series models actually outperform analyst forecasts from April until August, but underperform them from September through January. The authors of the study hypothesize that this is because there is more firm-specific information available to analysts during the latter part of the year.
