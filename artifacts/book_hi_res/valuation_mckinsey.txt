As we illustrated in Chapter 2, the conversion of revenues into cash flows\u2014and earnings\u2014is a function of a company\u2019s return on invested capital (ROIC) and its revenue growth.

Few companies discuss multiple scenarios, preferring a single-point forecast on which to base a yes-or-no decision. Most companies would simply represent the expected cash flows from this project as being $1,000 per year, the amount if everything goes well, and allow for uncertainty in the cash flow by arbitrarily increasing the discount rate. While you can get to the right answer with this approach, it has two flaws. First, there is no easy way to de- termine the cost of capital that gives the correct value. In this case, using a 16.7 percent cost of capital instead of 10 percent results in a project value of $6,000 before the investment and $4,000 after the investment. But the only way to know that this is the correct value would be to conduct a thorough scenario analysis. Companies sometimes arbitrarily add a risk premium to the cost of capital, but there is no way for them to know whether the amount they add is even reasonably accurate. Second, the decision makers evaluating a project with cash flows of $1,000 per year and a 16.7 percent cost of capital are still not thinking through the 40 percent risk that it might generate no cash at all. If for some reason you must use a single cash flow scenario, you can analyt- ically estimate the equivalent risk premium for different probability levels of failure, as in Exhibit 4.3. The exhibit shows the amounts by which you would increase the cost of capital instead of using cash flow scenarios for different combinations of the probability of failure, as represented on the vertical axis, and the size of loss relative to the base case, as represented by the horizontal axis. For example, if there was a 50 percent chance of failure in which case the project would be worth 40 percent less than expected, the equivalent risk premium would be 1.5 percent. Notice in this exhibit that the risk premiums are small relative to what most people expect. To get close to a 3 percent risk premium, for example, you\u2019d have to believe there was a 50 percent chance of failure and a 60 percent reduction in cash flows associated with failure. To get to a 5 percent risk premium, you\u2019d have to believe there is a 50 percent chance of failure and more than an 80 percent reduction in cash flows.9", "page_num": 82, "coordinates": [[72.0, 182.28650000000005], [72.0, 569.7574999999999], [434.6804999999998, 569.7574999999999], [434.6804999999998, 182.28650000000005]]}, {"text": "Adding ad hoc risk premiums is a crude way to include project-specific un- certainty in a valuation.

A crucial issue for investors and executives to understand, however, is that a company whose TSR has consistently outperformed the market will reach a point where the company will no longer be able to satisfy expectations reflected in its share price. From that point, TSR will be lower than it was in the past, even though the company may still be creating huge amounts of value. Managers need to realize and communicate to their boards and to investors that a small decline in TSR is better for shareholders in the long run at this juncture than a desper- ate attempt to maintain TSR through ill-advised acquisitions or new ventures. This was arguably the point that Home Depot had reached in 1999. Earlier, we used earnings multiples to express expectations, but you can also translate those multiples into the revenue growth rate and ROIC required to satisfy current shareholder expectations by reverse engineering the share price. Such an exercise can also help managers assess their performance plans and spot any gaps between their likely outcome and the market\u2019s expectations.

That means the evidence tends not to support beliefs that value is shaped as much by other measures. Even some of the most conventional beliefs about the stock market are not supported by the facts. For example, most growth and value indexes, like those of Standard & Poor\u2019s, categorize companies as either \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201cgrowth\u201d based on a combi- nation of factors, including market-to-book ratios and price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es). Typically, companies with high market-to-book ratios and high P/Es end up in the growth category, while the others fall in the value category. How- ever, growth is only one factor driving differences in market-to-book ratios and P/Es. ROIC also is important. In fact, we have found no difference in the distribution of growth rates between so-called value and growth stocks (see Exhibit 7.2). We did, however, find that so-called growth stocks tend to have high ROIC, and value stocks have lower ROIC.

By discounting pretax cash flow at the pretax cost of capital, you implicitly assume capital investments are tax deductible when made, not as they are depreciated. Furthermore, working- capital investments, such as accounts receivable and inventory, are never tax deductible. Selling a product at a profit, rather than holding inventory, is what leads to incremental taxes. By discounting pretax cash flow at the pretax cost of capital, you incorrectly assume that investments in operat- ing working capital are tax deductible. Finally, it can be shown that even when net investment equals depreciation, the result will be downward bi- ased\u2014and the larger the cost of capital, the larger the bias.

Today, only acquired intangibles are capitalized and amortized, while internally generated intangible assets, such as brand and distribution net- works, are expensed when they are created.

These are important because invested capital is fixed over the next several years, and labor and raw materials costs per unit are very high. In contrast, Exhibit 29.6 shows a value driver tree for a grocery retailer. In this very different example, the key value drivers for gross margin are the aver- age basket size (the number of transactions per square foot is important but al- ways has an upper limit) and the markdown percentage on product prices. For operating costs, labor productivity is key, as most other components are fixed in the near term. Similarly, within invested capital, inventory level is one of the key value drivers; again, most other components are fixed in the near term. How do you tailor the tree to get such insights? Our experience has taught us that developing different initial versions of trees based on different hy- potheses and business knowledge will stimulate the identification of uncon- ventional sources of value.

For example, most consumer electronics companies have con- centrated their manufacturing, R&D, and brand-advertising activities in a handful of locations. The invested capital and costs of these centralized ac- tivities are largely independent of what happens in individual product and market segments (say, single-serve coffee machines in Southern California). Although some companies allocate the centralized capital and costs to indi- vidual segments by their sales volumes or sales revenues, this has little eco- nomic relevance.11 Furthermore, segment managers have little or no control over the efficiency of the centralized activities. In situations like these, it is more effective to set targets for underlying value drivers such as market share growth, gross margin, and inventory levels rather than return on capital. Of course, companies should ensure that the targets are consistent with driving aggregate return on invested capital of the business units and divisions en- compassing the segments. At some point, expansion of market share and sales will require additional production capacity.

The acquirer pays a total price of $650 million, including a premium of 30 per- cent. We calculate the estimated discounted-cash-flow (DCF) values after the transaction under two scenarios: (1) a downside scenario in which the value of operating improvements is $50 million lower than the premium paid, and (2) an upside scenario in which the value of these improvements is $50 million higher than the premium.

Continual ad- justment would be impractical and costly, due to share price volatility and transaction costs.7", "page_num": 661, "coordinates": [[72.0, 312.29449999999997], [72.0, 491.7905], [434.64900000000006, 491.7905], [434.64900000000006, 312.29449999999997]]}, {"text": "For decades, academic researchers have sought to learn which debt-to-equity ratio represents the best trade-off between flexibility and efficiency and maxi- mizes value for shareholders.

This is the case in sectors such as software, biotechnology, and high-tech start-ups. Potential tax savings are small, because their taxable profits are low in the near term. Management needs more financial freedom, because investments are essential to capture future growth. In contrast, the costs of business erosion are high, because these companies would quickly lose valuable growth opportunities, and any remaining assets have very little value to third parties. For the same reasons, companies with more volatile earnings and higher advertising and R&D costs are generally financed with less debt.18 Leverage also tends to be low for companies producing durable goods, such as machinery and equip- ment, requiring long-term maintenance and support.
