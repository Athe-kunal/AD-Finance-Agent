First, markets sometimes over react to disappointing news from good companies, even though the news may not have really have significant long term value consequences. For instance, assume that Coca Cola reports lower earnings per share because of foreign currency movements (stronger dollar reduces the value of foreign earnings) while also reporting strong operating results (higher revenues, more units sold etc.). If the market price for Coca Cola drops dramatically, it would represent an over reaction since exchange rate effects tend to smooth out over time. You may be able to buy the stock at a bargain price, before it bounces back up. Second, entire sectors or even markets may be marked down in response to bad news about a few companies in the sector or market. In 2002, for example, all energy companies lost a significant proportion of value because of disastrous happenings at a few of them (Enron and WorldCom). If there are well managed energy companies in the sector, as there inevitably will be, you may be able to get them at a low price when the sector is down. The same can be said for well managed and well run companies in emerging markets that fluctuate as a result of political and economic trouble at the country level. In 2002, for instance, exceptionally well run Brazilian companies lost 40 to 50% of their value because of Brazil\u2019s perceived instability.

When firms announce changes in dividend policy, they are conveying information to markets, whether they intend to or not. An increase in dividends is generally viewed as a positive signal, since firms that make these commitments to investors must believe that they have the capacity to generate these cash flows in the future. Decreasing dividends is a negative signal, largely because firms are reluctant to cut dividends. Thus, when a firm cuts or eliminates dividends, markets see it as an indication that this firm is in substantial and long-term financial trouble. Consequently, such actions lead to a drop in stock prices. The empirical evidence, cited in Chapter 2, concerning price reactions to dividend increases and decreases is consistent, at least on average, with this signaling theory. On average, stock prices go up when dividends are increased and go down when dividends are decreased, though the price reaction to the latter seems much more.!!
