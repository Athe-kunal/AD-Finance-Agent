[{"text": "Risk is part of every human endeavor. From the moment we get up in the morning, drive or take public transportation to get to school or to work until we get back into our beds (and perhaps even afterwards), we are exposed to risks of different degrees. What makes the study of risk fascinating is that while some of this risk bearing may not be completely voluntary, we seek out some risks on our own (speeding on the highways or gambling, for instance) and enjoy them. While some of these risks may seem trivial, others make a significant difference in the way we live our lives. On a loftier note, it can be argued that every major advance in human civilization, from the caveman\u2019s invention of tools to gene therapy, has been made possible because someone was willing to take a risk and challenge the status quo.

The first of these axioms, titled comparability or completeness, requires that the alternative gambles or choices be comparable and that individuals be able to specify their preferences for each one. The second, termed transitivity, requires that if an individual prefers A to B and B to C, she has to prefer A to C. The third, referred to as the independence axiom specifies that the outcomes in each lottery or gamble are independent of each other. This is perhaps the most important and the most controversial of the choice axioms. Essentially, we are assuming that the preference between two lotteries will be unaffected, if they are combined in the same way with a third lottery. In other words, if we prefer lottery A to lottery B, we are assuming that combining both lotteries with a third lottery C will not alter our preferences. The fourth axiom, measurability, requires that the probability of different outcomes within each gamble be measurable with a probability. Finally, the ranking axiom, presupposes that if an individual ranks outcomes B and C between A and D, the probabilities that would yield gambles on which he would indifferent (between B and A&D and C and A&D) have to be consistent with the rankings. What these axioms allowed Von Neumann and Morgenstern to do was to derive expected utility functions for gambles that were linear functions of the probabilities of the expected utility of the individual outcomes.

To see why, assume that there is only one factor and three portfolios. Portfolio A has a beta of 2.0 and an expected return on 20%; portfolio B has a beta of 1.0 and an expected return of 12%; and portfolio C has a beta of 1.5 and an expected return on 14%. Note that the investor can put half of his wealth in portfolio A and half in portfolio B and end up with a portfolio with a beta of 1.5 and an expected return of 16%. Consequently no investor will choose to hold portfolio C until the prices of assets in that portfolio drop and the expected return increases to 16%. By the same rationale, the expected returns on every portfolio should be a linear function of the beta. If they were not, we could combine two other portfolios, one with a higher beta and one with a lower beta, to earn a higher return than the portfolio in question, creating an opportunity for arbitrage.

We could use different risk- adjusted discount rates for each set of cash flows; for instance, revenues and variable operating expenses can be discounted at the cost of capital whereas fixed operating expenses, where the firm may have pre-committed to making the payments, can be discounted back at a lower rate (such as the cost of debt).

While some analysts get around this by discounting negative cash flows at the riskfree rate (or a low rate variant) and positive cash flows at the risk adjusted discount rate, they are being internally inconsistent in the way they deal with risk. In our view, any value benefits that accrue from discounting negative cash flows at the risk adjusted rate will be more than lost when the eventual positive cash flows are discounted back at the same risk adjusted rate, compounded over time.

In practice, there are two ways in which this analysis can be structured. In the first, each input into asset value is set to its best (or worst) possible outcome and the cash flows estimated with those values. Thus, when valuing a firm, you may set the revenue growth rate and operating margin at the highest possible level while setting the discount rate at its lowest level, and compute the value as the best-case scenario. The problem with this approach is that it may not be feasible; after all, to get the high revenue growth, the firm may have to lower prices and accept lower margins. In the second, the best possible scenario is defined in terms of what is feasible while allowing for the relationship between the inputs. Thus, instead of assuming that revenue growth and margins will both be maximized, we will choose that combination of growth and margin that is feasible and yields the best outcome.

Double counting of risk: As with the best case/ worst case analysis, there is the danger that decision makers will double count risk when they do scenario analysis. Thus, an analyst, looking at the Boeing Super Jumbo jet analysis, may decide to reject the investment, even though the value of the investment (estimated using the risk adjusted discount rate) exceeds the cost at the expected production of 125 planes, because there is a significant probability (30%) that the sales will fall below the break even of 115 planes. Since the expected value is already risk adjusted, this would represent a double counting of potentially the same risk or risk that should not be a factor in the decision in the first place (because it is diversifiable).", "page_num": 161, "coordinates": [[250.0, 840.333223263889], [250.0, 1335.6664996527777], [1458.3333439861108, 1335.6664996527777], [1458.3333439861108, 840.333223263889]]}, {"text": "In some projects and assets, risk is not only discrete but is sequential.

Many simulation packages available for personal computers now provide a rich array of distributions to choose from, but picking the right distribution and the parameters for the distribution remains difficult for two reasons. The first is that few inputs that we see in practice meet the stringent requirements that statistical distributions demand; revenue growth, for instance, cannot be normally distributed because the lowest value it can take on is -100%. Consequently, we have to settle for statistical distributions that are close enough to the real distribution that the resulting errors will not wreak havoc on our conclusion. The second is that the parameters still need to be estimated, once the distribution is picked.

As we noted in an earlier section, we are faced with dozens of risks, of different types and with different consequences and some of these risks matter far more than others.

There are some risks that you may be able to reduce or eliminate through the normal course of your operations and thus are costless to hedge, but there are other risks that are costly to hedge. For these risks, the choice becomes complicated especially for publicly traded companies, since they have to compare the costs that they, as companies, would face to the costs that investors in their companies would face to eliminate the same risks. It is this comparison that would lead us to conclude that publicly traded firms are usually better off passing through a significant portion of their firm- specific risk and even exchange rate risk to their investors, rather than incur costs to hedge them.

It is true that in an efficient market, stock price and the value of equity move hand in hand, but there are two problems with a stock-price focus. The first is that in an inefficient market, where investors may focus on the short term or on the wrong variables (earnings variability, for instance) there may be a positive market response to poor risk management decisions. That response will fade over time, but the managers who made the decisions would have been rewarded and have moved on (or up) by then. The second is that the value of a business includes the value of its equity and other claimholders in the firm (lenders, in particular).
