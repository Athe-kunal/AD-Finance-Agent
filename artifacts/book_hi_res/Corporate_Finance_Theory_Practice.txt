The problem is not so much the cost of money as it is making money available by reducing working capital in order to invest, to repay debt or to constitute a war chest. The problem is also not having money when the company needs it. In other words, managing working capital is a timeless problem, even if some situations are better than others for highlighting the issue; finally, it is a source of risk: the risk that customers will pay late or will only pay partially or not at all because they have gone bankrupt, which could in turn create problems for the company and create a series of domino-like bankruptcies. It is to alleviate this risk that the European authorities have introduced statutory provisions to reduce payment periods to 45 days end of month or 60 days after the invoice is issued. There is also the risk of the loss of value for obsolescence of certain goods (news journals, cut flowers, yoghurt, etc.).", "page_num": 886, "coordinates": [[494.1666666666666, 277.1388888888888], [494.1666666666666, 938.2499999999999], [1436.9999999999984, 938.2499999999999], [1436.9999999999984, 277.1388888888888]]}, {"text": "From a more economic point of view, working capital can be:", "page_num": 886, "coordinates": [[442.4239501953125, 961.8907470703125], [442.4239501953125, 991.0277777777777], [1132.5361328125, 991.0277777777777], [1132.5361328125, 961.8907470703125]]}, {"text": "2 See page 645.", "page_num": 886, "coordinates": [[249.6006317138672, 1284.6497802734375], [249.6006317138672, 1308.9342041015625], [395.82222222222225, 1308.9342041015625], [395.82222222222225, 1284.6497802734375]]}, {"text": "a tool for helping customers or suppliers who are already experiencing problems as a result of a liquidity crisis.

When risk is remuner- ated at too low a rate, companies will abandon the sector, some firms will go bankrupt, the sector will consolidate or integrate (car parts makers, airline companies), which over time will reduce competition and increase earnings. We find here the same line of reasoning we saw for financial securities on which returns are too high or too low, given their risks. On industrial markets, as on financial markets, a necessary relationship arises between risk and return. On financial markets, which, by definition, are a lot more liquid than industrial markets, the balance between risk and return is established a lot earlier than on industrial markets. Entering an industrial market involves a lot more than merely buying a share, as on financial markets, and exiting is a lot more complicated than selling a share. Accordingly, there are some sectors where earnings generated may, over the long term, be higher than normal earnings, given the risk.
