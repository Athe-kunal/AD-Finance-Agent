We can value a mature company with about relatively few assumptions and be reasonably comfortable with the estimated value. Valuing a technology firm will require far more assumptions, as will valuing an emerging market company. A scientist looking at the valuations of these companies (and the associated estimation errors) may very well consider the mature company valuation the better one, since it is the more precise, and the technology firms and emerging market company valuations to be inferior because there is more uncertainty associated with the estimated values. The irony is that the payoff to valuation will actually be highest when you are most uncertain about the numbers. After all, it is not how precise a valuation is that determines its usefulness but how precise the value is relative to the investors trying to value the same estimates of other company. Anyone can value a zero coupon default-free bond with absolute precision. Valuing a young technology firm or an emerging market firm requires a blend of forecasting skills, tolerance for ambiguity, and willingness to make mistakes that many analysts do not have.

First, because the marginal gain to diversifying decreases with each additional investment, it has to be weighed off against the cost of that addition. Even with small transactions costs, there will be a point at which the costs exceed the benefits. Second, most active investors believe that they can pick undervalued stocks (i.e., stocks that will do better than the rest of the market). The CAPM is built on two key assumptions: There are no transactions costs, and investors have no access to private information (allowing them to find undervalued or overvalued stocks). In other words, it assumes away the two reasons why investors stop diversifying. By doing so, it ensures that investors will keep diversifying until they hold a piece of every traded asset\u2014the market portfolio, in CAPM parlance\u2014and will differ only in terms of how much of their wealth they invest in this market portfolio and how much in a riskless asset. It follows then that the risk of any asset becomes the risk that it adds to this market portfolio. Intuitively, if an asset moves independently of the market portfolio, it will not add much risk to the market portfolio. In other words, all of the risk in this asset is firm-specific and can be diversified away. In contrast, if an asset tends to move up when the market portfolio moves up and down when it moves down, it will add risk to the market risk and less portfolio.

Using weekly or monthly returns can reduce the nontrading bias significantly. 27 The third estimation issue relates to the choice of a market index to be used in the regression.

One common practice is to use the index that is most appropriate for the investor who is looking at the stock. Thus, if the analysis is being done for a U.S. investor, the S&P 500 index is used. This is generally not appropriate. By this rationale, an investor who owns only two stocks should use an index composed of only those stocks to estimate betas.

A number of firms, with Wal-Mart and Dell being the most prominent examples, have used this strategy to grow. While this may seem like a cost-efficient strategy, there are potential downsides. The first is that supplier credit is generally not really free. To the extent that delaying paying supplier bills may lead to the loss of cash discounts and other price breaks, firms are paying for the privilege. Thus, a firm that decides to adopt this strategy will have to compare the costs of this capital to more traditional forms of borrowing. The second is that a negative noncash working capital has generally been viewed by both accountants and ratings agencies as a source of default risk. To the extent that a firm\u2019s rating drops and interest rates paid by the firm increase, there may be costs created for other capital by using supplier credit as a source.

In most relative valuations, analysts compare the price-earnings ratios of firms in a sector, even though these firms have very different cash holdings. The preceding analysis suggests that this can often skew recommendations toward or against firms with larger cash balances. In mature sectors, where growth is low or moderate, firms with larger cash balances will trade at higher P/E ratios, not because they are overvalued but because cash commands a higher multiple of earnings than operating assets do. In high-growth sectors, firms with higher cash balances will often trade at lower price-earnings ratios, but that will not make them bargains.

In the decision tree approach, we use the cost of capital for the project as the discount rate all through the process. If the exposure to market risk, which is what determines the cost of capital, changes at each node, we can argue that using the same cost of capital all the way through is incorrect and that we should be modifying the discount rate as we move through time. If we do, we will obtain the same value with both approaches. The real-options approach does allow for far more complexity and is simpler to employ with continuous distributions (as opposed to the discrete outcomes that we assume in decision trees).", "page_num": 820, "coordinates": [[164.9600830078125, 171.01444444444445], [164.9600830078125, 644.3477777777777], [999.8432006835938, 644.3477777777777], [999.8432006835938, 171.01444444444445]]}, {"text": "CONCLUSION", "page_num": 820, "coordinates": [[164.84292602539062, 688.3477777777777], [164.84292602539062, 721.6811111111109], [381.4635009765625, 721.6811111111109], [381.4635009765625, 688.3477777777777]]}, {"text": "There are two clear points on which there is wide agreement.

When trading any asset, they are three other ingredients that go into the trading costs. The first is the spread between the price at which you can buy an asset (the dealer\u2019s ask price) and the price at which you can sell the same asset at the same point in time (the dealer\u2019s bid price). The second is the price impact that an investor can create by trading on an asset, pushing the price up when buying the asset and pushing it down while selling. The third cost, which was first proposed by Jack Treynor in his article 1 on transactions costs, is the opportunity cost associated with waiting to trade. While being a patient trader may reduce the first two components of trading cost, the waiting can cost profits both on trades that are made and in terms of trades that would have been profitable if made instantaneously but which became unprofitable as a result of the waiting.
