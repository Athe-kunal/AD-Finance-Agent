In 1977, Roll, in a seminal critique of the model's tests, suggested that since the market portfolio could never be observed, the CAPM could never be tested, and all tests of the CAPM were therefore joint tests of both the model and the market portfolio used in the tests. In other words, all that any test of the CAPM could show was that the model worked (or did not) given the proxy used for the market portfolio.

By assuming that the investors who trade at the margin are well diversified, we conclude that the risk we should be looking at with equity investments is the market risk. The different models of equity risk introduced in this chapter share this objective of measuring market risk, but they differ in the way they do it. In the capital asset pricing model, exposure to market risk is measured by a market beta, which estimates how much risk an individual investment will add to a portfolio that includes all traded assets. The arbitrage pricing model and the multi-factor model allow for multiple sources of market risk and estimate betas for an investment relative to each source. Regression or proxy models for risk look for firm characteristics, such as size, that have been correlated with high returns in the past and use these to measure market risk.

Over shorter periods, there is substantially more uncertainty about whether small stocks will outperform large stocks and whether buying losers will generate excess returns. There are no investment strategies that are sure bets for short periods. Pradhuman (2000) illustrates this phenomenon by noting that small cap stocks have underperformed large cap stocks in roughly one out of every four years in the last 50 years. Bernstein (1998) notes that while value investing (buying low PE and low Price to book value stocks) may earn excess returns over long periods, growth investing has outperformed value investing over many five-year periods during the last three decades.

First, there are some financial managers who argue that book value is more reliable than market value because it is not as volatile. While it is true that book value does not change as much as market value, this is more a reflection of book value\u2019s weakness rather than its strength since the true value of the firm changes over time as both firm- specific and market information is revealed.

This may seem surprising since the FCFE each year for the high growth period are greater than the dividends, but this effect is more than offset by the decline in the expected growth rate which is generated by the equity reinvestment rate being lower than the retention ratio. We would argue that this valuation is probably more realistic than the dividend discount model because it keeps investments in cash and marketable securities separate from investments in operating assets.

If a firm\u2019s current margins are highly correlated with future margins \u2013 a firm that has earned high margins historically will continue to do so and one that have earned low margins historically will also continue to do so \u2013 using current margins and current revenue multiples to identify under or over valued securities is reasonable. If the current margins of firms are not highly correlated with expected future margins, it is no longer appropriate to argue that firms are over valued just because they have low current margins and trade at high price to sales ratios. The second problem with this approach is that it assumes that revenue multiples are linearly related to margins. In other words, as margins double, you would expect revenue multiples to double as well. The third problem is that it ignores differences on other fundamentals, especially risk.

Microsoft made it easy for end-users to switch to its products (by allowing Excel to open Lotus spreadsheets, for instance), and it made it more and more expensive for them to switch to a competitor by creating the Microsoft Office Suite.

Thus, it is easy to gauge the inflation in medical prescription prices, but much more difficult to gauge the inflation in the prices of medical services. The second is that all inflation indices are based upon samplings of prices of goods, rather than the universe of all goods traded. Even if the sample is not biased, there is the possibility of sampling error that enters into the numbers. The third is the issue of weighting on the basis of usage value. Due to practical considerations of time and resources, the weights are not adjusted every time the inflation index is computed to allow for changes in usage. Instead index weights are adjusted infrequently, leading to biased in the measured inflation. Thus, the inflation indices which kept the usage of gasoline by households constant in the late seventies while oil prices were climbing (and people were cutting back on the use of gasoline) tended to overstate the inflation rate during that period. The final consideration is about the level at which inflation is to be measured, since counting goods at every level of the process (from commodity to manufactured good to retailed good) would result in double or even triple counting the same good.
