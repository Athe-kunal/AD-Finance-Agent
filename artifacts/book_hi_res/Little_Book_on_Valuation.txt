To illustrate, the PE ratio is a con- sistently defined multiple, since the numerator is the price per share (which is an equity value), and the denominator is earnings per share (which is also an equity value). So is the enterprise value to EBITDA multiple, since the numerator and denominator are both measures of operating assets; the enterprise value measures the market value of the operating assets of a company and the EBITDA is the cash flow generated by the operating assets.

While cash and marketable securities are by themselves neutral investments, earning a fair rate of return (a low one, but a fair one given the risk and liquidity of the investments), there are two scenarios where a large cash balance can be value destructive. The first is when cash is invested at below market rates. A firm with $2 billion in a cash balance held in a non-interest- bearing checking account is clearly hurting its stockholders. The second arises if investors are concerned that cash will be misused by management. In either case, investors will dis- count cash; a dollar in cash will be valued at less than a dollar. Returning cash to stockholders in the form of divi- dends or stock buybacks will make stockholders better off.
