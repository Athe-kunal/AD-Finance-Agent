The storytellers populate the social science classes in school and then burnish their skills by becoming history, literature, philosophy, and psychology majors. Each group learns to both fear and be suspicious of the other, and by the time they come into my valuation class as MBA students, that suspicion has deepened into a divide that seems unbridgeable.

Thus, I will describe my attempts to tell stories about Alibaba in 2013, Amazon and Uber in 2014, and Ferrari in 2015, and to convert these stories into valuations. Rather than use the royal \u201cwe\u201d and force you, as readers, to adopt my stories, I felt it would be much more honest (and more fun) to let you pick apart my stories and disagree with them. In fact, you can put this book to best use by taking my story about a company, say Uber, thinking about what parts of my story you disagree with, coming up with your story, and then valuing that company based on your story. A related peril of lay- ing bare my narratives on real companies is that the real world will deliver surprises that will make each of my narratives wrong, sometimes horren- dously so, over time.

Other research also finds that happy endings trigger the limbic portion of the brain, its reward center, to release dopamine, a trigger for hope and optimism.", "page_num": 23, "coordinates": [[170.44393920898438, 281.68310546875], [170.44393920898438, 645.577880859375], [1041.00927734375, 645.577880859375], [1041.00927734375, 281.68310546875]]}, {"text": "Greg Stephens, Lauren Silbert, and Uri Hasson have a fascinating study of how electrical impulses in the brain seem to respond to storytelling in what they term \u201cneural coupling\u2019?

They note two phenomena as the story is told. The first is that the brain waves of the storyteller and listeners synchronize, with the same parts of the brain light- ing up for both, although there is a time lag on the part of the listeners (as they process the story). To test whether it is the story itself that made the difference, the story was told in Russian (which none of the listeners under- stood), and the brain wave activity ceased, thus illustrating that it is the story (and understanding it) that seems to make the connection.

While many studies looking at hedge fund returns over time had concluded that they earned \u201cexcess\u201d returns (over and above expectations), Professor Brown argued that the mistake many analysts were making was that they were starting with the hedge funds in existence today and working backward to see what returns those funds earned over time.

The drugs generated by R&D that made it through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process and into commercial production were used to cover the aggregated cost of R&D and to generate significant excess profits. The key to this process was the pricing power enjoyed by the drug companies, the result of a well-defended patent process, significant growth in health-care spending, splintered health insurance companies, and lack of accountability for costs at every level (from patients to hospitals to the government).

Second, the government has used the buying clout of Medicaid to bargain for better prices on drugs, and while Medicare still works through insurance companies, it can put pressure on drug companies to negoti- ate lower costs.

After all, the inter- ests of the storyteller and the investor can sometimes diverge.

In my view, a good business story, that is, one that has staying power and backs up a successful business, is one in which listener and storyteller interests converge.

Its value, to its riders, comes from its screening of the drivers/ cars (to ensure both safety and comfort), its pricing/payment system (customers choose the level of service and are quoted a fare), and its convenience (you can track the car that is coming to pick you up on your phone screen).", "page_num": 94, "coordinates": [[193.9367218017578, 1164.9742431640625], [193.9367218017578, 1513.3026123046875], [998.953125, 1513.3026123046875], [998.953125, 1164.9742431640625]]}, {"text": "Figure 6.3 captures the steps in the Uber business model as I saw it in mid- 2014, with comments on what it is that Uber offers at each stage and whether that offering is unique.", "page_num": 94, "coordinates": [[188.1903839111328, 1527.69091796875], [188.1903839111328, 1621.5792236328125], [1001.2752685546875, 1621.5792236328125], [1001.2752685546875, 1527.69091796875]]}, {"text": "as the company grows.", "page_num": 95, "coordinates": [[544.0, 1188.0], [544.0, 1205.0], [719.0, 1205.0], [719.0, 1188.0]]}, {"text": "Figure 6.3 The Uber business model, June 2014.", "page_num": 95, "coordinates": [[167.79141235351562, 1253.0257568359375], [167.79141235351562, 1307.93359375], [501.8896179199219, 1307.93359375], [501.8896179199219, 1253.0257568359375]]}, {"text": "Uber had been able to grow at exponential rates since its founding in 2009, with its CEO, Travis Kalanick, claiming that it was doubling its size every six months.

The other is that these are unusual expenses, strange reasoning in companies where these expenses occur every year. There is a secondary problem that is created, especially from employee options grants in the past. These options, if still outstanding, represent a claim on the equity of the firm and have to be valued and subtracted out from the equity value to get to the value per share.

Thus, an oil company with high-cost reserves may find itself more exposed to oil price variability than one with low-cost reserves, since the company with high- cost reserves will be hurt more by lower oil prices and will benefit more from higher prices. In general, oil companies with high fixed costs will see their earnings respond more violently to oil price changes than oil compa- nies with more flexible cost structures. Finally, oil companies that hedge their output risk, that is, use futures and forward markets to lock in oil prices on future deliveries, will have earnings that are less impacted, at least in the near term, by oil price changes, than companies that do not hedge.", "page_num": 218, "coordinates": [[161.2793426513672, 1040.9197998046875], [161.2793426513672, 1619.2469482421875], [1027.9072265625, 1619.2469482421875], [1027.9072265625, 1040.9197998046875]]}, {"text": "In this third step, you will be creating a composite story, in which you bring together your assessments of both the macro variable and the characteris- tics of the company you are valuing.

In the start-up phase, investors are attracted to expansive narra- tives that can lead to big markets and are often willing to reward compa- nies with high value for big stories.

I also look at why it is critical that top managers at companies not only have clear, compelling, and credible stories to tell about their businesses at every stage in the life cycle but take actions consistent with these stories.", "page_num": 258, "coordinates": [[163.52781677246094, 886.148193359375], [163.52781677246094, 1395.032958984375], [1030.47705078125, 1395.032958984375], [1030.47705078125, 886.148193359375]]}, {"text": "A Life Cycle Perspective on Managerial Imperatives", "page_num": 258, "coordinates": [[237.44375610351562, 1481.1114501953125], [237.44375610351562, 1510.8868408203125], [945.5253295898438, 1510.8868408203125], [945.5253295898438, 1481.1114501953125]]}, {"text": "In the last chapter I introduced the corporate life cycle structure to explain how the balance between narrative and numbers shifts as a company", "page_num": 258, "coordinates": [[151.93118286132812, 1555.6495361328125], [151.93118286132812, 1622.752197265625], [1033.9447021484375, 1622.752197265625], [1033.9447021484375, 1555.6495361328125]]}, {"text": "transitions from a start-up to a growth firm and then moves to being a mature business before slipping into decline.

As the firm transitions from the idea to the business stage, the promoters of the business need to bring business-building skills into the equation to convert promise to num- bers. When the firm starts to grow, the test for managers is whether they can start delivering results that back up the story. In maturity, managers need to frame their narratives to match up to the numbers that are being delivered; continuing to tell a growth story when a company\u2019s revenues are flat will lead to a loss of credibility.
