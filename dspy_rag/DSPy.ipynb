      "['Debt-to-value, however, is in both the numerator and the denominator, so it is difficult to distinguish how leverage affects the levered P/E. To elimi- nate the debt-to-value ratio in the numerator, use a few algebraic tricks. First, multiply both the numerator and denominator by kd:Next, subtract and add 1 (a net difference of 0) in the numerator:After separating the numerator into two distinct terms, you can eliminate the components of the right-hand term by canceling them with the denomina- tor. This allows you to remove debt-to-value from the numerator:To simplify the expression further, divide both the numerator and denomina- tor of the complex fraction by kd:Finally, multiply the numerator and denominator of the second term by -1:As this final equation shows, a company’s P/E is a function of its unle- vered P/E, its cost of debt, and its debt-to-value ratio. When the unlevered P/E equals the reciprocal of the cost of debt, the numerator of the second frac- tion equals zero, and leverage has no effect on the P/E. For companies with large unlevered P/Es, P/E systematically increases with leverage. Conversely, companies with small unlevered P/Es would exhibit a drop in P/E as lever- age rises.This appendix discusses alternative models of capital structure and credit rating estimations. These models offer some interesting insights but tend to be less useful in practice for designing a company’s capital structure. Finally, the appendix shows the similarities and differences between widely used credit ratios such as leverage, coverage, and solvency.', 'In 1999, KPMG examined 700 of the most expensive deals between 1996 and 1998 and concluded that only 17% created value for the combined firm, 30% were value neutral and 53% destroyed value21.20 This study was referenced in an article titled “Merger Mayhem” that appeared in Barrons on April 20,combined firm to the performance of the relevant industry segment for a year after the deal was completed.A study22 looked at the eight largest bank mergers in 1995 and concluded that only two (Chase/Chemical, First Chicago/NBD) subsequently outperformed the bank-stock index. The largest, Wells Fargo’s acquisition of First Interstate, was a significant failure. In an incisive book on the topic in 1996 titled “The Synergy Trap”, Sirower took a detailed look at the promises and failures of synergy and drew the gloomy conclusion that synergy is often promised but seldom delivered.', 'This ratio is called the PEG ratio and is widely used by analysts and portfolio managers following growth companies.Defining the PEG RatioThe PEG ratio is defined to be the price earnings ratio divided by the expected growth rate in earnings per share:For instance, a firm with a PE ratio of 40 and a growth rate of 50% is estimated to have a PEG ratio of 0.80. There are some who argue that only stocks with PEG ratios less than one are desirable, but this strategy is equivalent to the strategy of comparing the PE to the expected growth rate.', 'The existence of synergy generally implies that the combined firm will become more profitable or grow at a faster rate after the merger than will the firms operating separately. A test of synergy is to evaluate whether merged firms improve their performance (profitability and growth) relative to their competitors, after takeovers. McKinsey and Co. examined 58 acquisition programs between 1972 and 1983 for evidence on two questions: (1) Did the return on the amount invested in the acquisitions exceed the cost of capital? (2) Did the acquisitions help the parent companies outperform the competition? They concluded that 28 of the 58 programs failed both tests, and six failed at least one test. In a follow-up study of 115 mergers in the U.K. and the U.S. in the 1990s, McKinsey concluded that 60% of the transactions earned returns on capital less than the cost of capital, and that only 23% earned excess returns. 14 In 1999, KPMG examined 700 of the most expensive deals between 1996 and 1998 and concluded that only 17% created value for the combined firm, 30% were value neutral and 53% destroyed value. 15An examination of the eight largest bank mergers in 1995 concluded that only two (Chase/Chemical, First Chicago/NBD) subsequently outperformed the bank-stock index. 16 The largest, Wells Fargo’s acquisition of First Interstate, was a significant failure. In an incisive book on the topic in 1996 titled “The Synergy Trap,” Sirower took a detailed look at the promises and failures of synergy and drew the gloomy conclusion that synergy is often promised but seldom delivered. 17The most damaging piece of evidence on the outcome of acquisitions is the large number of acquisitions that are reversed within fairly short time periods. An analysis!® in 1990 noted that 20.2% of the acquisitions made between 1982 and 1986 were divested by 1988.']\n",

      "['In 1999, KPMG examined 700 of the most expensive deals between 1996 and 1998 and concluded that only 17% created value for the combined firm, 30% were value neutral and 53% destroyed value21.20 This study was referenced in an article titled “Merger Mayhem” that appeared in Barrons on April 20,combined firm to the performance of the relevant industry segment for a year after the deal was completed.A study22 looked at the eight largest bank mergers in 1995 and concluded that only two (Chase/Chemical, First Chicago/NBD) subsequently outperformed the bank-stock index. The largest, Wells Fargo’s acquisition of First Interstate, was a significant failure. In an incisive book on the topic in 1996 titled “The Synergy Trap”, Sirower took a detailed look at the promises and failures of synergy and drew the gloomy conclusion that synergy is often promised but seldom delivered.', 'The existence of synergy generally implies that the combined firm will become more profitable or grow at a faster rate after the merger than will the firms operating separately. A test of synergy is to evaluate whether merged firms improve their performance (profitability and growth) relative to their competitors, after takeovers. McKinsey and Co. examined 58 acquisition programs between 1972 and 1983 for evidence on two questions: (1) Did the return on the amount invested in the acquisitions exceed the cost of capital? (2) Did the acquisitions help the parent companies outperform the competition? They concluded that 28 of the 58 programs failed both tests, and six failed at least one test. In a follow-up study of 115 mergers in the U.K. and the U.S. in the 1990s, McKinsey concluded that 60% of the transactions earned returns on capital less than the cost of capital, and that only 23% earned excess returns. 14 In 1999, KPMG examined 700 of the most expensive deals between 1996 and 1998 and concluded that only 17% created value for the combined firm, 30% were value neutral and 53% destroyed value. 15An examination of the eight largest bank mergers in 1995 concluded that only two (Chase/Chemical, First Chicago/NBD) subsequently outperformed the bank-stock index. 16 The largest, Wells Fargo’s acquisition of First Interstate, was a significant failure. In an incisive book on the topic in 1996 titled “The Synergy Trap,” Sirower took a detailed look at the promises and failures of synergy and drew the gloomy conclusion that synergy is often promised but seldom delivered. 17The most damaging piece of evidence on the outcome of acquisitions is the large number of acquisitions that are reversed within fairly short time periods. An analysis!® in 1990 noted that 20.2% of the acquisitions made between 1982 and 1986 were divested by 1988.', 'This can be seen in the previous example. Dalton Motor, with projected growth in cash flows of 10%, acquires Lube & Auto, which is expected to grow 20%. The fair market value for Lube & Auto is $4,020.91. If Dalton Motor pays more than this amount to acquire Lube & Auto, its stock price will decline, even though the combined firm will grow at a faster rate than Dalton Motor alone. Similarly, Dalton Motor, which sells at a lower multiple of cash flow than Lube & Auto, will increase its value as a multiple of cash flow after the acquisition, but the effect on the stockholders in the firm will still be determined by whether or not the price paid on the acquisition exceeds the fair value.McKinsey and Co. examined 58 acquisition programs between 1972 and 1983 for evidence on two questions: (1) Did the return on the amount invested in the acquisitions32exceed the cost of capital? (2) Did the acquisitions help the parent companies outperform the competition? They concluded that 28 of the 58 programs failed both tests, and six failed at least one test. In a follow-up study7 of 115 mergers in the U.K. and the U.S. in the 1990s, McKinsey concluded that 60% of the transactions earned returns on capital less than the cost of capital and that only 23% earned excess returns.

The largest, Wells Fargo’s acquisition of First Interstate, was a significant failure. Sirower (1996) takes a detailed look at the promises and failures of synergy and draws the gloomy conclusion that synergy is often promised but seldom delivered.', 'It is thus a weak test of the synergy hypothesis.Postmerger StudiesThe existence of synergy generally implies that the combined firm will become more profitable or grow at a faster rate after the merger than would the firms operating separately. A stronger test of synergy is to evaluate whether merged firms improve their performance (profitability and growth) relative to their competitors after takeovers.created value for the combined firm, 30 percent were value neutral, and 53 percent destroyed value. 2123 looked at the eight largest bank mergers in 1995 and concluded that only two (Chase/Chemical, First Chicago/NBD) the outperformed largest, Wells Fargo’s bank-stock index. The Interstate, was a significant acquisition of First failure. Sirower (1996) takes a detailed look at the promises and failures of synergy and draws the gloomy conclusion that synergy is often promised but seldom delivered. 24percent, suggesting that few firms enjoy the promised benefits from acquisitions. In another study, Kaplan and Weisbach (1992) found that 44 percent of the mergers they studied were reversed, largely because the acquirer paid too much or because the operations of the two firms did not mesh. 26Reviewing the evidence, it is clear that markets think that there is potential for synergy at the time of mergers (albeit far less than manager assessments at the same time), but it is also clear that only a small proportion of mergers deliver substantial synergy. Both these findings are consistent with the notion that synergy does exist but that it is far more difficult to generate it in practice than it is on paper.Sharing Synergy GainsIf synergy adds significant value, as it sometimes does, the next question becomes one of sharing these gains. Who should get the benefits of this synergy? In other words, should it be stockholders in the acquiring firm or stockholders in the target firm? In this section, we begin by devising a way of sharing this value fairly between target and acquiring firms. We then look at the evidence on how synergy benefits actually get shared between acquirer and target. We conclude by examining how acquiring firms can improve their odds for getting a larger share of synergy benefits.A Framework for SharingIf synergy can create significant value under the right conditions in an acquisition, the next question becomes one ofdetermining how this incremental value should be shared between the acquiring firm and target firm stockholders.']\n",
      "Wells Fargo's acquisition of First Interstate was considered a failure primarily because it did not outperform the bank-stock index, unlike some of the other major bank mergers in 1995. This failure is in line with the overall trend highlighted in various studies and analyses mentioned in the context, where a significant portion of mergers and acquisitions fail to create value for the combined firm. The book \"The Synergy Trap\" also suggests that the promises of synergy in mergers are often not realized, further indicating that the expected benefits from the acquisition may not have materialized as anticipated. Overall, the evidence presented in the context points towards the lack of successful synergy and value creation as key reasons for the failure of Wells Fargo's acquisition of First Interstate.\n"

The formula for WACC takes into account the cost of equity, cost of debt, and the proportion of each in the company's capital structure. By using WACC, companies can determine the minimum return they need to generate to satisfy their investors and creditors.\n",

      "    answer=\"The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is a financial metric that represents the average cost a company expects to pay to finance its assets. It is a crucial tool in corporate finance as it helps in determining the minimum return that a company must earn on its existing assets to satisfy its creditors, owners, and other providers of capital.\\n\\nWACC is calculated by taking into account the cost of equity, the after-tax cost of debt, and the company's target capital structure. The formula for WACC is:\\n\\nWACC = (E/V) * ke + (D/V) * kd * (1 - Tc)\\n\\nWhere:\\n- E/V is the target level of equity to value using market-based values\\n- D/V is the target level of debt to value using market-based values\\n- ke is the cost of equity\\n- kd is the cost of debt\\n- Tc is the company's marginal tax rate on income\\n\\nThe cost of equity is the return required by equity investors for taking on the risk of investing in the company. It is typically higher than the cost of debt due to the higher risk involved.\\n\\nThe cost of debt is the interest rate a company pays on its debt after accounting for the tax shield provided by deducting interest expenses from taxable income. This cost is lower than the cost of equity but comes with the obligation to make interest payments.\\n\\nThe target capital structure is the mix of debt and equity that a company aims to have in its capital stack. It is important to consider this when calculating WACC as it affects the overall cost of capital.\\n\\nBy calculating WACC, a company can determine the discount rate to use in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to evaluate potential investments or projects.

      "What steps are required for valuation of a technology company? The first step is the right mix of research and development and a project that will be feasible by a few years (in the case of Amgen). The second step is the right mix of research and development and a project that will be feasible by a few years (in the case of Amgen). The third step is the value per share. Since firms that do not have the right mix of research and development and that have the right mix of research and development, the value per share and the capital structure (based on the earnings and book value of capital) can be obtained from these inputs.This mix of research and development allows us to separate the costs associated with developing a technology from the overall cost of capital. Although the two choices are different, the same cost of capital can be written for any technology company that does not have the capacity to generate capital needs and value a large firm over a short period. This can be accomplished by converting operating cash and marketable securities into equity and asset repurchases. Since such cash and marketable securities are not assets that cannot be obtained from financing, the same process can be used to differentiate between option and option.If there is a substantial cash shortfall associated with a firm that is currently valuing, the options in the business that have been valued have to be valued separately. The only viable firm that can do so is a young technology company.The final step in valuation is a more comprehensive discount rate. We begin with an estimate of the cash\n",
      "Valuing a technology company involves several key steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Estimate the value of existing products: This can be done using traditional cash flow models. By estimating the expected cash flows from existing products over their commercial lives and discounting them back to the present at the appropriate cost of capital, we can determine the value of these products.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Value patents using option pricing model: The value of patents held by the technology company can be estimated using an option pricing model. Each patent is valued separately, taking into account the potential future cash flows associated with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Assess research capabilities: The value of a technology company's research capabilities can be a significant component of its overall value. This can be based on perceptions of the firm's ability to generate value from research and development activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider growth potential: Technology companies often have high growth potential due to their technological edge and research prowess. This growth potential needs to be factored into the valuation, either through expected cash flows or by explicitly considering the option component of value.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Gather necessary information: Valuing a technology company using the approaches mentioned above requires access to proprietary information, such as expected variance for option pricing. This information may only be available to insiders of the firm and may need to be estimated for each patent separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps and considering the specific characteristics of technology companies, a more accurate valuation can be obtained.\n"

      "[1] «In chapters 3 and 4, we estimated the minimum acceptable hurdle rates for equity investors (the cost of equity), and for all investors in the firm - (the cost of capital). We defined the cost of capital to be the weighted average of the costs of the different components of financing –– including debt, equity and hybrid securities –– used by a firm to fund its financial requirements. By altering the weights of the different components, firms might be able to change their cost of capital5. In the cost of capital approach, we estimate the costs of debt and equity at different debt ratios, use these costs to compute the costs of capital, and look for the mix of debt and equity that yields the lowest cost of capital for the firm. At this cost of capital, we will argue that firm value is maximized.6.4 Opler, Grinblatt and Titman have an extended discussion of this approach. 5 If capital structure is irrelevant, the cost of capital will be unchanged as the capital structure is altered. 6 If capital structure is irrelevant, the cost of capital will be unchanged as the capital structure is altered.The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is defined as the weighted average of the costs of the different components of financing used by a firm.WACC = ke ( E/ (D+E+PS)) + kd ( D/ (D+E+PS)) + kps ( PS/ (D+E+PS)) where WACC is the weighted average cost of capital, ke, kd and kps are the costs of equity, debt and preferred stock, and E, D and PS are their respective market values.The estimation of the costs of the individual components - equity, debt, and preferred stock, and of the weights in the cost of capital formulation are explored in detail in Chapter 4. To summarize:Cost of Debt = Pre-tax Interest Rate on Borrowing (1 - tax rate)Cost of Preferred Stock = Preferred Dividend / Preferred Stock Price»\n",
      "[2] «In the cost of capital approach, the effects of leverage show up in the cost of capital, with the tax benefit incorporated in the after-tax cost of debt and the bankruptcy costs in both the levered beta and the pre-tax cost of debt. Will the two approaches yield the same value? Not necessarily. The first reason for the differences is that the models consider bankruptcy costs very differently, with the adjusted present value approach providing more flexibility in allowing you to consider indirect bankruptcy costs. To the extent that these costs do not show up or show up inadequately in the pre-tax cost of debt, the APV approach will yield a more conservative estimate of value. The second reason is that the APV approach considers the tax benefit from a dollar debt value, usually based upon existing debt. The cost of capital approach estimates the tax benefit from a debt ratio that may require the firm to borrow increasing amounts in the future. For instance, assuming a market debt to capital ratio of 30% in perpetuity for a growing firm will require it to borrow more in the future and the tax benefit from expected future borrowings isincorporated into value today.There are many who believe that adjusted present value is a more flexible way of approaching valuation than traditional discounted cash flow models. This may be true in a generic sense, but APV valuation in practice has significant flaws. The first and most important is that most practitioners who use the adjusted present value model ignoreexpected bankruptcy costs. Adding the tax benefits to unlevered firm value to get to the levered firm value makes debt seem like an unmixed blessing. Firm value will be overstated, especially at very high debt ratios, where the cost of bankruptcy is clearly not zero and, in some instances, the cost of bankruptcy is higher than the tax benefit of debt.Both the cost of capital approach and the APV approach make the value of a firm a function of its leverage. It follows directly, then, that there is some mix of debt and equity at which firm value is maximized. In the rest of this chapter, we consider how best to make this link.In order to understand the relationship between the cost of capital and optimal capital structure, we rely on the relationship between firm value and the cost of capital. In the earlier section, we noted that the value of the entire firm can be estimated by discounting the expected cash flows to the firm at the firm’s cost of capital. The cash flows to the firm can be estimated as cash flows after operating expenses, taxes and any capital investments needed to create future growth in both fixed assets and working capital, but before financing expenses.Cash Flow to Firm = EBIT (1-t) - (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation) - Change in Working CapitalThe value of the firm can then be written as:and is a function of the firm’s cash flows and its cost of capital. If we assume that the cash flows to the firm are unaffected by the choice of financing mix and the cost of capital is reduced as a consequence of changing the financing mix, the value of the firm will increase. If the objective in choosing the financing mix for the firm is the maximization of firm value, we can accomplish it, in this case, by minimizing the cost of capital. In themore general case where the cash flows to the firm are a function of the debt-equity mix, the optimal financing mix is the mix that maximizes firm value.10Illustration 15.6: WACC, Firm Value, and LeverageAssume that you are given the costs of equity and debt at different debt levels for Strunks Inc., a leading manufacturer of chocolates and other candies, and that the cash flows to this firm are currently $200 million. Strunks is in a relatively stable market. The cash flows are expected to grow at 6% forever and are unaffected by the debt ratio of the firm. The cost of capital schedule is provided in Table 15.9, along with the value of the firm at each level of debt.Note that the value of the firm = = ( + g1 g- Cash flows to firm of Capital ( ) 06.1 Capital - Cost 200 of Cost 0.0610 In other words, the value of the firm might not be maximized at the point that cost of capital is minimized, if firm cash flows are much lower at that level.The value of the firm increases as the cost of capital decreases, and decreases as the cost of capital increases. This is illustrated in Figure 15.2.bankruptcy costs that affect revenues and operating income.Steps in Cost of Capital ApproachWe need three basic inputs to compute the cost of capital – the cost of equity, the after-tax cost of debt and the weights on debt and equity.»\n",
      "[3] «Once you have estimated the costs of debt and equity, you estimate the weights for each, based on market values (rather than book value). For publicly traded firms, multi- plying the share price by the number of shares outstanding will yield market value of equity. Estimating the market value of debt is usually a more difficult exercise, since most firms have some debt that is not traded and many practitioners fall back on using book value of debt. Using 3M again as our illustrative example, the market values of equity ($57 billion) and debt ($5.3 billion), and our earlier estimates of cost of equity (9.16 percent) and after-tax cost of debt (2.91 percent), result in a cost of capital for the firm of 8.63 percent.Cost of capital = 9.16% (57/(57+5.3)) + 2.91% (5.3/(57+5.3)) = 8.63%When valuing firms, we have a follow up judgment to make in terms of whether these weights will change or remain stable. If we assume that they will change, we haveto specify both what the target mix for the firm will be and how soon the change will occur.»\n",
      "[4] «In computing weights for debt, equity, and preferred stock, we have two choices. We can take the accounting estimates of the value of each funding source from the balance sheet and compute book value weights. Alternatively, we can use or estimate market values for each component and compute weights based on relative market value. As a general rule, the weights used in the cost of capital computation should be based on market values. This is because the cost of capital is a forward-looking measure and captures the cost of raising new funds to buy the firm today. Since new debt and equity have to be raised in the market at prevailing prices, the market value weights is more relevant.There are some analysts who continue to use book value weights and justify them using three arguments, none of which are convincing:1. Book value is more reliable than market value because it is not as volatile. While it is true that book value does not change as much as market value, this is more a reflection of weakness than strength, since the true value of the firm changes over time as new information comes out about the firm and the overall economy. We would argue that market value, with its volatility, is a much better reflection of true value than is book value. 512. Using book value rather than market value is a more conservative approach to estimating debt ratios. The book value of equity in most firms in developed markets is well below the value attached by the market, whereas the book value of debt is usually close to the market value of debt. Since the cost of equity is much higher than the cost of debt, the cost of capital calculated using book value ratios will be lower than those calculated using market value ratios, making them less conservative estimates, not more so. 523. Since accounting returns are computed based on book value, consistency requires the use of book value in computing cost of capital. While it may seem consistent to use book values for both accounting return and cost of capital calculations, it does not make economic sense. The funds invested in this firm can be invested elsewhere, earning market rates, and the costs should therefore be computed at market rates and using market value weights.Analysts are often faced with a difficult question of what to include in debt, given that debt can be short-term or long-term, secured or unsecured, and floating or fixed rate. In addition, we have to decide on what other liabilities we want to include in the debt component. While the temptation often is to be conservative and include all potential liabilities as debt, this can prove counterproductive since increasing the debt will often reduce the cost of capital (and increase firm value). In general, we would recommend including the following items in debt:All Interest-Bearing Liabilitiesmultiple Most borrowings—short-term and long-term bonds and bank debt with different terms and interest rates. While there are some analysts who create separate categories for each type of debt and attach a different cost to each category, this approach is both tedious and dangerous. Using it, we can conclude that short-term debt is cheaper than long-term debt and that secured debt is cheaper than unsecured debt, even though neither of these conclusions is justified. The solution is simple. Combine all debt—short- and long-term, bank debt and bonds—and attach the long-term cost of debt to it. In other words, add the default spread to the long-term risk-free rate and use that rate as the pretax cost of debt. Firms will undoubtedly complain, arguing that their effective cost of debt can be lowered by using short-term debt. This is technically true, largely because short-term rates tend to be lower than long-term rates with upward-sloping yield curves, but it misses the point of computing the cost of debt andcapital. If this is the hurdle rate we want our long-term investments to beat, we want the rate to reflect the cost of long-term borrowing and not short-term borrowing. After all, a firm that funds long-term projects with short-term debt will have to return to the market to roll over this debt.All Lease Commitments»\n",
      "[5] «The cost of capital approach can be used to find the optimal capital structure for a firm, as we will for Disney in March 2004. Disney had $13,100 million in debt on its books. The estimated market value of this debt was $12,915 million was added the present value of operating leases, of $1,753 million to arrive at a total market value for the debt of $14,668 million. 8 The market value of equity at the same time was $55,101 million; the market price per share was $ 22.26, and there were 2475.093 million shares outstanding. Proportionally, 21.02% of the overall financing mix was debt, and the remaining 78.98% was equity.The beta for Disney's stock in March 2004, as estimated in chapter 7, was 1.2456. The treasury bond rate at that time was 4%. Using an estimated market risk premium of 4.82%, we estimated the cost of equity for disney to be 10.00%:Cost of Equity = Riskfree rate + Beta * (Market Premium)=4.00% + 1.2456 (4.82%) = 10.00%8 The details of this calculation are in illustration 4.15 in chapter 4.Disney’s senior debt was rated BBB+. Based upon this rating, the estimated pre-tax cost of debt for Disney is 5.25%. The tax rate used for the analysis is 37.30%.Value of Firm = 14,668+ 55,101 = $ 69,769 millionAfter-tax Cost of debt = Pre-tax interest rate (1- tax rate)= 5.25% (1- 0.373) = 3.29%The cost of capital was calculated using these costs and the weights based upon market value: WACC = Cost of Equity (Equity/(Equity + Debt)) + After-tax Cost of Debt (Debt/(Debt +Equity))= 10.00%* [55,101/69.769] + 3.58% *[14,668/69,769] = 8.59%Disney had a book value of equity of approximately $ 16.5 billion. Using the book value of debt of $ 13.1 billion, estimate the cost of capital for Disney using book value weights.I. Disney's Cost of Equity and LeverageThe cost of equity for Disney at different debt ratios can be computed using the unlevered beta of the firm, and the debt equity ratio at each level of debt. We use the levered betas that emerge to estimate the cost of equity. The first step in this process is to compute the firm’s current unlevered beta, using the current market debt to equity ratio and a tax rate of 37.30%.Unlevered Beta = Current Beta / (1 + (1-t) Debt/Equity)= 1.0674Note that this is the bottom-up unlevered beta that we estimated for Disney in chapter 4, based upon its business mix. We continued to use the treasury bond rate of 4% and the market premium of 4.82% to compute the cost of equity at each level of debt. If we keep the tax rate constant at 37.30%, we obtain the levered betas for Disney in table 8.2.The beta of debt is based upon the rating of the bond and is estimated by regressing past returns on bonds in each rating class against returns on a market index. The levered betas estimated using this approach will generally be lower than those estimated with the conventional model.9II. Disney's Cost of Debt and LeverageSeveral financial ratios are correlated with bond ratings and, ideally, we could build a sophisticated model to predict ratings. For purposes of this illustration, however, we use a much simpler version: We assume that bond ratings are determined solely by the interest coverage ratio, which is defined as:Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before interest & taxes / Interest Expense We chose the interest coverage ratio for three reasons. First, it is a ratio10 used by both Standard and Poor's and Moody's to determine ratings. Second, there is significant correlation not only between the interest coverage ratio and bond ratings, but also between the interest coverage ratio and other ratios used in analysis, such as the debt coverage ratio and the funds flow ratios. Third, the interest coverage ratio changes as a firm changes is financing mix and decreases as the debt ratio increases. The ratings9 Consider, for instance, a debt ratio of 40%. At this level the firm’s debt will take on some of the characteristics of equity Assume that the beta of debt at a 0% debt ratio is 0.40.»\n",

      "[2] «is an eccentric and he does things his way now one of the things I've learned about Tesla as I've gone along also is it's a story stock what does that mean the value that you attach to Tes Tesla is not just a function of the numbers you see for the company but the story you tell about where the company is going in fact in 2016 I wrote a post on Tesla where I talked about the different stories you could tell about the company starting with what does it do is an automobile company a technology company an energy company is it focused on the highend customer base or the mass Market is it compet Competitive Edge that it's a first company out there is it the style and the brand is it the tech technology what is its intensity does it invest like a manufacturing company does it invest like a technology company and what is it risk come from does it is the risk that of an automobile company the risk that of an technology company those choices will drive the inputs into your valuation into growth and margins and reinvestment risk and ultimately play out value in fact in that 2016 post I showed how different stories about Tesla could play out as very different estimates of value now the values themselves right now are not relevant because this was 2016 but the point I was trying to make is when people disagree about what Tesla is worth they're not disagreeing about a growth rate they're disagreeing about the fundamental story about the company that hasn't changed now if you've been a Tesla investor or even an observer of Tesla along the way Tesla sometimes does things that make you look and say what why would they do that I remember in 2017 when Tesla chose to borrow money you're saying what's wrong companies borrow money all the time chose Tesla chose to borrow money in 2017 when it was a money losing company and Equity markets loved it they had a choice of using Equity they chose not to do it Tesla also if you remember often sets targets for itself that you that you look at and say why would you do that now let me take that back it's not Tesla that often sets a targets it's Elon Musk I remember Elon Musk setting a Target that Tesla would meet 5,000 cars a week completely arbitrary and then Tesla twisting itself into a pretzel trying to deliver 5,000 cars a week now sometimes the the the the damage was self-inflicted you know when Elon Musk»\n",
      "[3] «going to start I'm going to break Tesla down into businesses and look at each business separately because each business is very different operating characteristics now before I do that I'll I want to talk a little bit about how the new stories that have come out during the course of the year will play out in those businesses I'm going to break Tesla into four businesses the automobile business and obviously you know what that includes electric cars the Cyber truck if it makes it the second business I'm going to look at is the energy business which has been there since you know especially since 2016 but it's been a small business but the way it grew in 2023 I think it deserves to be taken seriously as a standalone business the third business I want to I'm going to look at is software know coming from the fact that Tes lab for better is pushing full self driving as software that people can either buy perhaps a subscription model and the fourth is Robo taxis and whether this Advan the advances that Tesla's made again I know there's debate about it can translate into a large and profitable Robo taxi business now I'll take each of the three news stories I talked about and talk about how they might affect my story lines I'm going to start with the easiest one the Cyber trucks now clearly there is um there's a lot of excitement about cyber trucks at least among the subset of the population in fact Tesla a tracker on its website where you can track reservations people have made now take this with a grain of salt because a lot of people who make reservations don't carry through and actually buy the truck but I think at last count when I looked at the tracker there were almost 2 million people on who were interested in buying the Cyber truck now even if only one tenth of those people actually buy that's a pretty hefty increase in sales from cyber trucks alone now just as a note of caution so well the plus is the Cyber truck will be expansion into a segment of the market where Tesla has not had a presence a truck Market there are downsides in this in in in in this new in this new product and Elon Musk in the most recent earnings call was actually surprisingly down on the Cyber truck in terms of value perhaps you know it was just the day and the mood that he was in but he did talk about you know the potential downside and I can see at»\n",
      "[4] «that you know Tesla is no nowhere as as far as it claims to be on and that it's it's dangerous to push this to the Forefront no matter what though Tesla is the only automobile company that seems to have made FSD part of its long-term story that's actually thinking about bringing it into its business model in fact um know Tesla has offered a beta version of FSD to its drivers for $122,000 I think it's the latest price that's a pretty hefty price to pay but Tesla clearly is thinking about making this part of its Revenue model and its business model so that's the second big story and we'll talk about how how that plays out in the value of Tesla and third of course is a cyber truck now now as many of you know I'm not a big automobile fan I own a 2010 Honda Civic I barely drive and to me you know waiting for a car seems like something I shouldn't be waiting for but they're clearly people who love their their Automobiles and the Cyber truck clearly has got lots of attention first because of its novelty the way it's design designed and second because it represents Tesla's entree into a market the truck Market that it's hither to stayed away from and that's a market where the the Legacy automakers still have a very sizable presence so You' got price Cuts you got full self-driving and cyber trucks and the question is how does this play out in the numbers and the value for Tesla I do think though it's time for a reset that what we've learned about Tesla since the start of 2023 is U has to be built into value and the question is is how best to do it now I so far when I value Tesla and all of my valuations I value Tesla as a single business company is primarily an automobile company so I haven't broken Tesla down into businesses and I've been taken to task for this that said though it doesn't mean I haven't Incorporated the other businesses into my valuations in my January 2023 valuation the revenues that I give Tesla include revenues from Robo taxes and from software or other businesses and my margins that I gave to for Tesla 16% margin are well above automobile margins and reflected the higher margins of these new businesses so I've buried the other businesses in my inputs but I do think given what we've seen in Tesla in 2023 that it's time for me to break these businesses up and deal with them individually so so that's where I'm»\n",
      "[5] «hi welcome back when I teach my classes on valuation I start by describing valuation as a craft not an art not a science but a craft and the essence of a craft is you learn by doing and there is no company where I've practiced the valuation craft more than Tesla it's a company where I've learned more about valuation then I have about the company now along the ways I valued Tesla multiple times over the last decade I've got it hopelessly wrong sometimes and I'm sure some of you will stop right now and say why should I listen to this guy get it wrong again okay my first valuation of Tesla was in 2013 at that time I valued Tesla as a luxury automobile company as a successful luxury automobile company in fact while it had very little revenues was losing large amounts at that time I predicted that 10 years out which would make it 2023 revenues of 65 billion and an operating margin of 122% you're welcome to compare later on in this session to what the actual numbers came in at but the value for the equity that I got was less than 10 billion for the company part of the reason the equity value was depressed was because I estimated large amounts of reinvestment that Tesla would need to make to get to that revenue of $65 billion now as I value Tesla each time I've done it I've learned a little bit more about the company if I were to summarize the three big lessons I've learned about the company here are the three three lessons the first is Tesla's reinvented how manufacturing is done in the automobile business what does that mean the oldtime automobile companies built huge and inflexible assembly lines Capital intensive and then use them to churn out more and more cars Tesla has been able to grow with a vastly less reinvestment than the typical automobile company second the Tesla customer base is loyal to a fault not only are they loyal in terms of being loyal to the brand they're evangelists they're the they they seek Out friends and try them to buy Teslas as well in fact Tesla's biggest Salesforce its own customers and third Tesla is a CEO that I'm going to describe as unique and I'm not and unique not in a bad way in a world full of CEOs who lack vision and in fact are walking examples of the Peter Principle remember the Peter Principle is you li rise to the level of your incompetence Elon mus stands out he has enough Vision to power a 100 CEOs but he»\n",
      "Question: I am planning to invest in Tesla, an EV company. What things should I keep in mind?\n",
      "Answer:\u001b[32m When investing in Tesla, there are several key factors to keep in mind. Firstly, Tesla is not just an automobile company but also a technology and energy company, so it's important to consider its diversification into different sectors. Secondly, Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, is known for his unique approach and vision, which has been a driving force behind the company's success. It's important to consider how his leadership may impact the company's future growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Tesla's focus on innovation, particularly in the electric vehicle and autonomous driving sectors, should be taken into account. The company's advancements in Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and potential for a Robo taxi business could be significant drivers of future growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Tesla's financial performance, including its margins, returns on capital, and revenue growth in different business segments, should be closely monitored. Understanding the company's financial health and profitability is crucial for making informed investment decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, it's important to keep in mind that Tesla is a \"story stock,\" meaning that the value of the company is not solely based on traditional financial metrics but also on the narrative and future potential of the company. Considering all these factors will help you make a well-informed decision when investing in Tesla.\u001b[0m\n",
