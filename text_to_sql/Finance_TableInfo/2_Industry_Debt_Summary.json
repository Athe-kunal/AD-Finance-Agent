{"table_name": "Industry_Debt_Summary", "table_summary": "Summary of debt-related data for different industries including lease debt, conventional debt, total debt with leases, interest expense, book interest rate, and more.End Game - Details of debt held by firms (lease vs conventional, ST vs LT)Number of firms - Number of firms in the indusry grouping. - Law of large numbers?,Lease Debt (my estimate) - Aggregated value of present value of lease commitments reported in financial statements, using the pre-tax cost of debt (my estimate) as the discount rate. (Lease commitments beyond year 5 converted into annual lease payments for extended period). - Lease commitments are debt, and the conversion to debt should be at the pre-tax cost of debt.,Conventional Debt - Aggregated value of all interest bearing debt, reported on balance sheet, including short term borrowings and long term borrowings. - Consistent with defintiion of what should go into debt in a company's cost of capital.,Total Debt with leases - Sum of lease debt (my estimate) and conventional debt. - Total debt used in computing cost of capital.,Interest Expense - Aggregated value of interest expenses of all firms in industry group, as reported in income statements.  - This is the interest expense from interest-bearning (conventional) debt.,Book Interest rate - Aggregated value of interest expenses/ Aggregated value of conventional (interest-bearing) debt. - This should not be used in the cost of capital calculations, as pre-tax cost of debt, but a comparison to the estimated pre-tax cost of debt (based upon default risk) can help estimate whether the market value of debt is higher or lower than book value.,Short term Debt as % of Total Debt - Aggregated Short term (<1 year) debt as percent of aggregated conventional (interest-bearning) debt. - Measures usage of short term debt in financing, for good (matching asset duration) or bad (trying to plat yield curve) reasons.,Lease Debt (Accounting) - Starting in 2019, IFRS and GAAP are requiring that lease commitments be reported as debt. Since the accounting rules for what should be counted as lease commitments and the discount rate used to get present value are different from mine, this number can be different from my estimate. - Check on whether accounting lease debt rules are being consistently applied and whether there are loopholes that companies are using to evade these rules."}
