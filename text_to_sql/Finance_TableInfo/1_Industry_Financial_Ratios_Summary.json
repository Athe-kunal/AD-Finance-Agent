{"table_name": "Industry_Financial_Ratios_Summary", "table_summary": "Summary of financial ratios for different industries including beta, D/E ratio, effective tax rate, unlevered beta, cash/firm value, HiLo risk, standard deviations, and average values from 2020 to 2023.End Game - To estimate pure play betas by business, to use in estimating a bottom up beta for a project or a company. Number of firms - Number of firms in the indusry grouping. - Law of large numbers?,Beta - Simple average across firms of each firm's  beta, taken as a weighted average of 2-year and 5-year weekly return regression betas, with 2-year betas weighted 2/3rds. If the company has only a 2-year beta, it is used. - I average the 2-year and 5-year betas, to remove some noise at the company level, and then take the simple average to remove even more. I don't use weighted averages, since that will make each sector's beta converge on its largest company or companies.,D/E Ratio - Total debt, including lease debt/ Market Value of equity. I aggregate each number across the firms and then compute the aggregate debt to equity ratio. - My definition of debt for all things cost of capital. I have always treated lease commitments as debt. Now the accountants will as well.,Effective Tax Rate - Effective tax rate in the most recxent 12 months. - I need a tax rate.,Unlevered Beta - Beta/ (1+ (1-tax rate) (D/E)). You can use either a marginal or effective tax rate as your option.  - Interest saves you taxes at the margin. You should generally use a marginal tax rate, but if you have a multinational facing different marginal tax rates in different regions, you may use effective instead,,Cash/Firm Value - Cash & Marketable Securities/ (Market Value of Equity + Total Debt, including lease debt. Aggregated across companies first ans then computed. - Cash is usualy invested in liquid, close to riskless investments and has a beta close to zero. ,Unlevered Beta corrected for cash - Unlevered Beta/ (1- Cash/Firm Vaue). Cash has a beta of zero. With this calculation, I remove its effect to get a pure play beta. - The standard unlevered beta is an unlevered beta for the company. If the company holds a large amount of cash, you need to remove it from the calculation to get a beta for just the business.,HiLo Risk - Simple average of (High Price for year - Low Price/ (High Price + Low Price). It is a non-parametric and simple measure of price risk. - If you don't like making distributional assumptions and want a simple range-based measure of risk\u2026,Standard deviation (equity) - Simple average across firms of each firm's standard deviation in stock prices in the prior 2 years, using weekly returns. - This is the total risk. Beta measures only the portion of this standard deviation that is market-related.,Standard deviation (operating income) - Simple average across firms of each firm's coefficient of variation in annual operating income over prior 10 years. (Coefficient of variation is standard deviation divided by average operating income over the period) - If you don't like price-based measures of risk, preferring something more intrinsic, this may be your preferred measure of risk. (Since operating income levels vary widely across firms, I used the coefficient of variation.)"}
