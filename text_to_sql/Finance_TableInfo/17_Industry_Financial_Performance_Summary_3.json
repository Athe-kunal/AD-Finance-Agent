{"table_name": "Industry_Financial_Performance_Summary_3", "table_summary": "Summary of financial performance metrics for different industries including number of firms, percentage of money losing firms, PE ratios, market cap to net income ratios, expected growth, and PEG ratio.End Game - To estimate ratios of market value of equity to equity earnings (PE), in all its different forms.Number of firms - Number of firms in the industry grouping. - Law of large numbers?,% of Money-losing firms - Percent of firms in group with negative trailing earnings (and PE ratios that are not meaningful) - These money-losing firms are lost when you average out PE ratios across the group, and that will create a bias in the average (since money-losing firms tend to be smaller, riskier and perhaps have higher growth),Current PE - Price per share divided by EPS in most recent fiscal year, averaged across all money-making firms in the group. - Simple average of PE ratios, based upon current earnings, across only money making firms. Will be biased by non-money making firms and by equal averaging,,Trailing PE - Price per share divided by EPS in trailing twelve months, averaged across all money-making firms in the group. - Simple average of PE ratios, based upon trailing earnings, across only money making firms. Will be biased by non-money making firms and by equal averaging,,Forward PE - Price per share divided by expected EPS in next foru quarters, averaged across all money-making firms in the group. - Simple average of PE ratios, based upon forward earnings, across only money making firms. Will be biased by non-money making firms and by equal averaging,,Aggregate Mkt Cap/ Net Income (all firms) - Aggregate market capitalization of equity divided by aggregated net income, across all companies in group. - Includes all firms in group, and is closer to a weighted average, with larger firms weighted more than smaller ones. (Money losers will push the ratio upwards),Aggregate Mkt Cap/ Trailing Net Income (only money making firms) - Aggregate market capitalization of equity divided by aggregated net income, across only money-making companies in group. - Same as above, but without the upward bias created by including money losers.,Expected growth - next 5 years - Average expected growth rate in earnings per share for next five years, across all firms in the group, with this statistic available. - Higher growth usually accompanies higher PE ratios,PEG Ratio - Current PE (from column 3) divided by expected growth rate in earnings per share for next five years, - A growth-adjusted version of PE that some investors use to compare pricing of companies with different growth rates."}
