{"table_name": "Industry_Standard_Deviation_and_Ratios", "table_summary": "Summary of standard deviation in equity and firm value, along with E/(D+E) and D/(D+E) ratios for different industries.End Game - To estimate annualized standard deviation in equity and firm valuesNumber of firms - Number of firms in the industry grouping. - Law of large numbers?,Std Deviation in Equity - Average of annualized standard deviation in stock prices, across companies in group. - Measure of (annualized) standard deviation in equity. The standard deviation of each company's stock prices comes from weekly stock prices in prior two years.,Std Deviation in Firm Value - Average of annualized standard deviation in firm value, across companies in group. - Measure of (annualized) standard deviation in operating assets (firm). This is computed by taking into assuming that the standard deviation in debt is 40% of the standard deviation in equity (based upon public market estimates) and that debt and equity values have a correlation of equity. Varianc ein firm value = Std deviation in equity ^2 *(E/(D+E))^2 + Std deviation in debt ^2 *(D/(D+E))^2 + 2 * Correlation between debt and equity * Std Deviation of equity * Std deviation in debt. (This is the standard equation for variance in a two-asset portfolio.),E/(D+E) - Aggregate market capitalization divided by aggregate firm value (market cap + total debt), across companies in group. - Market value of equity, as percent of total market value of firm,E/(D+E) - Aggregate total debt divided by aggregate firm value (market cap + total debt), across companies in group. - Total debt, as percent of total market value of firm"}
