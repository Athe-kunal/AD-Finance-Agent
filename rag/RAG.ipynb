       "'If the objective function in corporate finance is to maximize firm value, it follows that firm value must be linked to the three corporate finance decisions outlined above - investment, financing, and dividend decisions.\\nThe link between these decisions and firm value can be made by recognizing that the value of a firm is the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted back at a rate that reflects both the riskiness of the projects of the firm and the financing mix used to finance them.\\nInvestors form expectations about future cash flows based upon observed current cash flows and expected future growth, which, in turn, depends upon the quality of the firm’s projects (its investment decisions) and the amount reinvested back into the business (its dividend decisions).\\nThe financing decisions affect the value of a firm through both the discount rate and, potentially, through the expected cash flows.This neat formulation of value is put to the test by the interactions among the investment, financing, and dividend decisions, and the conflicts of interest that arise between stockholders and lenders to the firm, on the one hand, and stockholders and managers, on the other.\\nWe introduce the basic models available to value a firm and its equity in chapter 12, and relate them back to management decisions on investment, financial and dividend policy.\\nIn the process, we examine the determinants of value and how firms can increase their value.The proliferation of news and information on real world businesses making decisions every day suggests that we do not need to use hypothetical businesses to illustrate the principles of corporate finance.\\nWe will use four businesses through this book to make our points about corporate financial policy:In order to make the learning in this book as interactive and current as possible, we will employ a variety of devices:preceded by the symbolThese data sets will be preceded by the symbolThere are several fundamental arguments we will make repeatedly throughout this1.\\nCorporate finance has an internal consistency that flows from its choice of maximizing firm value as the only objective function and its dependence upon a few bedrock principles: risk has to be rewarded; cash flows matter more than accounting income; markets are not easily fooled; every decision a firm makes has an effect on its value.\\n2.\\nCorporate finance must be viewed as an integrated whole, rather than as a collection of decisions.\\nInvestment decisions generally affect financing decisions, and vice versa; financing decisions generally affect dividend decisions, and vice versa.\\nWhile there arecircumstances under which these decisions may be independent of each other, this is seldom the case in practice.\\nAccordingly, it is unlikely that firms that deal with their problems on a piecemeal basis will ever resolve these problems.\\nFor instance, a firm that takes poor investments may soon find itself with a dividend problem (with insufficient funds to pay dividends) and a financing problem (because the drop in earnings may make it difficult for them to meet interest expenses).3.\\nCorporate finance matters to everybody.\\nThere is a corporate financial aspect to almost every decision made by a business; while not everyone will find a use for all the components of corporate finance, everyone will find a use for at least some part of it.\\nMarketing managers, corporate strategists human resource managers and information technology managers all make corporate finance decisions every day and often don’t realize it.\\nAn understanding of corporate finance may help them make better decisions.\\n4.\\nCorporate finance is fun.\\nThis may seem to be the tallest claim of all.\\nAfter all, most people associate corporate finance with numbers, accounting statements and hardheaded analyses.\\nWhile corporate finance is quantitative in its focus, there is a significant component of creative thinking involved in coming up with solutions to the financial problems businesses do encounter.\\nIt is no coincidence that financial markets remain thebreeding grounds for innovation and change.5.\\nThe best way to learn corporate finance is by applying its models and theories to real world problems.\\nWhile the theory that has been developed over the last few decades is impressive, the ultimate test of any theory is in applications.\\nAs we show in this book, much, if not all, of the theory can be applied to real companies and not just to abstract examples, though we have to compromise and make assumptions in the process.This chapter establishes the first principles that govern corporate finance.\\nThe investment principle, that specifies that businesses invest only in projects that yield a return that exceeds the hurdle rate, the financing principle, that suggests that the right financing mix for a firm is one that maximizes the value of the investments made and the dividend principle, which requires that cash generated in excess of “good project” needs be returned to the owners, are the core for what follows.“If you do not know where you are going, it does not matter how you get there”Corporate finance’s greatest strength and its greatest weaknesses is its focus on value maximization.\\nBy maintaining that focus, corporate finance preserves internal consistency and coherence, and develops powerful models and theory about the “right” way to make investment, financing and dividend decisions.\\nIt can be argued, however, that all of these conclusions are conditional on the acceptance of value maximization as the only objective in decision-making.In this chapter, we consider why we focus so strongly on value maximization and why, in practice, the focus shifts to stock price maximization.\\nWe also look at the assumptions needed for stock price maximization to be the right objective, the things that can go wrong with firms that focus on it and at least partial fixes to some of these problems.\\nWe will argue strongly that, even though stock price maximization is a flawed objective, it offers far more promise than alternative objectives because it is self- correcting.\\n\\n'"

       "\"Let us start with a description of what an objective is, and the purpose it serves in developing theory.\\nAn objective specifies what a decision maker is trying to accomplish and by so doing, provides measures that can be used to choose between alternatives.\\nIn most firms, it is the managers of the firm, rather than the owners, who make the decisions about where to invest or how to raise funds for an investment.\\nThus, if stock price maximization is the objective, a manager choosing between two alternatives will choose the one that increases stock price more.\\nIn most cases, the objective is stated in terms of maximizing some function or variable, such as profits or growth, or minimizing some function or variable, such as risk or costs.So why do we need an objective, and if we do need one, why cannot we have several? Let us start with the first question.\\nIf an objective is not chosen, there is nosystematic way to make the decisions that every business will be confronted with at some point in time.\\nFor instance, without an objective, how can Disney's managers decide whether the investment in a new theme park is a good one? There would be a menu of approaches for picking projects, ranging from reasonable ones like maximizing return on investment to obscure ones like maximizing the size of the firm, and no statements could be made about their relative value.\\nConsequently, three managers looking at the same project may come to three separate conclusions about it.\\n\\n\""
