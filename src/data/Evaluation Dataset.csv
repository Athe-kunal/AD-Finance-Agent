For equity to be viewed as a call option, equity investors have to be running the firm, have a residual claim on the assets in liquidation and have limited liability",
SESSION 13C,Q1,"Publicly traded companies often accumulate cash that is usually invested in riskless, liquid securities that yield low returns. Which of the following is a good reason for punishing companies that hold cash (by discounting the cash)?a. The cash earns a lower rate of return than the cost of equity b.

The company has a bad track record on operating investments and you are afraid that the company will invest the cash","d. The company has a bad track record on operating investments and you are afraid that the company will invest the cash. Cash earns a low rate of return, but it is a fair rate of return. So, it is neither a value destroyer not does it create value. It is your concern that it may be “wasted” by investing a project/business where you earn less than the cost of capital that triggers the discount..",
SESSION 13C,Q2,"Genesis is a closed end mutual fund, with $250 million invested in publicly traded securities (net asset value). The fund is an average risk fund (beta = 1) and has earned an annual return of 9% over the last 5 years; the market return over the period was 12%. If you expect the market return in the future to be 8% and Genesis to continue under performing the market by the same amount as it has for the last 5 years, estimate the discount that the fund will trade at (assuming no growth in the fund, in perpetuity).",Market value of fund = 5/.08 = $62.5 • Discount as % = 1-‐ 62.5/100 = .375 or 37.5%,

SESSION3,Q2,"In valuation, your risk free has to be a long term, default-‐free rate. When valuing a company in US dollars, we often use the 10-‐year US T. bond rate as the risk free rate. In the last few years, there have been questions about whether the US treasury is really default-‐free. If you share these concerns, which of the following will you do, assuming that you are still estimating cash flows in US dollars?2. In valuation, your risk free has to be a long term, default-‐free rate. When valuing a company in US dollars, we often use the 10-‐year US T. bond rate as the risk free rate. In the last few years, there have been questions about whether the US treasury is really default-‐free. If you share these concerns, which of the following will you do, assuming that you are still estimating cash flows in US dollars?a. Continue to use it the 10-‐year bond rate the risk free rate since you have no choiceb. Switch to using the US treasury bill rate, since default is less likely in the short termc. Estimate a default spread for the US government and reduce the treasury bond rate by that spreadd. Use the rate on a 10-‐year Swiss Government bond, denominated in Swiss francs (since the Swiss government has no default risk)e. None of the above",c. Estimate a default spread for the US government and reduce the T. bond rate by that spread. You could obtain the spread for the US sovereign CDS and net it out from the US treasury bond rate. You cannot use as short term rate or a rate from a bond denominated in a different currency.,
SESSION3,Q3,"You are valuing a Spanish company in Euros. Which of the following would you use as your risk free rate in your valuation?a. The rate on Spanish government ten-‐year euro bond (5%) b.

SESSION3,Q4, You are valuing a Peruvian company in US dollars. The Peruvian government has a CDS (Credit Default Swap) that is trading at 1%. Which riskfree rate would you use in your valuation?a. The rate on a Peruvian 10-‐year Sol denominated bond (6%) b. The rate on a Peruvian 10-‐year US $ denominated bond (3.5%) c. The rate on a Peruvian 10-‐year Sol denominated bond minus CDS spread d. The rate on a 10-‐year US treasury bond (2%)e. None of the above,"d. The rate on a US T.Bond. If the valuation is done in dollars, the Sol rate is not the right riskfree rate. The Peruvian dollar bond rate has default risk in it (it is trading at a higher rate than the T.Bond)",
SESSION3,Q5,What would you use as your risk free rate if you were valuing a Peruvian company in Peruvian Sol? (You can still assume that the Peruvian sovereign CDS is trading at 1%.) a. The rate on a Peruvian 10-‐year Sol denominated bond (6%) b. The rate on a Peruvian 10-‐year US $ denominated bond (3.5%) c. The rate on a Peruvian 10-‐year Sol denominated bond minus thed. The rate on a 10-‐year US treasury bond (2%) e. None of the above,"c. The rate on the Peruvian Sol bond, net of the CDS spread (6%-‐1% = 5%). There is a small mismatching problem since the CDS spread is in US$ terms, but there is no easy way to get the default spread in Sol.",
SESSION5,Q1,"The implied equity risk premium is a forward-‐looking premium, estimated from the level of stock prices (the index) today and expected earnings/cash flows in the future. Assume that you compute the implied ERP at the start of a year and the market goes up 20% during the course of the year and that you compute the implied ERP again at the end of the year. Assuming that the risk free rate and growth rate do not change over the course of the year, which of the following would you expect to happen to the implied ERP?1. The implied equity risk premium is a forward-‐looking premium, estimated from the level of stock prices (the index) today and expected earnings/cash flows in the future. Assume that you compute the implied ERP at the start of a year and the market goes up 20% during the course of the year and that you compute the implied ERP again at the end of the year. Assuming that the risk free rate and growth rate do not change over the course of the year, which of the following would you expect to happen to the implied ERP? a. The ERP will go down b. The ERP will go down, if the earnings/ cash flows went up by less thanc. The ERP will go down, if the earnings/ cash flows went up by more than20% during the year d. The ERP will not change e. The ERP will go up","b. The ERP will go down, if the earnings/ cash flows went up by less than 20% during the year. If the growth rate and risk free rate don’t change, the effect will depend upon how much stocks go up, relative to earnings/cashflows. If the stock market goes up by more than earnings go up, the ERP will go down. 2. a. You will over estimate the implied ERP. When you use an upwardly biased expected growth in earnings, you will get a higher IRR (expected return on stocks) for investing in stocks. That, in turn, will lead to too high an estimate for the ERP.",
SESSION5,Q2,"To compute the implied ERP, one input that you need is the expected growth rate in earnings/cash flows in future years. That input can be estimated by looking at analyst estimates of growth in earnings for individual companies, but there are studies that indicate that these estimates are biased upwards. Assuming that these growth rates are biased upwards, what effect will it have on your computed ERP?a. You will over estimate the implied ERP b. You will under estimate the implied ERP c. You could under or over estimate the implied ERP","a. You will over estimate the implied ERP. When you use an upwardly biased expected growth in earnings, you will get a higher IRR (expected return on stocks) for investing in stocks. That, in turn, will lead to too high an estimate for the ERP",
SESSION5,Q3,"One argument made by those who use a historical ERP is that using it is defensible, even if it is wrong, as long as you use the same ERP in all your valuations. Assume that the implied ERP is greater than the historical ERP and that you use the historical ERP to value all stocks. Which of the following will you find? a. You will under value all stocks equally b. You will over value all stocks equally c. You will under value all stocks, but you will undervalue riskier stocksd. You will over value all stocks, but you will over value riskier stocks more than safe stockse. You will over value all stocks, but you will over value safe stocks more than riskier stocks","d. You will over value all stocks, but you will over value riskier stocks more than safe stocks. By using too low an ERP, you will end up with too low a cost of equity/capital, and over estimate the value, but the effect will be a function of your relative risk measure. If you use beta as your measure of relative risk, you will under estimate the cost of equity more for high beta stocks than for low beta stocks, and consequently over value them by more.",
SESSION5,Q4,"Historically, the implied equity risk premium in the United States have been about twice the default spread on Baa corporate bonds. Assume that the equity risk premium has dropped to 4% and that the Baa default spread is now 3%. Which of the following would you do as an investor, assuming that you expect normalcy to return? a. Buy stocks and buy bonds b. Buy stocks and sell bonds c. Sell stocks and buy bondsd. Sell stocks and sell bonds e. Do nothing",d. Sell stocks and buy bonds. You would expect equity risk premiums to go up to 6% or default spreads to go down to 2% or both to move (but in opposite directions).,
SESSION5,Q5,"One measure of expected return from real estate is the capitalization rate, the rate used to convert the earnings on a property into its estimated value. Assuming that you were interested in investing in real estate, which of the following scenarios would be your best opportunity to do so?5. One measure of expected return from real estate is the capitalization rate, the rate used to convert the earnings on a property into its estimated value. Assuming that you were interested in investing in real estate, which of the following scenarios would be your best opportunity to do so? a. High capitalization rates, High PE ratios, High bond default spreads b. High capitalization rates, Low PE ratios, Low bond default spreads c. High capitalization rates, High PE ratios, Low bond default spreads d. High capitalization rates, Low PE ratios, High bond default spreads e. None of the above","c. High capitalization rates, High PE ratios, Low bond default spread. High PE ratios, other things remaining equal, translate into low equity risk premiums. You want to get into real estate when you get high risk premiums on real estate when you are getting low risk premiums on equity and bonds.",
SESSION6,Q2,"If you have to estimate a regression beta for a publicly traded US technology company, listed on the NASDAQ, whose largest stockholders are global mutual funds, which of the following will yield your best estimate of the regression beta? a. A regression of the stock returns against a technology stock index b. A regression of the stock returns against the NASDAQ c. A regression of the stock returns against the S&P 500 d. A regression of the stock returns against the MSCI e. None of the above","d. A regression of the stock returns against the MSCI. If your marginal investors are globally diversified, they will measure risk against a global equity index.",
SESSION6,Q1,"The standard approach to estimating betas is to run a regression of returns of an individual stock against returns on a market index. Which of the following is a problem with this approach? a. It yields an estimate with significant standard error. b. It is subject to estimation choices: different regression periods, returnc. It will not yield a “good” estimate for the future, if a company’s business mix has changed recently.d. It will not yield a “good” estimate for the future, if a company’s financial leverage has changed over the regression periode. All of the above.","All of the above. Regression betas can be dangerous as a result of each and every one of these. They can be most dangerous when they look good, since that can be accomplished by using a narrow market index",
SESSION6,Q3,"One alternative to a regression beta is to use a sector-‐average beta or bottom-‐up beta. In computing this sector-‐average beta, you have to come up with a list of comparable firms. Assume that you are trying to compute the beta for a Argentine steel company. Which of the following is likely to yield the best estimate?3. One alternative to a regression beta is to use a sector-‐average beta or bottom-‐up beta. In computing this sector-‐average beta, you have to come up with a list of comparable firms. Assume that you are trying to compute the beta for a Argentine steel company. Which of the following is likely to yield the best estimate? a. A simple average of betas of 4 Argentine steel companies b. A simple average of betas of 12 Latin American steel companies c. A simple average of betas of 85 emerging market steel companies d. A market-‐cap weighted average of betas of 4 Argentine steel companies e. A market-‐cap weighted average of betas of 12 Latin American steel","c. A simple average of betas of 85 emerging market steel companies. For the law of large numbers to work in your favor, you want larger samples rather than smaller ones. Using weighted averages also undercuts the benefits of averaging, since it counts the larger firms more and the smaller firms less.",
SESSION6,Q5,"The CAPM beta is a measure of relative risk, but it comes with significant baggage (a belief in modern portfolio theory, a trust that stock prices are driven a. A ratio of standard deviation in your company’s stock price to the average standard deviation across all stocksb. An implied beta, backed out of current stock prices and expected future cash flowsc.
