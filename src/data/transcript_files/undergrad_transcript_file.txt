hi welcome to valuation i know many of you come in with preconceptions about what this class is about and rather than feed into those preconceptions i'd like to talk about what this class is not about and in the process perhaps perhaps you will get a sense of what this class is about i know for many of you valuation is a set of equations and formula and models and perhaps that is what you're expecting to get as science i'm sorry to disappoint you but valuation is not a science it is a craft and the essence of a craft is you learn through trial and error there is no perfect way of doing things there's a better way of doing things put simply you don't learn valuation by talking about it or watching other people talk about it so i hope that this class will help you learn valuation as a craft by doing it you will find that as you work through this class it will get easier when you start it's going to be difficult that's the nature of a craft and as you get more comfortable you'll start to get more comfortable also deviating from a script rather than cook from a recipe you'll be able to cook on your own second i know for many of you you're expecting a class built around valuing publicly traded companies you want to value the coca-colas the airbnbs the ubers the facebooks of the world and that's okay that's pretty much what many people think about valuation but i hope to make this class much more than valuing just public companies i want to talk about valuing private companies i want to talk about buying small companies and large companies develop market companies in emerging market companies and along the way what i hope you will see in this class is the principles of valuation are universal you don't really need to relearn valuation to value a specific group of companies you just need to take the existing principles evaluation and apply them differently along the way we'll talk about how value can be different from the inside when managers look at a company i suppose from the outside as investors looking at a company not because the principles change but because managers control more of the levers they can change the way a companies run by the end of this class i hope you can value just about any kind of business small or large in whatever sector in whatever market third i want to draw a contrast between two words we use interchangeably in investing value and price let me set this on the table if i believe that markets were efficient what i'm effectively saying the value and the price are pretty much the same thing and if you believe that there's really no point taking this class i believe that the value of an asset is driven by cash flows growth and risk and we're going to talk a lot about how to value an asset in this class but we're also going to talk about how to price that same asset what does that mean to price an asset you look at what other assets just like it are being priced at in the market and i'm going to argue that the pricing process can give your number very different than the value process we're going to go through both valuing and pricing assets along the way and we're going to look at some investments that cannot be valued currencies for instance cannot be valued they can only be priced a collectible cannot be valid it can only be priced fourth i'm going to surprise you i know many of you are going to come into this class expecting to see excel spreadsheets and i'll make a confession i've never opened an excel spreadsheet in the context of a class to me the essence of evaluation is not the collection of numbers that make it but the story behind the numbers you can hear a lot of storytelling in this class but storytelling with a purpose where every number in my evaluation is connected to a story and every story i tell you about a company is connected to numbers finally i don't believe in valuing things just for the sake of valuing them i'm a pragmatist i believe that if you value something you need to be willing to act on it what does that mean if you find something to be undervalued you have to be willing to buy it you're saying so what's so difficult about doing that you're going to recognize that there's a difference between figuring out that something is misvalued and acting on it and that difference can be bridged only with faith faith in what faith in your own value and faith that markets will correct that price will move to value much more difficult than it sounds on the outside so what i hope to during this do during this class is not just deliver the techniques and the tools evaluation but give you some insight into how you can connect stories to value the difference between value and price and how you go about acquiring the faith to be able to act on evaluations i hope you will find this class useful no matter what perspective you bring into the class 
thank you foreign foreign foreign folks can you hear me welcome I'm going to torture you for the next 15 weeks and I can't wait for this to happen um I have four kids have all grown up now and um all of them came and looked at NYU none of them came to NYU so when they were on their college Expedition and they take you and around the university and they lie to you right they say professors always around you can knock on their doors and go in you've had the the those pitches right I would I went with my each of my kids on the NYU pitch I kept my mouth shut but when they get get on top of the the Tish uh the front of Tish they would all say the biggest classroom in the universities right under that talking about this this used to be called schimel it's now called Paulson depending on who's given the most money recently I guess okay and they'd say but nope no classes are ever taught there it's just for show and I almost because I've taught only in this room now for 23 years I hate this rule it's got the Ambiance of Madison Square Garden where the Nets are when the Nicks are losing but it is the biggest room that they can find in these buildings so we're stuck with one thing I don't like about this room is because you don't have a desk in front of you you can't put your name up so you know it it's it's more difficult for me to touch names to faces I'm going to try but before I talk about the class and what's coming I'm going to do a quiz in fact this is going don't worry there are no grades attached to this quiz but every class we're going to start with a quiz you know what we're going to test on what we're going to talk about for the next day 75 minutes it's reverse right you're supposed to do the quiz at the end the reason I do that is almost everything I say is common sense you could figure it out yourself and I want to give you a chance to reason your way to an answer and after the next 75 minutes say why did I waste my money on tuition I knew this already that's mission accomplished so we're going to start today's class with a quiz and this is going to be a little personal don't worry about it I won't remember what you told me anyway so here's my first question if I asked you why you were taking this class give me the reason you're in this class and I'll give you the potential reasons as I said you don't have to tell anybody else so just basically for yourself is it because you think after you take this class you're going to get rich like your neighbor your friend who bought Bitcoin at 500 and I was very wealthy and retired maybe it's because you think it'll help you get a job at an investment bank or a hedge fund or a private Equity house maybe it's to impress your friends and family because you can talk about valuation and they have no idea what you're talking about maybe it's because it'll give you the tools to recognize when you're fooling yourself the biggest challenge in investing is being honest with yourself and we lie to ourselves all the time not just in investing but in life we keep that work with people we don't cut to the front of the line etc etc and we break those rules all the time maybe this class will help you be more honest with yourself maybe you've been told it's an easy yet it's not but maybe you've been told that now and maybe you're doing this for the same reason most people buy Tesla or sell Bitcoin or do whatever else because everybody else is doing it as I said you don't have to tell me I'm going to tell you why I think you should take this class in a few minutes or maybe not take this class in a few minutes maybe I'll talk you out of the class that's not my intent but I'm going to be pretty open about what I hope this class will accomplish but file that away let's see where's my second question if I asked you this is a class about valuation and many each of you has a fuzzy idea right now of what the in fact this class I think is called Equity valuation it's in it's just valuation so take the equity out I don't care what they call it it's evaluation class it's exactly the same class that will be teaching the mbas starting a week from now they have 26 sessions but it's 80 minutes so basically it's the same class exactly the same material okay but here's the question that I have for you if I ask you to describe valuation as a discipline again for the moment make your choice come back and talk about it for the rest of the day which of the following statements do you think best describes valuation it's a science it's an art It's Magic white or black magic you can make the decision or maybe none of the above maybe none of those words fits what we're going to see it's a project does not book there you go third question as I said this is a very unfair quiz because I'm asking you about a class that I was structured I'm going to teach and I'm asking what should be in the class so here's a question about value companies and the question is about which of the following companies is going to be easiest to value you're saying I've never done valuation you don't need to do evaluation to be able to answer the question the first so here are the choices you're a mature company you've been around a long time you have a business model you have a lot of financials and you're in a stable economy second you're a mature company but the economy is in crisis doesn't have to be an emerging market economy it could be a domestic economy in March of 2020 remember in the midst of covert we have no no idea what was coming a young company in a stable Market or a young company in crisis so basically two combinations right would you rather value a mature company or a young company in an economy that's stable or in a crisis this one you probably can answer right now which of those four company or poor groupings is going to be easiest to value for stable or young stable why you have lots of data right you have a crutch you have a business model you can see exactly how they make money and stable economy or economy in crisis can I stable economy who wants to deal with inflation and what the FED might do and whether the economy will open up final question really sorry about me this is a personal question there's no right answer each of us is more comfortable either working with numbers or with stories and you made that judgment very early on I'll tell you when I made that judgment it was when I was 12 years old it was after my first English literature class I was asked to Read Moby Dick and I did I was a good kid I came prepared for a discussion of whales and captains and about 20 minutes into the session I noticed that the instructor was talking about neither so I put up my hand so when are we going to talk about the whale she said there is no will and I said what did I read the wrong book I distinctly remember a big fish going all the way through the book she said it's a metaphor my jaw dropped and the rest of the class was about hidden meanings and things I didn't even have no I had a meaning in the first place I remember coming out of that class with a singular conclusion I said never again am I going to subject myself to that kind of foreign classes like the plague I'm not comfortable with this hidden meaning stuff is algebra one Algebra 2 algebra 3 out of high school and these were the good old days you know it's from the good old days you went to college and you took CL the courses you wanted to take as opposed to the stupid Core Curriculum they make you go through why do you why do you have to take a history class because it'll round out your education you know what they're lying you know why you need to take the history class because they didn't force you to take the history class there would be no need for a history Department who voluntarily says I want to take a history class but then you could take numbers class numbers class numbers degree engineer accountant and then if you could number his job and who do you hang out with are the numbers people and what class are you in evaluation class right you think this is my you know this is my Arena but some of you so let's let's do a show offense how many of you think you're more naturally numbers people okay how many of you are more story people how many of you think you're so rounded that you can do everything there's some of you there are important numbers in this but there's one side you face today I'm going to talk about which of these skills you will need in valuation and you might be surprised at the answer see you ready let's put this away and start on the logistics of this class okay I came to NYU in 1986 I was hired as an assistant professor so I land up in New York I went to UCLA and the first thing I noticed was weather's not as nice and they give me a class security analysis have any of you heard of this class it's a class with a very long and horrid tradition it was a class start in the 1950s at Columbia University by a guy called Ben Graham you might have heard of him if you haven't heard of him you've heard of his most famous student anybody want to guess who's Warren Buffett right it's a class that's been taught forever so they give me this class I take one look at the class they say I don't want to teach this class not a great attitude for an assistant professor's just being hired right they should have fired me on the spot the head of the department is a good guy he said what would you like to teach instead I said I'd like to teach a valuation class and I still remember what he said he's he said don't do it there isn't enough stuff in valuation to fill a class nobody was absolutely right in 1986 there wasn't enough stuff in valuation to fill a classroom there were no books on valuation unless you wanted to use Ben Graham's Security analysis you know in the first edition of that book was published 1934. reflects the time it was written right coming out of the Great Depression if you ever wondered why Graham's Security analysis is so conservative you'd be conservative too if you'd lived through the Great Depression there were no books no but I really really wanted to teach this class and I discovered very early in my academic life that if you want to get anything done at a university the best way to do it is to do it subversively because you try to get official permission you know what had happened right a committee would be formed if you guys had experience with committees being formed get used to it because what happens is committees meet and they meet then they forget what they're meeting about and they keep meeting and they have baby committees that they're called subcommittees and sub subcommittees it's all very incestors committees reporting to each other and if I let it play out 35 years later they'd come back and so you can teach the class but I'd be too old to do it so I said I'd teach your damn security analysis class I didn't use the word dams the head of the department after all and I walked into the room shut the door and remember these were this was 1986 there were no cameras in the classroom I had no idea what I was doing inside that room I could be teaching cooking for 15 weeks and if I give give everybody A's nobody's complaining and I taught a valuation class you know how long it took them to catch on in 2008 I get a call from the Dean's office so we hear you're teaching evaluation class I said yes I've been doing it for 22 years they said we don't see it listed anywhere in the course listings I said that's easy to explain I've been hijacking all these other classes you've been giving me and teaching valuation instead you made me teach this class called equity instruments and markets you know what I'm not interested in instruments I don't care about markets I'm not even that fascinated with Equity you take those three words out what are you left with and I might as well teach evaluation class they said that's not right we should call it valuation I said I agree so if you look at the MBA course listings you'll see valuation shop for the first time in 2000 and 9. and soon after the undergraduates also listed it for some reason the undergraduate program seems to want to call classes something different don't ask me why they called it Equity valuation but last spring when I taught valuation the mbas and undergraduate just like I am doing this year Well my 59th and 60th semesters teaching valuation I'm going to say something about this classroom that's going to encapsulate how I think about valuation how you're going to see me Teach valuation everything I know about valuation I've learned in the course of teaching this class let me repeat that again everything I know about valuation I've learned in the course of teaching this class let me give you a few examples one year into teaching this class 1987 we're still downtown and at that time nyu's graduate business school was right next to the American Stock Exchange I was teaching my I taught my valuation class in the morning I come back to my office I look out of my window and I can see everybody from the American Stock Exchange floors out on the street so what happened fire alarm went off it was October 19th of 1987. anybody remember what happened that day too too long ago yeah it was a one day bear Market you know what the S P 500 is down by in that one day 22 think about that if today we had an equivalent day the Dow would be down eight thousand points we'd freak out right the people were freaked out the end of the word was coming two days later I was in front of my evaluation class and guess what the first question I was asked was how with the evaluation tools can you explain a one-day drop in the entire well it's not one stock it's the entire Market how do you explain it 22 drop I didn't know the answer but I tried this is going to be a pattern you noticed me even when I don't know the answer I'll just make up stuff I tried but in the process I started thinking about how do you explain Market crises and it stood me in good stead so when the covet crash happened in the first few months of 2020 I went back to what I learned on that day in October 19th of 1987. move forward a decade in the 1990s and we discovered or we saw a phenomenon we'd never seen in public markets before young companies with lots of potential no established business model going into markets those companies are always around but before the 1990s Venture capitalists invest in the companies remember companies like apple and Microsoft when they went public in the 1980s were already established companies in terms of a business model but the first time in the 1990s you saw these companies jump the queue and go public I still remember the day in 1997. somebody in my class put up their hand said can you value this company called amazon.com you know what Amazon did in 1997 it was an online book retailer tiny company big money losing company and like a fool I said let's try and I valued amazon.com in class that year and when I tried to Value it and I looked at the established literature there was nothing there about how to Value companies that lots of potential but were money losing with small revenues but to come up with ways of doing it I still tell people everything I know about valuing young companies I learned in the process of valuing Amazon in 1997. you're going to see a few late evaluations of Amazon that I've done but that first valuation was a slog because everything had to be figured out then you move forward another decade in 2008 you're in a full-fledged marketing Market crisis but the market crisis created by Banks Behaving Badly and again somebody puts up their hand says why when Banks behave badly and they take batteries should the rest of us feel the pain let's talk about how when Banks behave badly there are side costs for everybody else and everybody else's values impacted again something I hadn't thought about till 2008 and then you get to the last decade I call this a decade of the numbers company and let's play it's a decade where you saw a company like Facebook and Twitter and whole host of social media companies go public let me ask you a question what is the most impressive number at Facebook other than the amount the billions of dollars they're throwing down a hole called metaverse now but take a step back from it what's the most impressive number at Facebook is it their revenues there are lots of companies have more revenues subscribers right it's a in terms of entertainment companies you know I'm sorry users basically because how many users does Facebook have their ecosystem you can Facebook Instagram WhatsApp about three billion users carry number right one out of every two adults walking the face of the Earth isn't the Facebook ecosystem not no not revenues not only with Netflix it's number of subscribers no Entertainment Company until Netflix came along had that many subscribers 220 million subscribers with the Uber there's a fact there are a hundred million writers you see where I'm going until the last decade when companies wanted to impress you they talked about revenues and earnings and all of a sudden companies are talking about users and subscribers and customer numbers and in 2017 again this is how every single question I have in this class gets triggered somebody puts up their hand and says can you value a Netflix subscriber notice a question cannot can you value Netflix because you can always value Netflix from the top down but can you value a subscriber to Netflix can you help me out how would you value Netflix subscriber what would you need to know first is cost of acquiring a subscriber but once you've acquired the subscriber what's the value of the subscriber go to Netflix get free are you a Netflix subscriber let me pick on somebody are you a Netflix subscriber okay so what do you do for Netflix every month okay subscription fee right fifteen dollars a month 22 depending on whether you get the premium subscription with four people can watch at a time or two people I assume you will do the only two 15 a month Yeah so basically I know Netflix gets about a hundred and eighty dollars a year from you but to Value you as a subscriber you know what else I have to estimate right how long will you stay on as a subscriber in user-based companies this is based on What's called the churned rate now how many times and let's face it subscription-based models are sticky this morning I was making a list of all the subscriptions I have really I've been subscribing to that for four years I've never even been there so if I give you the expected life that a subscriber stays on and what you can collect from a subscriber and if you could tell me what it costs you to service a subscriber I can value a subscriber so in 2017 I valued a Netflix subscriber it took a couple of weeks to develop the framework but then I used it to value a Spotify subscriber an Amazon Prime member an Uber Rider different models but basically the same principles again I hadn't thought about that until somebody asked the question and then you get to 2020. and I was actually teaching this class in the spring semester January February look just like any other semester then we come back in early March and we get this notification man while you're saying go home three weeks but you'll be back three weeks right we went home and we were gone for like a year and a half but I was teaching the class still from my home in La Jolla I don't live in New York I live in California for obvious reasons other than the fact that I like to pay taxes but I was teaching the class but we I was teaching the class in the midst of an experiment that had never been run before you know what the experiment was we shut the global economy down we had no idea what would happen we tried to open it you know it's like turning a big machine off say please God when we turn it back on let it come on so I remember the end of March in the middle of the class I said let's value Boeing and if you remember at the end of March boring looked like it might never really come back because you sell to the airlines the airlines are not flying what happens and I remember many people think hey you know let's wait for this to pass that's not a choice right you got to Value companies in the world you're in not the world you wished you were in actually you know I have a YouTube video that you can see of my Boeing valuation from March 23rd of 2020 the absolute bottom of that crisis but again in the process of doing it I learned about what to in fact during the Russian invasion of Ukraine I tried to Value Ukrainian Mining Company I have to confess finally I had to give up this is beyond my reach even in terms of uncertainty you're saying but those were interesting semesters ours is so boring trust me interesting things will happen in the next four months and be careful what you wish for When You Wish For interesting things because what's a Chinese course may you live in interesting times we're living in interesting times who knows what the next four months will deliver so this is a class that you know reflects my 36 37 years of teaching the class and all of the bad and good experience along the way and hopefully somewhere in this process you know so what I'd like to do first let me do the logistical part before I do this finally we're in person I mean I taught this class entirely online one semester 2021 my office is in the other building 969 so you know if you want to find me you can try but I'm usually not there okay my email address is you know it's right up there if you want to send me missives in the middle of the night I'll read the next morning um my home page and I'll come back and talk about what you will find for this class on there I don't use brightspace or whatever learning management system is I pay act like I do but not really everything happens in my site I have office hours just before my classes and um because I teach the MBA class just before yours from 1 30 to 3 12 to 1 15. but I have a principle called a fair game principle you know how it works if you find me I'm fair game which means for the next 15 weeks I'm going to try to make it as difficult as possible for you to find me for instance I've discovered that if you take the stairs nobody finds you because everybody takes the elevators if you take the elevator now I remember one year when I when I was teaching this class at that time you know it used there used to be a building called codes where you have the new building now so it used to be the gym for NYU and I'd show up you know in the middle of the day to do my workout and the person from the class I was teaching that semester would show up at exactly the same time get on the treadmill right next to mine and ask me questions all the way to so I will introduce a rule that if my heartbeat exceeds 120 per hour per minute per second or whatever it is I'm not responsible for any of the answers I will get but truly speaking if you find me I'm fair games if you have any questions try to find the teaching us Kathleen is right here so and Alice and so will be back by Wednesday so they will be the Tas they don't grade the stuff I do your grading so if you get pissed off it's me you got to take it out on but I'll be sending out their office hours and they do a review session each week where they work through prompts from past quizzes so take advantage of that so with that lead-in what I'd like to do is talk a little bit about the broad themes for this class and what I'm going to say for the next 30 minutes or so is to me the most critical part of the class everything else is icing on the cake so let's start with the first question as to use valuation a science or an art it's a question I get asked all the time so let's dig through it his valuation of science Let's uh ask a simpler question is mathematics a science it's the only pure science in fact mathematicians are convinced that the rest of us are imposters so let me ask you a follow-up question what is it about mathematics that makes it a science it's absolute right what's two plus three I'm not testing two plus three is five right hand left hand calculator computer North Pole South Pole it's not might be five it could be five it is five and if you get any other answer you're wrong physics is mostly a science right you all go to the 11th floor you jump out of a window can you get a window open I don't know but let's say you jump out of a window you don't fall in the order of your IQs or where you are in the corporate hierarchy you just fall laws of gravity are the laws of gravity physics is mostly in science but if the essence of a science is you get the inputs right you're going to get the output right is there any chance that valuation can be a science I'm just finishing my updated valuation of Tesla right it started yesterday I hope to be done by tomorrow and perhaps put it out there I'm trying my best you know how many uncertainties you have to deal with in value Tesla in addition to all of the uncertainties you deal with in a normal company you have a teenager running the company right a Visionary teenager but he does some you know what the essence of a teenager is I'm calling them corporate teenagers what do they do they do what teenage and you you remember these days not that long ago what do teenagers do every day they get up they look in the mirror they say I have lots of potential what can I do today to screw it all up so there's an immense amount of uncertainty I'm going to try my best I'm going to make my best inputs but guess what the value that I get is going to be absolutely wrong because things will happen valuation can never be assigned so the sooner we accept that the healthier the discussion evaluation will become you know what I am not a great fan of accounting valuation accountants have felt left out for a while so you want to be relevant again so they've jumped into my Arena and they keep trying to do things in valuation but they think like accountants do which is when in doubt write a few more rules they want to convert valuation to science and they're convinced that if they write more rules it's going to become more scientific it's going nowhere valuation is definitely not a science so it must be an art right so let's take a a simpler example is painting an art not painting your house you know paintings I'm talking about the ones in the museums no I still remember when my oldest son he's now 33 when he was eight years old I took him to the Met for a Picasso exhibit he lasted about 30 minutes that's how long eight-year-olds last in a museum when he come out and I said Ryan what do you think of those that exhibit he said dad I was not impressed I said what it's a Picasso exhibit he said this guy can't get the nose in the right place have you noticed about Picasso the nose comes out of the side of the head the top of the head the back of the head he was either drugged or drunk it was given Picasso's history he's probably both but whatever the reason we've decided collectively that picassos are special and we thank God my son is not the appraiser because so it'll be going for 50 cents a piece the essence of an art is it really cannot be taught and guard valuation is not an art or wasted 37 years of my life trying to teach something that cannot be taught so if it's not a science and it's not an art what the heck is it the word I used to describe valuation is it's a craft I'll tell you the discipline that I think comes closest to valuation it's cooking think of how you learn cooking you can watch cooking shows right my daughter used to watch the Food Network all day long chopped episode after chopped episode Beat Bobby Flay Beat Bobby Flay for a long time she couldn't cook a lick but she knew exactly in theory how you made a souffle you don't learn cooking by watching cooking shows you don't learn cooking by reading cookbooks you learn cooking by cooking and the first time you cook what happens disaster fire alarms go off I still remember the first time I scrambled eggs nobody told me I was supposed to spray the damn pan I finished egg looks good but it won't come off the pan and egg go in the trash and I remembered a very important lesson that I've remembered since gray the pan before you cook the egg you learn cooking by doing and the first time you do it will be difficult remember that you learn valuation by doing which means the next 15 weeks or in a sense if all you do is come to classes work through problems you're not learning valuation you learn valuation by doing and the more companies you value and the more diverse the companies become the better it will become if all you do is cook pasta after pasta you'll get really good at cooking pasta but if I said can you make me a curry you said I can't do that in valuation of all you do is value Steel company after Steel company maybe get really good at welding steel companies should I come to you with the tech company never done that before so I'm going to make you get out of your safety zone and value companies that you don't feel comfortable valuing because that's how you learn valuation so that's the first thing second one and this is something you've seen me return to over and over again is I'm going to draw a contrast between two words that we use interchangeably in valuation that we should not the words are value and price let me back up we know what determines the value of an asset or a business or a company we've always known this it's cash flows growth and risk you can dance around this create elaborate models but it's cash flows growth and risk when I say we've always known this we act like we invented valuation a hundred years ago but that Venetian glass makers sold his business in the Middle Ages thought about cash flows growth and risk probably more directly than the people today with all the models kind of confusing them so values driven by cash flows growth and risk you have to understand the business to value a company because without understanding whether in a high margin business or a low margin business what are you going to do so probably my zoom the heck is that whatever it is I have no idea so values driven by cash flows growth and risk you know it determines price demand and supply this environment demand and Supply driven by cash flows growth and risk Maybe but you know what else determines demand and supply mood momentum Revenge he said what Revenge well in 2021 it's a company called GameStop remember that GameStop is this company that used to be in malls in fact you guys are probably too young to remember in GameStop dominated mall traffic my kids would always want to go into GameStop because you could play games and see what the games look like but it's a dying business dying business why because malls are dying everything's moving online so by the start of 2021 GameStop was on its Pathway to Annette her game was over the business and the stock price had dropped it was one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the uh in in among U.S equities you know what shortings right people are selling it to return basically because they thought the price is going to go to zero then early in 2021 something magical happened a group of people gathered together on a Reddit site called Wall Street bets and they decided to buy GameStop and they succeeded even beyond their wildest imagination they pushed the price up from 15 per share to 400 per share I was puzzled I said what is it that they see in GameStop that makes them believe that this company could be worth four dollars per share so I went on the Wall Street bets side there was tortures reading through the rationale but here was the overwhelming team that came through you know why they were pushing the price up not because they thought GameStop was coming back or because you know they thought the founder of Chewie Ryan Cohen was going to turn the company around they were doing it because they wanted to get revenge against whom who were they trying to run out of business hedge funds why because they had big student loans and they're convinced that if Citadel hadn't done this that student loan would have been half what it was whatever the reason it was Revenge do you think that makes no sense it makes complete sense think about it what's a stronger human emotion Revenge or rational thought it's no brainer what I'm trying to say is price is driven by lots of forces have nothing to do with fundamentals in fact there's a whole area of Finance we've developed over the last 40 years to try to explain why price can deviate from value called behavioral Finance what does it do it takes psychological insights into how people behave and say hey that's why stock prices can stay higher than that as I said this class I'm going to draw a contrast between value and price we're going to talk first about value I'm going to focus a lot on cash flows growth and risk but many of you when you go out there for jobs you're not going to be valuing companies you're going to be pricing them what do you think banks do they don't value companies their price up we're going to talk about how to price companies better because in pricing here's what you do you look at what other people are paying for similar lots of subjective judgments have similar companies and you pay based on that so people are paying a lot for other user-based companies they're paying a hundred dollars a use and you have 300 million users I put your value 30 billion we're going to draw the contrast between value and price because I think even among people who claim to have done valuation per living for 30 or 40 years is a tremendous amount of confusion but what exactly they're doing that's not a good place to be so we're going to draw that contrast value versus price 30. this is a class about valuing just about anything and what we can't value we will press so this is not just about valuing you know publicly traded large companies it's about private companies and public companies young companies and all companies develop Market companies and Emerging Market companies and guess what the rules stay the same no matter which of those companies would so I'm going to start with that we're going to talk about how to value just about any ask with cash flows but how do you value Picasso you can't value it you can price how do you price picassas what did I say you do in pricing you look for what other people are paying for similar assets with a Picasso and you're an appraiser let's say that's your job what do you do you look to see what other people have paid for picassos he said this is a bigger pickup I don't know how you do this but that's why I'm not in the but you know you know remember the the the the Mona Lisa look alike that the Saudis bought for like 400 million you know why it went 400 million it's a awful looking picture if you ask me but because the Mona Lisa has worked so much this must be what 400 million so we're going to talk about pricing as well and in that process we can talk about pricing not just companies we can talk about pricing real estate remember is all pricing all the time you know what I mean by pricing if you buy an apartment in New York City first you must be really rich but if you do think of how the realtor comes up with the number of or the for the apartment they don't do a discounted cash flow evaluation of the apartment they look to see what other pricing is more the norm than the exception and in the process maybe we'll ask the question how do you price Bitcoin you know you can't value Bitcoin why can't you value Bitcoin for the same reasons you can't value the US dollar it's a if it's a currency you can't value currency you can price it you call it an exchange rate think of the price of Bitcoin as an exchange rate and I think that's a healthy discussion is Bitcoin a good currency would you be willing to give up twenty thousand dollars for one Bitcoin which is what people are and that's a discussion we can have and that's a fair discussion but you'd be amazed at how often people say what's a value Bitcoin do not use the word value for assets that don't have cash flows you can't you know you can price Bitcoin you can price the Mickey Mantle rookie card but you cannot value those because there are no cash flows and along the way we'll also talk about the one aspect of this class where you draw on things that have happened much of this class you draw on core principles that have been around forever but in the last 50 years we've had these option pricing models developed primarily to value options in this class we're not going to use them to value options we're going to Value companies or businesses or assets with a contingent cash flows sounds mysterious right but let's suppose you have a young pharmaceutical company it's working on this vaccine for something that nobody's ever seen before it's an mRNA vaccine you're probably saying who's ever going to need that vaccine 2018-2019 you're buying a contingent cash flow if the vaccine gets approved this company could be worth billions if it doesn't it's worth nothing you're not valuing a traditional asset so we're going to talk about sets of businesses or assets which have contingent cash flows and we're going to use those to Value not just young Pharma companies but a platform how many times have you seen people say well I have 300 million users on my platform I haven't figured out how to make money in a few years ago two years ago I valued this company called paytm and I made the mistake of putting its app on my phone paytm is this Indian online Payment Processing Company and every day they offer me free stuff you know what they're very good at adding users you know what they're not good at figuring out how to make money on those users the question you ask is is having 350 million users which is what they have on their platform worth something the answer is absolutely if you get the right people running the company we're going to use option pricing to Value assets like those which brings me to my fourth theme and this goes back to the question I asked you what are you more comfortable doing telling stories or working with numbers and at that time I said you probably are thinking right now that good valuation is all about numbers and if you go to work for an investment bank that's what you become right an Excel Ninja you open up these big models and you take line item after line Bankers can't value 20 in a brown paper bag if you put in front of them but they can build elaborate models to show you the twenty dollars is really worth fifty dollars we're in a bad place in valuation because of two developments and this is going to sound contradictory you know the two developments are the first is we have far more data than we used to have that's good right the second is we're more powerful tools than we ever did and here's a contradiction even as the amount of data we have and the tools we have become more powerful evaluations are actually getting qualitatively less good not better and the reason is we tend to hang out with people who think like as you go to work for a bank you're all Excel ninjas you think every valuation is line item 15 you know just get that line item right and I think we need to step back we'll come back and talk more about this process but a good valuation is a bridge between stories and numbers say what are you talking about when I value a company you know we're going to put my Tesla valuation out tomorrow you know what my revenues are in 2032 for Tesla about 400 billion dollars the revenues right now are about 93 billion so I'm quadrupling revenues and you ask me why are my revenues 400 billion in your debt you know the answer you don't want to hear is it's because I used to 25 growth rate for the next five years and it tells you absolutely nothing right I need to tell you a story about Tesla that explains a 400 billion that electric cars are going to dominate the automobile business and that Tesla is going to have a dominant market share of that business and you can then ask me to defend each of those but that's what you need as an answer I'm going to use a margin of 20 you know why that should surprise you because a typical automobile company is margins of 8 10 12 percent a software companies margins of 30 35 so when I use a 20 margin and they ask me why I'm using the margin I should tell you a story about Tesla that's a mix of automobile and technology that says look this is not a traditional Auto Company an electric car is more iPhone than Chevy and because of that it can have a higher margins again I could be completely wrong but every number in my valuation has to have a story to back it up and every story you tell me about a company think about some of the stories are in the Great amazing brand name great CEO top technology has to find a number that goes with it so if you're a number cruncher you need to get comfortable with the storytelling and if you're a store I'll tell you my vision for this class if you're a number cruncher by the end of this class I hope you trust your imagination enough to be able to tell stories because remember you've spent a lifetime bludgeoning that poor thing into the ground because at every step if you're in a number crunchy class if you come up with something imaginary push that down and I'll go back to the numbers and if you're a Storyteller I hope by the end of this class you develop enough discipline to not tell me fairy tales get comfortable enough with the numbers so to me the essence of somebody's good evaluation you're either a disciplined Storyteller or an imaginative number cruncher been teaching this class for 37 years guess which group I always have more trouble with getting storytellers to develop discipline on number crunches to tell stories it's not even close it's always the number crunches you give me a hundred history majors I can teach them enough valuation to be able to Value companies next week give me 100 Engineers I am screwed so if you're a number crunch I need to let go of that need because if you're a number crunchy you always want closure right until you get that absolute certainty you got this right you can't let go you need to let go there's a point in valuation where you have to take the karmic View you know the karmic views I've done everything I can I've made my best Testament it's time to move on because if you get stuck on an input saying I need certainly you're never going to get closure how the heck could you ever feel certainly about how many electric cars are going to be sold in 2032 you're not God if you've been operating under that delusion you're far bigger prompt in this class but there are things you and I can never figure out because there are too many uncertainties which brings me to my final theme for this class I'm going to use a word that you probably don't expect to see in evaluation class it's fake I think what's Faith got to do with it everything I'll be upfront I don't do Consulting I don't do expert witness work in other words I don't do valuation for others so it's only reason left to do valuation because I'm curious come on I have far better things to be curious about I do valuation because I want to act on my valuations you know what I mean by that I value a company and if I find Tesla to be undervalued I want to be able to buy it you think what's the big deal to act on your valuations you need faith but faith in your value do you see why you need Faith any value value the company followed all the rules but you need to I trust that number and second faith that the price will adjust to the value why am I using the word faith what's the essence of faith if you ask me to prove that my value is right I'm gonna say I can't prove it no if you ask me to prove that price will adjust to Value I can't do that either just think of it as the equivalent of going to church or Temple or wherever you go and asking the priest you know you know can you prove to me that God exists and unless you have a priest to make substance he's going to have faith probably pisses you off to no end because give me proof and faith is not something I can teach but I can talk about why I have faith and when that faith has been shaken I've never had much patience for people who talk on absolutes like all those people to go to go to Omaha every year you know the group I'm talking about who think that they have the answer because Warren Buffett has told them the right answer I don't have that much I I don't believe in that absoluteism I estimate value but you know what it's always my faith is always being tested I'll give you an example let's say I buy Tesla tomorrow at 135 or whatever it's trading at right now and it's because I think the stock is worth 165. what happens the day after the stock drops to 115. it's the market knocking on your dosing do you still have faith get used to that that's the nature of investing and most people don't have faith so that's something you have to decide for yourself and you might decide you have no faith in which case what should you do buy index funds and move on live the rest of your life you can live a perfectly happy life without ever buying a stock and making money trust me but that's a healthy conclusion arrive at so that's something to think about as you get through is do I have faith and the first time you value a company don't be surprised if you're a little shaky about no this is a value maybe I got something wrong it's natural if you don't feel any questioning there's something wrong with you right yeah I'm absolutely certain about this number how the heck did he get that much certainty you're either a sociopath oh you got a direct connection to God that I'd love to have as well because this is not something you can feel sure about so let me be the outline for the class we're going to start with the first few sessions focused on the big picture how things connect together now the reason I do that is often when you start to dig into the inputs it's easy to get lost so when we talk about risk premiums you're saying why are we talking about this again betas what is that got to do the big pictures but basically going to frame everything we're going to do in the class and where things fit in so when we get there saying okay that's why we're doing this then we're going to move on to the inputs into intrinsic value and what did I say there were cash flows growth and risk we're going to talk about how to estimate those as best as we can given the data we have and we're also going to talk about loose sense in valuation how do you tie up loose x what do you do for companies a lot of cash what if there's a lawsuit hanging over the company okay then we're going to move on to the pricing part because and in the process the intrinsic evaluation we will towards the end of the intrinsic evaluation section actually value entire companies you can see all the pieces come into play probably going to Value 15 20 companies very diverse from Young startups to all companies whose value just to depress you all value Bed Bath and Beyond it's already depressing if you've gone into a Bed Bath and Beyond which I think is an incredibly depressing experience but value is even more depressing so how did the company ever get to this point in the first place then we're going to talk about price and in the process we're going to talk about standardizing price and comparing across companies so what do you mean standardizing price you can't compare the price per share across companies if you did what's the most expensive company in the US if you just look at the price per share it's Berkshire Hathaway which is what four hundred thousand dollars per share three fifty thousand dollars per cent the cheapest stock is some penny stock right but that's absurd because price per share is arbitrary why because I could do a two for one stock splitting my price goes down by 50 doesn't make any cheaper and because we can't compare price per share across companies we divide the price by something to standardize things like what like earnings price earnings ratio divided by Book value price to book ratio just a standardized price and the process of pricing we're gonna look at different multiples and how to do pricing better once you've got intrinsic valuation and pricing done we're going to talk about asset based valuation what is that you look at a company and rather than value the whole company valued in pieces right now for instance you have to Value GE there's no company left it's a Walking Dead company of pieces you know the healthcare business the aircraft business the kg capital we'll talk about some of the parts asset-based valuation we'll spend a session on valuing private business using only a session because to value a privately owned business you don't have to change the rules still cash flows growth and risk but you have to bring in some special perspectives like what I think the fact that a private business might depend on its own or a great deal more so if you have a plumbing business it's not just a business it's a plumber the plumber has you know links to businesses and if the plumber basically passes away there goes the business it's called a key person component and it's not just private businesses right we just mentioned Tesla one of the questions I've always had with Tesla is what would you do if you woke up one day and you looked at the news and it said Elon Musk checks into rehab but would you be surprised probably not right it's an amazing guy but he clearly seems to have some issues what would happen to the value of Tesla as a company this has always been the question that overhangs the company but in private business it's front and center so we're going to talk about what you do differently in private company valuation you're going to be surprised 90 you do the same but there are 10 percent of the time you do different things we'll talk about those and then we'll bring in this option issue and that's what we talked about valuing young Pharma companies are valuing a platform how option pricing can help you so that's basically the structure of the class and the line in sessions 26 and 27 I'm going to focus on special aspects of valuation one is acquisition value what's different about valuation in m a and the answer is nothing other than the fact that people like to overpay in their Bank Bankers basically want the deal to get done we'll talk about some of the ways in which bad deals get a pathway to getting done and in the second to last session we'll focus on how do you change the value of a business you know why that matters because much of the class we're going to spend looking from the outside in at companies in that session I'm going to take you on the inside say you're the CEO of Disney stocks doing badly values probably dropped what can you do to increase the value of the company it's my Corporate Finance compressed into one session because Corporate Finance I teach corporate Financial valuation the mbas the MMA has always ask me what's the difference in the two classes it's the same class I just give them different names it's actually the principles are the same but in corporate finance you look at companies from the inside out in valuation look at companies in the outside and and session 27 is going to be that Inside Out view of companies so those of you are interested in running your own business going into Consulting this session you can talk about the levers you can look at so how do I change the value of a company so that's a structure of what's coming in terms of pre-season prep it's probably too late because the season's already begun you should have three emails from you already right starting today you're probably going to get an email every day for the rest of the semester but in the very first email I said look I'm not going to call on you don't need to be a mad genius but the three skill sets I would like you to kind of brush up on the first is much as I dump on accountants our raw data comes from accounting statements if you are uncertain about what the differences between operating income and net income don't admit to it right now but I was 12 session class in accounting and I'm not an accountant I teach in my own way accounting is probably horrified by what I teach in this class but it's about learning just enough accounting that you can make it through that raw data second I have a statistics class why because what did I say in the biggest change in valuation huge amounts of data were drowning in data and we need to figure out ways to take that data and make it manageable that's what statistics should be about that's unfortunately not how statistics classes get taught so again I have my own version of a statistics class on my website that you can take it's 12 sessions now if you still don't know what a multiple regression is why you should care maybe you should watch that class and the third is foundations of Finance if you still think present value is a button on your calculator and you really don't get the intuitive Foundation I would strongly recommend taking that foundations class because ninety percent of Finance is present value and understanding what it is that drives present value why it changes is critical to doing this right so that's pre-season prep for those for many of you you might not need it because you feel ready but I told you I'm going to that for the next 15 weeks I will take over your lives I'll tell you how I'm going to take over the week starts on Monday you'll have class and right after the class like today's class you get an email from me you know the email will contain what we did in the class but I was just in the class I know physically you were here but there will be days where physically you might be here but mentally you might be elsewhere and say if you left the class mentally here's what we did during the class Tuesdays you get a valuation of the week what is that I'm going to pick a company to value like next week I might you know put out my Tesla valuation with my post on why I value the company then I'm going to invite you to Value Tesla on your own your reaction is going to be it's only week two of the class we haven't learned enough could do whatever you feel comfortable doing so in the first valuation you might change the third decimal on the risk-free rate leave everything else at my numbers and tell me look I got the same value that you did I'm just going to let it go because that's not healthy that you all get the same value but every week I'll put up a valuation of the week and I'll go all over the place I think one of them is the valuation of the Los Angeles Clippers when Steve armor bought it so we're going to Value companies we're going to Value businesses and I'm going to remember I said I want to get you out of your comfort zone so across the next 15 weeks you're going to Value 14 companies essentially very different companies and here's what's going to happen it's always happens I feel comfortable making this prediction as we go further and further into this class you're going to find yourself more willing to disagree with me and that's good it's good because you say I don't like your growth rate I'm going to use a low growth good that's what valuation should be about we should be debating the story and the valuations so Tuesday I'll send an evaluation of the week no grades so if you completely ignore these valuations of the week I'm not going to you know chase you down so you didn't do the valuation of the week but I'm going to create a Google shared spreadsheet think of this as a crowd valuation I'll put my valuation the first row and each of you as you value the company can put your evaluations down let's see what the crowd valuation of Tesla works out to be so you can see what the typical value is what's high would slow now on Wednesday we will have another class obviously Monday Wednesday and on Wednesday you will also get what's called a weekly challenge what's a weekly challenge every week we'll cover something like next week we might cover risk readings the weekly challenge I'm going to take whatever we did in class and make you stretch Can you estimate the risk free rate in zombie and quacher and if you've been in the class you'll have the tools but it'll require that you get creative try it out again completely optional the way somebody described this class like drinking out of a house water coming at you you might decide I don't like this I'll just take a little trickle so but I'm going to give you the host and you can decide what matters on Thursday you get an email from me reminding you where you should be on your project you're saying what project that pain is coming I describe it to you but your project already you might not realize this but your project already started the minute you walked into class and I'll talk about that project and every Thursday is my nagging email so where are you because I know exactly what you guys will do because a project is not due till May 8th many of you will not start even thinking about the project till April 23rd I can't stop that but I can nag you and nag you and maybe the guilt will build up to a point oh my God I'm way behind so I'll send you a timeline here's where you should be it's like a GPS so I'm not there yet okay maybe you will respond maybe you would on Friday I will do a webcast which applies in practice so for instance when you talk about risk credits I'll do a webcast on how I estimate a risk related Indonesian rupee I take you through where I get the data how I clean up for it so you can see it play out in practice on Saturday you get a Weekly Newsletter don't look at this for breaking news I'm not CNN but the newsletter will basically summarize what we did that week what you might have missed if you were away for the weeks again kind of because let's face it when you're a class with 350 other people it's easy to get lost and feel that nobody's noticed that you I'm going to try to catch you if you get lost and these are all my devices to kind of keep you connected to the class on Sunday I'll send you the weekly challenge remember the one I sent you on Wednesday I'll send you my solution but again it's not for grading so if you worked on it you can compare Your solution to mine yeah and then you wake up on Monday and we'll repeat the process again so that's the structure of the class and I'm not and I'm not doing it to scare you but just to get you a sense where in terms of the logistics of the class while I will do Zoom sessions I would like you to be in the class I don't think it's that painful to be here but I understand you know sometimes you might have to travel so there will be the live Zoom it'll be recorded so basically you can catch there's no excuse for falling behind so even if you're sick at home you should be able to watch the lectures if you're trapped in a foreign country don't ask me why you're a spy you've been arrested you've been thrown into a Turkish jail as for a Wi-Fi connection so you can watch the classes now you don't you know you can bring if you can bring there's only one thing that you need for the lectures the lecture not packet I sent you the link to the first packet I've told the bookstore to print it but by the time they do it the class is usually over and why do you want to pay those guys that overpriced issue anyway so keep it digitally if you want because you can make the notes on it if you want to print it just don't do it on the printers downstairs wherever they are now because then I hear about it because it's like I think we have 800 Pages 800 pages of slides for this class and 350 times 800 you can work out the math will break every single printer down here so if you're going to print it no please pay the money go to wherever you need to print it or if you work if you're working for somebody they have no idea what's being printed anyway print it off on the side you know actually 350 pages I don't know what that is you know just and then grab it I'll put in the recycling for you and you can take it home no so I'm not encouraging you to break the maybe I am but if you do miss a class catch up there's no reason now do you need a book no you can live without a book but I do have five different books and valuation you go to my website I compare them but basically let me go down the list the only one of these books that's a textbook you know it makes a textbook different from a trade book but it's priced twice as high why because you're college students and they exploit you and I hate that but if you're doing the investment valuation which is a textbook there's a trade book version of of this book which is exactly the same book and to show you how crazy Publishers are the textbook version sells for like eighty dollars and the trade book which is actually hard packed and sort of paperback sells for forty five dollars so my advice is buy the cheapest version of this book you can find and if you go to Asia you can get it for twenty two dollars all the more party this morning I was talking to somebody who said he bought my book outside a train station in a city called indoor which is in India and he said he paid a dollar and a half it's completely pirated and I said you know what whatever Rings you about because you know let's face it I'm not making money on these books in the first place so no so do whatever you can if you need a book but if you're fine without a book incidentally if you have an Apple device I have an app that I co-developed with a friend of mine and then Sunderman Dartmouth which will do an intrinsic valuation of a company so if you go to the Apple Store type in U value which is the name of the app you can download it it comes with a money back guarantee you know why it's free so if you don't like it tough keep keep it throw it away take it away but basically it does a pretty good job of an intrinsic valuation I'd put it up against any banking valuation of a company so if you want to buy a book feel free to do so incidentally during the course of the semester my my new book is coming out it's called it's a corporate life cycles and something I'd talk about during the course of this class so if it does come out I'll let you know when it's available now there's more stuff if you want almost everything for this class is on that page that's listed up there so that if you go to that link that's the central clearing point for this class you know whether it's lecture notes whether it's webcast everything is centered there so rather than go to brightspace that's where I would go for all the material for the class I every one of the lectures that I do will be converted to YouTube videos so after I get back to my office in about 20 minutes when I get the the notification from Zoom assuming it worked today and I get a recording that recording will become a YouTube video and it'll become part of a playlist so the nice thing about YouTube is you don't need bandwidth so if you're on your phone and you're on Cell rather than download and you know a video file YouTube allows you to kind of watch it and every email I sent I told you that the three so far one every day will become part of what I call the email Chronicles you know I do this everything is about me it's to protect myself because I know what you're going to say but we you know six weeks from now I'm going to say remember that email Lisa what do you mean I didn't get it no excuses yet because every email that I sent will be in the email Chronicles you can go check out now so if you're blocking emails unblock me at least for the next 15 weeks after 15 weeks I couldn't care less if you blocked me from that point on but no it's it's my device for connecting making sure that you're with the class there's a Google Calendar that I sent you the link for so you can see when the quizzes and the exams are and my blog is where I pretty much write whatever I'm so I sent you the first two data updates the last one was just three days ago the Tesla post will go up sometime this week hopefully by Wednesday no I have a Twitter feed where you can but I don't know I don't get into Twitter fights there's no tweet contest but basically whenever something is new on my website that's my my my way of connecting and if you still have time on your hands I don't see how you would they're more if you want to read more stuff there's a link again on my website which will take you to more readings on each of the topics now of course the big question you have is what's my grade going to be so here's how I think about this right I'll have to come up with the device if by the end of the class you can value just about anything and I'm going to try to give you an error name on it so if you can value most things think of that as your B territory if you can value something which is not asking for a whole lot it's a c if you can value nothing then I've failed at my job and you've failed with me okay so this is not this shouldn't be new this is the grading distribution for all Finance classes of course strategy everybody gets an a no but in finance we don't give everybody age so it's an it's a nature of the Beast which means there are going to be some of you who put in a lot of work for the class at the end of the classics I gotta be on this class but I put so much time in you know that's the way it is in terms of how you're going to get graded there is going to be a valuation project which I will start the next class talking about but here's what I'd like you to start thinking about already I want you to start thinking about a company you'd like to value and price over the course of the semester and don't think about what will be an easy company to work with pick a company that you're interested in no either because you've always read about them and you know it could be Netflix it could be palantir it could be I mean it could be it could be Alibaba it could be any company you want because that's going to be a project and they're going to be three quizzes for this class the data list each of these quizzes is worth 10 of your grade and the final exam which is worth 30 percent that's not quite time yet so please all of the quizzes and accepts will be open book open note so this is not about testing you on equations it's about applying text okay and I know that you might have to miss a quiz if you get a chance and you go to the last page of this packet it tells you all the rules that go with quizzes please read through the rules right the rules are simple which is if you go to miss a quiz you have to let me know before the quiz because I can't keep track of who's calm and say I can't give you the option take the quiz and put it in your backpack and if you do miss a quiz that 10 gets moved to what's left in the class not back but always forward so take a look at the rules because when we start next session we would start with the project and then we will be diving into the first part of the class so see you tomorrow 
uh they're looking they're talking because they're supposed to be an over-the-ear yeah just get me Regular leopard microphone and I can use it for this class foreign testing yes thank you should be good now they're saying yeah thank you okay folks I used to have a Gong for a couple of years but it freaked people out I think a couple of people had heart attacks so I'm not going to do that again but when we start class we could settle in it's it makes it easier for me because talking over 350 people is not that easy my wife said was a second grade teacher and she said the only way to get people to listen is to talk softer and softer I've tried that doesn't work with you guys and So today we're going to start with the three things on the agenda today one is I want to talk about bias how your priors and preconceptions affect your valuations so that's the start of the class test incidentally the start of the class test you I will not give out slides they're on your on the website you don't need them in front of you you can just take the test and the solutions will be on the website as well so you can go check out the web page for the class with all the links but the lecture notes you let get got the links already and we will start on those today we'll also talk about the project today I want to give you some specific but not that much I'm going to get you started on the project and finally we're going to get started on the introduction to the class that first packet of 22 Pages the first lecture note packet we want to start with until next week so you ready I said one of the things you're going to be doing is picking a company today so I want somebody to be my guinea pig who's already got a company in their mind that they'd really like to value anybody have a company in their mind that they really like to value that they've chosen already who do you want American Eagle okay now what is it about the company that makes it interesting to you I I just asked my roommate you asked your roommate for a company suggestion and you're you're very suggestible then to take uh you know but your roommate suggested it because he or she likes their genes or is it because they like the company is it because they made money on it is there a reason they picked that okay anybody else pick a company I'll come back to American Eagle yeah gas prom interesting pick really you're going to go into Russia and brave Putin and value gas prom I don't even know what the consequences are for getting the value wrong but what is it about gas prom that you find interesting why why gas problems it's Dirt Cheap can you even buy it though can you get trade on the Russian Exchange lots of practical problems there but you pick gas prom because it's been in the news obviously Russian companies collectively have collapsed in price and you want to see whether it's cheap so it's basically anybody else yes go ahead Spotify why okay so you like the company because your description of the company is a very favorable one you like the company so there is what I'm trying to say is when you pick a company it's almost never with a blank slate right you pick a company not out of the blue very few people pick companies based on what their roommates suggested so it'd be interesting to see how that works out but most of us when you pick a company you pick a company because you heard about them in CNBC Jim Cramer thinks it's a buyer or sell Warren Buffett bought the company last week today I want to talk about how before you even start your valuation many of you probably have already made up your mind on what you're going to find it's a power advice it comes from lots of different things one is you know it's it's almost subconscious if you think about where these biases from it's not like you're sitting there saying I'm going to be biased it's everything you read everything you listen to starts to affect how you think about a company anybody interested in writing Tesla foreign nobody wants to Value Tesla okay you're on the value test what do you think of Elon Musk do you like the guy or no I really you probably the last person on the face of the Earth who doesn't have an opinion on Elon Musk right you either love the guy or you hate the guy I'm glad you don't because it'll make your Tesla valuation easier because if you really really really really really dislike Elon Musk and you start to Value Tesla I'll make a prediction you know what you're going to find the Tesla is expensive if you really really love the guy and you value Tesla you're probably going to find that Tesla is cheap so when you think about what it is that drives your biases it's everything you've learned about the company read about the company think about the people running the company even your experience with product I mean you you value Uber and you're one bad Uber ride in the next three weeks God only knows where your evaluation is going after that and if you're paid to do valuation don't even talk to me about being objective you cannot be objective if somebody pays you to do a valuation you think that's not ethical this is nothing to do with ethics this has to do with the fact that if you get paid whether you like it or not it is going to affect your valuation so today I want to start with a series of examples where I'm going to ask you a value company and you tell me whether your valuations are going to be affected by what your position is so let's say you start your business so it's a startup and I ask you to value your own business with each of these questions the question I'm going to ask you is are you going to be biased up or down if you're valuing your own business is your bias going to be to come up with a high number or a low number unless you have serious self-esteem problems you'll probably say I'm a great founder this is a great business and and how would that manifest you're going to use higher growth rates and talk about a bigger Market now let's flip sites let's suppose you're a venture capitalist looking at the same business is your bias to come with the high number or a low number and tell me why what is it about Venture capitalism when you watch Shark Tank right when is Kevin already said you want a million I'll give you five he always comes back 200 000 and then he gets some licensing deal you know the O'Leary rule book so what is it about VCS that give them a benefit to come up with a lower number how does it play out in the transaction that happens I'm a VC I give you Capital right what do you give me in return a share of your company what percentage of your company it depends on what I value the company if I value it at 200 000 and I give you a hundred thousand I get 50 of the company but if you valued it a million and you claim the million I get only 10 percent so if I'm a venture capitalist I'm pushing back against every one of your assumptions you talk about high growth I talk about low growth you talk about big markets I'd say the Market's really small let's move forward let's say you you're all too young to be married but let's say you move on you get married and then you get divorced and you're valuing a business that you've started for Divorce Court so guess what's going to happen half this value is going to be paid to your soon-to-be exposed tell me do you want the is your bias to come up with a really high number a really low number you probably want to say business is worth nothing I'm useless half of nothing is nothing so here's nothing this guy called Henry ham who ran a Texas oil company he got divorced and we got divorced his wife claimed half the business so he went to it was a privately held oil company and he had he self-appraised the company and he said I'm a terrible business person I've made terrible investment decision the company's worth nothing and you can see where he was coming from let's move on let's say that I own a business and the tax guy is after me he wants 20 of the value of my business for capital gains so I hire you as an appraiser and I say be objective oh by the way I want a really low number a really high number I want a really low number and if I'm the IRS looking at the same business and I want to claim 20 off your business I want to push the number up because hey I want 20 of a higher number I know some of you are planning to be self-sided you know how equity research is structured I've got to lay the foundation before I ask this question there are two groups of people who do equity research there are sell side analysts and buy side hours what's the difference between the two groups what do cells had analysts do as opposed to buy saranis anybody want to give it a shot go ahead because the market s and who do Southside analysts work for them you work for investment Banks you work for brokerage houses you do research and then you print your research and then you try to get other people to kind of act on your research but you don't care whether they do or not because you really don't remember sell side research is a free resource that Banks offer the only way you make money then is those clients trade through you or do something through so South Side equity research is what you see when you say a Goldman Sachs analyst on CNBC in fact 95 percent of the equity research analysts you see on CNBC are Southside anodes they're the high profile lens but there are far more by side analysts than self-site analysts and where do they work have any of you gone to the Fidelity building go ahead you had your hand up or not no much more mutual funds and private Equity is a part of it but the bigger employers are people like Fidelity and T Rowe Price so they work for the fun and when they do research who uses it portfolio manages within Fidelity and low price it's not for external use it's that's why you never see them now they're not going to be out on CNBC they have no buy or sell recommendation that you see so now let's play the role of cellside equity research apps your cell side equity research analysts you're researching companies and you can put a buy or sell on it which direction do you think the buyers runs are sell-side equity research analysts going to tend to overvalue companies or undervalue companies push numbers up or push numbers down at First Sight you're saying why should there be bias right because presumably you want to put buys and sells but think through what happens when you put a buyer recommendation everybody's happy who's everybody the company is happy the Investment Bank you work for is happy because they're banking business with the company your friends are all happy because they think they can front run your buy recommendation make money so by recommendations to all roses what happens if you put a cell recommendation first the company that you put the cell recommendation on what happens to your relationship with that company it's done right in fact if you think about it as the way by sell side research is structured is you track a sector they give you 20 companies and you track these 20 companies for the rest of your life depressing thought but this is your life so if it's entertainment companies it's you know Disney and Warner and basically for the next you know 35 years you're going to be working with them you know what happens when journalists burn their sources that's it right that source is never coming back if you're a sell side analyst and you put out a cell recommendation you've just burnt the company that might be the source of any marginal information you get so you're going to think twice three times seven times nine times before you put a cell recommendation you know how this manifests itself there are nine times as many buy recommendations that sell recommendations in fact the one word Equity itself had equity research analysts don't like to say is the word self but they create all these tricky ways of telling you to sell like what this is a spectrum of recommendations you'll get from Anna Strong by week by semi-week buy really weak Buy hold tight holds no hold loose and then comes up so when an invest an equity research analyst wants to tell you to sell rather than say the word sir they'll say we've lowered the recommendation from a strong Buy to a weak buy I've never I wondered how do you weekly buy a stock right you get on your online brokerage account and instead of hitting a key decisively maybe you just tentatively do it right maybe the money goes out slower and the stocks come in slower but you're going to sell side analysts your bias is going to be to push values up something you're going to run into because when you see growth rates recommendations growth rate estimates for companies sales that I understand to overestimate the growth rate of the companies because it's the nature of the process you work at fidelity remember you work for a particular portfolio manager and he says I'd like you to Value Spotify and then he says oh by the way we own a million shares of Spotify already so he says go do your research be objective do your homework and you come back with the judgment on Spotify there are two judgments you can make right buy or sell it's undervalued which one do you think is going to make remember he already owns a million shares of Spotify which one affirms that he's a great portfolio manager the buy recommendation right because you can say a cell he's gonna you're right I asked you for your objective opinion but by the way you're fired I know it sounds absurd but when you have a portfolio managed with a strong position on a stroke he or she remember the Jack Nicholson line from that movie about you you can't handle the truth you know if you don't know go on Google search type Jack Nicholson you can't handle the truth and play it out over and over again portfolio managers claim to want to know the truth but they can't handle the truth you know Tesla used to be one of the most shorted stocks in the market now it's all the mean stocks GameStop and Bed Bath and Beyond and all the rest so let's say your portfolio is one of those people who shorted Tesla Tesla earnings report comes out this evening I've kind of held off in the valuation because I want to get that final piece to the puzzle in let's say you conclude that Tesla is actually undervalued at 140 dollars per share your portfolio mass is not going to be happy the reality is when you look at valuations you might think they look objective because they're all numbers but they're not necessarily so let's talk about Eminem M A is a very messy process so remember there are two ways a merger can happen it can be a friendly merger which is like a wedding or a hostile merger which is like a shotgun wedding okay so let's say it's a friendly merger remember there are two sides to this game right there's the acquiring company there's a Target company so let's say you are the m a banker for the acquiring company when you value the target company is your bias to push the number up or push the number down what do you have to say think about your job your job as the banker is to convince the shareholders the acquiring company that when they do this merger it's good for them right could that lead it you want to come up with a high number for the Target company or lower number which will make your shareholders feel oh this is a good merger if you come in with a low value and then you pay more than that how do you tell your shareholders it's a good merger remember you work for the acquiring company you want to make your acquiring company shareholders feel they're getting a good deal which means you got to convince them that the price that's being paid is less than the value that you're getting from the deal let's move over to the Target company bankers do you want to come in with a loan number or a high number remember it's a friendly merger how do bankers get paid before we go on do they get paid for the good advice they meet out or do they get paid based on whether the deal gets done they get paid when the deal gets done right now if you're the target company Bank you don't want to come up with a high value and show them the price is lower because then you're telling them that they're getting a bad deal because they're getting paid less so you got to convince your shareholders that they're actually getting a price above the value saying how the heck to these two sides coexist how can one side convince their shareholders that they're paying too little and the other side convinced that shareholders that they're getting paid more than they should and the answer is magical words like synergy because what does synergy allow you to do it allows you to have your cake and eat it too you can say by itself the target company is not worth what we're paying but there's Synergy in this deal which brings me to my final example your if you're looking at a hostile acquisition let's play it on you're the m a banker for the acquiring firm in a hostile acquisition here you got to be careful right hostile acquisition remember the target companies fighting you so if you come in with what you did at the friendly merger and show that the value is higher than the price you're giving ammunition to the Target company to fight you it's almost like you'd have two valuations one for external use where you say look you know you're getting fair value or even more than your value and within you say look we're getting a great deal you're saying that's two-faced it is two-faced but in a sense it kind of is part of your role as a banker Bankers are not there to give you valuation advice they're that to give you deal making advice that's really it the valuation almost becomes a tool that they use to get the deal done and if you're the target company Bankers in a hostile acquisition remember you want to give your manager's ammunition to fight off the acquisition so you're going to come so it's almost a reverse of what you saw in the previous case we convince you know your shareholders look this too lower price you can't take it foreign this is something we're going to talk about today the number gets set first the valuation follows and you can see why so one thing I would like you to do you have to do this sorry about this one thing I'd like you to do right now as you pick your companies is actually think about what your priors are in the company in statistics there's a branch of Statistics called Bayesian statistics have you heard of this Invasion statistics before you do a study or run a test you're supposed to State your priorities you're supposed to tell the word I'm going to do this research and what the relationship is between how many beers you drink and what your GPA is and by the way before I even do the research this is what I expect to find you think that's absurdy I haven't done the study yet and then you do the study and you come up with the results and you show both you show your priors and what you discovered in the study you know why you do that because people consuming the study then can say hey this person was bias going and they found results that confirmed their bias I'm going to trust the conclusions last and we've gone through three years of covet studies right don't you wish that people had priors on these studies where they said look before we tell you the effects of vaccines on infections we think that there is no relationship a strong relationship and then they show you the study this notion of science is objective is nonsensical when you think about how statistical studies are done there's bias at every state in the process and we need to be open about it so here's what your project is you're going to pick a company don't have to wait till this weekend don't have to ask other people so if you already have something floating around start latching on you can change your mind three weeks later with your company but it's good to get started with the company so in terms of the project here's what you're going to do you're first going to create a group and the group and the company Choice can happen at the same time so it's designed to be a group project at the minimum I'd like to have at least four people in the group you need a critical mass and I'd like to cap the group at about seven or eight because you're going to get logistical issues and each of you is going to pick a company so let me be very clear if you have a group of four there'll be four companies in your group if a group of seven there'll be seven companies in your group now the actual final project is not due till May 8th if you check your calendar that's the very last day of class at 5 pm but I'm going to put a prod to get you working at least part way Midway through the semester on March 31st I'm going to give you a one-time deal if you value a company and you want me to give feedback I won't give grades so basically you say well I value Tesla what do you think about these numbers if March 31st it's completely optional so if you feel so comfortable that you can start on May 7th and finish by may all the more power to you but if you feel that that feedback will be useful on March 31st you turn in your valuation to be the Excel spreadsheet that contains your valuation and it's only for feedback so here's what the project involves because I said each of you is going to pick a company you can pick any company you want but I'm going to you know put in some group-wide constraints at least one of your companies has to be a money losing company don't worry there's lots of money losing companies you don't have to look very far you can take pelleton you can take Uber but even some established companies at least one of your companies needs to be money losing at least one of your companies has to have high growth potential in Revenue so you can have them you know it can be it's not an earning because you can have high earnings growth without much growth in the company so it's got to be Revenue at least one of your companies has to be a non-us company and if you want to pick a non-us company which has a listing in the US I'm okay with that so if you want to pick Alibaba or Baidu I'll count that as a non-us company at least one of your companies will be a service company and guess what that's an easy slam dunk because 70 of companies or service companies and software companies basically a lot of companies which I would put into service I don't want five manufacturing companies basically in the group I wanted to deal with the fact that for some companies investment takes a form of not land in building and Equipment factories but r d and opening new stores and things that you don't fit it again so across the group these constraints have to be met remember a company can meet more than one constraint right you can be a money losing company with high Revenue growth which means you mean and if you pick a money losing High Revenue Growth Company in India you got three of the constraints met in fact one of the ways you can play this out is you know there'll be people who try to join your group and if you want towards the end you can extract the price you can say okay you want to join the group you got to pick a money losing high growth Emerging Market Service Company and get them to do the whole thing right but that's just a suggestion don't take that as a rule you will be primarily responsible for your company says what's the point of this group there's relatively little group of because I know you guys don't like each other that much anymore the advantage of a group is you can bounce ideas off there might be if you have two companies in the same sector you might decide to do some common research but this is more individual than group work there will be one final group report and one final grade for the entire group and please please don't come in and say I did all the work I should get the a they should get B's it doesn't work that way I can't split the grade so you have an incentive to make sure other people in your group are kind of keeping up why because I can't do it I mean 350 people in the class I can't keep track of who's doing so you have to have your internal mechanisms for keeping keeping people on track and if you have if you want any ideas I'll suggest watching The Godfather especially the part where the horse's head is on the pillow so you can you can find ways I'm sure or better still watch that movie where um the dentist drilling a guy's mouth with you know I forget Marathon Man I think no so lots of ways you can find you know to to to get people to behave but I don't I prefer not to be involved in any of them you're going to value your company so basically once you pick your company and it meets a constraint you're going to do what's called an intrinsic valuation which is just a fancy reason you're going to value your company as a business in this class that's going to take the form of a discounted cash flow model but essentially you have to wrestle with the business that is the part that will come to you on March 31st the discounted cash flow evaluation that's really about 70 percent of the project is doing that entrance evaluation after you've done that in the second part of the class remember I talked about pricing being different from valuation I'm going to ask you to price your company so you can actually you know cross the word out values really price your company relative to other companies in the group so if your value if you're looking at a software company and say given how other software companies are being priced what's the pricing it attached for the moment you might be mystified as to why that would be different from your intrinsic valuation but it will I'm also going to ask you to price your company relative to the entire Market because during the course this semester the Market's going to go up it's going to go down and you have to adjust for that in your price so by the time you get to step four you'll have an intrinsic valuation for your company you'll have a pricing of your company against the sector pricing against the market and for some of you I will give you an added way of attaching a number to your company especially if it's a distressed company or if it's a young Healthcare company we use option pricing the bottom line is you're going to have four different numbers for your company you think so what because the last phase I'm going to ask you to tell me what the you'll buy or sell the stock no strong buys no semi-strong buys no weak buys buy or sell and I'll let some of you chicken out you know what the chicken out is I'll hold which basically means I can't make up my mind I would give you that room but I'm going to push you towards making a judgment you're already going to say what if my intrinsic valuation tells me to buy and my pricing tells me to sell remember the numbers can be different you get to decide there's no right answer I'm going to ask you which of those numbers we have more faith in okay so in the very last session I'm going to gather your recommendation so this mechanism I'm going to have get all your recommendations together you're going to see the percent of the companies that come out as buys the person may come out of cells with how many came out is undervalued how many Kmart is overvalued do not compare what you're coming up with every class that I've taught going back 30 years so you can see how this is so from the peak of the.com Boom to 2008 let's see where you fall in that largest pattern so this is actually the time frame so if you're wondering what the it's kind of confusing because as I said my MBA class starts next week and they have two sessions less so I've listed out by session what you should where you should be on the project this is what I'm going to prod you with every Thursday remember I said I'll send you an email this timeline is what I'm going to use say this is where you should be so right now you're in the in the Mellow phase the first three sessions you're still picking companies picking the group the sooner you can pick a company the sooner you can start doing the raw data collection and I'll send you suggestions on how to do it but that's basically the big project it'll run through the class it's going to be what 40 of your grade and of course the remaining 60 will come from your quizzes and exams okay any questions on the project you look shell shocked it's not that bad if your reaction is I don't think I can do it trust me you will you've never taken Finance not a problem you will you will be able to do it that's my job to make sure you have the tools to do it which brings me to the start of the lecture so today I want to talk about valuation and I told you last session now I asked you what your motive was for taking this class why are you taking this class and I think it it befits this process for me to tell you why I do valuation when I first started teaching evaluation I made the mistake of assuming that everybody else was as interested in valuation as I was terrible mistake because I've discovered that most people don't believe in valuation including most people who do valuation for a living you think but they do it every day they do it because it's their job they do it because they get paid but if you ask them why is Tesla trading at 140 their answer is because that's what people think it's worth if that's what I thought I wouldn't be teaching this class so I'm going to start by telling you why I do valuation I do valuation to fight the lemming in me you've heard of lemmings Lemmings became famous or inFAMOUS in the 1950s when National Geographic or Disney people are not sure which one did this fill the most amazing set thousands of big ugly rat-like creatures that's what lemmings look like so don't glamorize they're not cute little bunnies ran right off a cliff into an ocean and committed Collective suicide and ever since one of the big questions I mean what drives him off the cliff I don't know the answer to the question but let's do some virtual imagery you can see why the first lemming did it right he was going too fast he slid right off the edge falls into the ocean incidentally these guys can't swim that kind of seals the deal dead second guy too close the first guy also off the cliff into the ocean also dead but I'd like you to put yourself in the shoes of the very last lemming in the group I know lemming Stone by shoes but can I hang in there with the analogy anyway you're running as fast as you can towards a cliff you've seen your entire tribe disappear off the cliff you're with me so far I would think you'd have second thoughts about what you were just planning to do your left brain right brain whatever partner actually says stop stop and then you hear this voice in the back of your head and you know what to say they must know something that you don't remember those seven words the seven most deadly words in investing in valuation they must know something that you don't you know when you hear you Value stock it's a stock that's gone from ten dollars let's say you value tests let it speak which I did but two years ago November of 2021. and you're three months ago the stock was worth a trillion dollars in terms of market cap was trading at thirteen hundred dollars everybody was on the bandwagon I value the stock and I bet every assumption to I mean it's almost like every lever is at Full Throttle and I came up with 550 and I said I give up I can't get about this but before I gave up I heard this voice in the back of my head you know what he was saying right they must know something that you don't speaks in a monotone don't ask me why but we know those words magical things start to happen to your valuation your growth rates go up your discount rates go down your cash flows get bigger the number starts to creep up towards what everybody else is paying it's human nature don't fight it so when you think about valuing a company you're going to find this push towards moving towards where everybody else is so when everybody's in a good mood about a company you're going to push your value up and if everybody's selling you're going to push your value down I know that that urge is going to hit me you know why I do valuation because I want to fight that urge in fact I divide the whole world of investors into three groups of lemaks the first group I call proud Lemmings I'm a lemming and I'm proud to be a lemon they call themselves momentum investors but you know what they do right what do momentum investors do they look for a crowd they join and you're buying I'm buying two why are you buying I don't care I can't even imagine going around shaking people saying I'm a momentum investor might as well I'm a lemming and I'm proud to be a lemon the second group of lemmings I call Yogi Bear that means nobody ever seen the Yogi Bear cartoons or read the comic books way back in time but Yogi Bear lived I think it's Yellowstone Park he was actually a bear it's not some you know synonym for something else he was actually a bear but he was smarter than the average bear think they are they think they're smarter than the average living here's what they want to do they want to run with the crowd till the very edge of the cliff and at the last moment we are away it's great trying to get all the upside of momentum but you'd sell Tesla at 1250 when everybody else is a peak you'd buy it back at a hundred think how rich you could be admit it you're feeling a little tempted right you say I'm going to stern I got into this stuff program I'm learning all of this stuff I'm smart but the average lemming you might be I'm not you know what I cannot tell I cannot tell where the cliff is coming I like that Stanley drucken Miller Port where he said I thought it was on the board in the top of the egg when in fact I was at the bottom of the night for those of you don't track baseball you have no idea what this is but bottom of the night the game is over if you think there are three Innings left when in fact the game's going to be over you're like the Dallas Cowboys coach I think who forgets to keep time oh my God you're seven points down you have 25 so you got to do something but I guess he forgot that I don't know where the cliff is coming I cannot be a proud lemming I'm not smarter than the average lemming if you ask me to describe myself that's me a lemming with the life vest that's all I can aspire to be you know what valuation does it give me a life verse something else to hold on to where even if everybody else changes their mind I can say look I can still collect the cash flows I don't do valuation to make myself rational it's an impossible Quest you know why because I'm a human being human beings are incapable of being rational I do valuation because it slows the process down for me it gives my rational side a chance to mount an argument nine times out of ten I'm going to steamroll and do whatever I want to do but maybe that one time out of ten when I listen to it I'll do the right thing so my mission for this class is way low it's not to make your rational Supreme investors it's to give your rational side enough tools enough ammunition to mount an argument and perhaps you will be able to listen to it so what I'd like to talk about are some very broadly held misconceptions about valuation these are held by people who do valuation for a living let's dispel these myths here's the first one a good valuation is an objective search for the truth you know what feeds into this you sit in front of computers with big Excel models you start entering numbers and afterwards look I'm being objective I'm working only with numbers that's a misconception here's the reality there are no objective valuations we started this class with bias bias permeates valuations whether you like it or not I'll give you a personal example in fact two personal examples I have valued Microsoft every year since 1986 and between 1986 and 2014 every time I valued Microsoft I found the company to be overvalued you name the price was of about two dollars overvalued five too much ten dollars don't buy it strange right one of the great success stories of U.S Equity markets in the 20th century I wouldn't have bought it at any step of the process between 1986 and 2014. you're saying what happened in 2014 I'll come back and talk about that and I could give you access to every one of those valuations I think my very first one was on a Lotus spreadsheet shows you how old that because 1986 wasn't there in public and you could dig through the numbers looking for Clues but if you really want to know why I found Microsoft to be overvalued all you need to do is make that trip all the way up to the ninth floor to my office you walk and here's what you're going to see you're going to see my MacBook Pro to the left you're going to see an Apple display in front of me my iPhone sitting in a cradle right next to my and my iPad on the other side because I like to watch movies while I work and incidentally but I don't want anybody to you know to be hearing what I'm watching I put in my airpods in a long-winded way I'm saying I'm an I'm an Apple user I've been an Apple user since 1981. in fact in my office if you don't believe me you can come and check it out I have a Mac 128k you know the Mac 128k was that was the very first Mac which came without a hard drive it came with the disc so to me Microsoft has always been the Darth Vader of Technology If You're a Star Wars fan let me be specific I'm not talking Anakin Skywalker cute little boy Darth Vader I'm talking dog episodes four five and six the guy in Black never takes a shower I think speaks in that strange voice I have lots of bad thoughts about Bill Gates they have nothing to do with vaccines incidentally but every time I sat down to Value Microsoft all that stuff would come bubbling up to the surface because in valuation you constantly come to Forks in the road high growth or low growth high risk or low risk with Microsoft is a no-brainer who buy this rotten product low growth yo one virus away from blowing up high risk and by the time I made my choices Microsoft always came out as over bed you know what my recognition of that was I am far too biased to Value Microsoft because I hate the company too much but I'm also far too biased to Value another company that I just mentioned right which is because I love the company too much if you've been on my blog I valued Apple every year since 2009. take a look at my very first valuation of Apple I think I spent half the post telling people don't trust me don't trust me I love this company too much and that's all I can do I can't say look I'm being objective I'm going to set that to the side and I've discovered that if you're open about your biases it actually cleans up the process a little bit I'm still biased when I value Apple but I found it overvalued at regular intervals but the first step was a confession that I was not being objective that's why I said write down what you think about your company before you do the valuation at the end of the class maybe we'll do a little correlation Matrix where I ask you did you think your company is going to be undervalued then we'll see whether you I will wager you're going to see a high correlation between what you thought you'd find in the company and what you actually find but let me add to the proposition I said money muddies up the process if you get paid to do evaluation and you tell how much you get paid and who pays you I'll tell you which direction the bias is and how much the biases I'll give you an example a company called Lin cable 30 years ago it was a small cable company and a t had this option to buy 51 of Lin cable at an appraised value that's the way the contract was actually written lit cable is actually a publicly traded company but the contract was written in terms of an appraised right so the time for the option to be exercised comes about a t goes out and hires Morgan Stanley so you guys are going to be more instantly your job is to Value Lin cable so I can buy 51 of it so you work for the buyer lint cable hires Lehman Brothers sorry to do this to you guys but think of yourself as pre-bankrupt Lehman Brothers and your job is to assess the value of the same 51 so Lynn can sell it so you work for the seller you work for the buyer one Investment Bank came back with a hundred and five dollars per share the other came back with a hundred and fifty five dollars permission I want you to guess which side came back with a 105 dollars and which one came back with the 155 anybody want to take a wild guess yeah uh 405 on this side and Morgan Stanley came back with a 105 because your job is to work for the buyer you come in with the low ball number and of course there'll be a 500 page valuation report to back it up to make it look like it's objective and you came back with the 155 because your job is to come into the high number in fact the difference was so large they called in a third investment banker why settle for two fees when you can have three I guess and they call in this outfit called washestine perella I'm going to say some terrible things about these guys but I mean every word of it these guys brought down the practice evaluation about six notches in their existence on the face of the South they could value 20 bill in a brown paper bag as I said but if your wasistine pearly right in the middle right here right you got 105 and 155 you might have to work with Morgan Stanley Lehman in the future you don't want to piss off either side too much so what's the safest place for you to be 130 right they came back with 127 dollars at 53 cents I'm going to give you some advice and valuation if you're ever asked to Value something never ever ever ever come back with a nice round number don't tell me the Target price is forty dollars per share tell me it's 38 dollars and 57 cents that second decimal point will create the illusion that you actually know more than you do when in doubt add decimals it's intimidation factor is huge 15 decimals this guy must know everything I'm not asking many questions in most valuations when people get paid you can tell which direction is going to come this is why legal valuation I I tell people especially I mean I don't do expert witness work when they call me can you do expert witness work I said look courts are where valuation first principles go to die why because in a court what's your job it's to provide ammunition for your side and it's you're saying but wouldn't it be unethical you know what human beings are capable of deluding themselves at their objective no matter how biased they are so as I said we need to do some Bayesian valuation we need to be more open about our biases it doesn't make evaluations Less in fact I think we'll get a better valuations if everybody said look I have a bias I'm going to tell you what the bias is let's move on to the second misconception if I do a good valuation I'm going to get the right answer when does this get started when you were five you went off to kindergarten the teacher put two plus three in front of you you've said five good good you got the answer right any other answer you got the wrong answer you must have done something wrong and this gets drummed into you all the way through and if you're a numbers person and you go on for a numbers degree none of you are doing this but if you become an engineer guess what they'll be mbas next week that I would see who are recovering Engineers recovering actuaries recovering accountants who've had this drummed into them if you do things right you will get the right answer and if you got the wrong answer you must have done something wrong that's a misconception here's the truth there are no precise valuations why because you don't know what the future will deliver I mean imagine building a hotel again in 2019 and you do everything right what did you not foresee coveted 2020 and if you'd foreseen it into it I you have some explaining to do I probably want to pull you up and say how the heck did you know maybe you relieved the damn thing yeah but I'm going to say something that's going to sound contradictory people think if they get a valuation that's imprecise there's a bigger range on it that somehow they've done things wrong in fact I'm going to argue that the payoff to doing valuation this is one of the questions asked you at the start of the first session the payoff to doing valuation is greatest when you feel most uncertain about the numbers I'll give you an example about uh 2019 March one week in March of 2019 two companies went public they're both companies whose name started with an L and the both companies you're probably familiar with one was a company called Lyft remember Lyft got to the market before Uber it was the first ride-sharing company to go public so what were the characteristics of left big money losing company lots of potential business model still in flux the second company was a company called Levi Strauss I think Levi starts with public only in 2019 they used to be a public company last century they were taken private they've been around 150 years they were going back public again so I'm going to ask you two questions Levi Strauss and Lyft you try to Value both come which of these two companies is going to be easier to value why because you know exactly how they make the money right it's probably on your back if you're wearing Levi's jeans they still make 70 money from the genes you know the business model you know the geographies you know the company a lot of history a lot of crutches lift is going to be more difficult why because you're trying to make a judgment on whether that potential payoff is money whether they can convert themselves into a money-making company you're going to make a lot of judgments so when you get your final value for Lift it's going to be much I mean the way think about uncertainty is not that you can't value a company but it comes with a bigger range so you think this is good I'm going to Value Levi's trust because I get a more precise valuation but remember the way you make money on a stock is not based on how precise your evaluation of a company is but how precise your valuation is relative to other people valuing exactly the same company so Levi's travels is easy for you to Value right because it is a business model it's a lot of history you can plug it into a spreadsheet you think you're special everybody has exactly the same ammunition guess what anybody can value Levi Stars I mean you know you can you can get a 10 year old you give me enough candy I can treat the 10 year old enough valuation to be able to Value Labor's trash you can use my app to Value laborers does a pretty good job there is no differential Advantage you bring to the table in contrast with Lyft you know what most people end up doing and I'm going to talk about in the context of young companies they give up we're going to talk about VCS VCS don't value companies they price them you know why they say there's too much uncertainty they give up at least you're trying and because you're trying you're going to have an advantage of a people or not so if you're thinking about a complete value I'm going to give you some advice if you want an interesting company go where it's darkest this is not a horror movie suggestion because that's a terrible suggestion you go down to the chainsaw guy terrible things will happen to you go where it's darkest go into sectors where there's lots of uncertainty the markets where there's lots of uncertainty because that's where the payoff to trying to do your best no I mean I when I whenever I teach this class especially for the mbas Midway through the semester I'll get somebody you know usually a recovering engineer come in it's done evaluation put the valuation on my desk and he said I'm done with my valuation can you tell me whether I got the right answer I push the valuation back across the desk and I make a confession look I don't know what the right answer is that you can see their faith in the system start to crack you're teaching this class you don't know what the right value for the company is so can you the right value for every company why would I be teaching this class I'd own an island in Hawaii with a castle on top of it but at that stage you can see this group splintering one half cannot deal with the fact that there is no right answer you know what happens then they become fixed income it's so much more comforting sitting there with a bond right the maturity is given the coupon is given you don't have to worry about default risk this Revenue growth margin wrist step that's healthy gold value bonds you I I think they're incredibly boring but maybe you like boring maybe the rest of your life is so exciting that this is the part that you want to be boring the other half says this is kind of fun if you don't know what the right answer is I can never ever conclusively be wrong think about it some of the great things about equities I value a company I ask you to buy the company five years and you've lost half your money come say why do you ask me to buy the company you know what my response is not a long enough time Horizon company goes bankrupt the system got in the way that Lehman by recommendation I put out in 2006. think of how good are we looking today Lehman just hadn't gone under Precision is not what you're looking for you're looking for accuracy sounds like I'm playing with words right Precision means I have a model that delivers the same number over and over again even if it's the wrong number you can be precisely wrong every single time that's what accountants want they want precisely wrong numbers because you get the same answer every time accuracy means you're trying to get the right number even if it means that you're off by more that's the end game evaluations which brings me a third and last misconception if I make my model bigger it's going to get better and this is such an easy trap to fall into it's so easy to build big models now right I'll give away how old I am by telling you what I use for my first valuation was 1981 or 1980 middle of my MBA program I sat down to Value company you know what the first thing I had to do is I had to write to the company I actually took my hand pen wrote to the company can you send me an annual report usually want to go online it's downloaded there was no online two weeks later give the company credit I got it in the mail so I've been annual report to do my valuation here's what I used I used to Ledger sheet you guys ever seen a ledger sheet just a blank sheet of paper with columns drawn in huge saving for me because I could never get the line straight but it's a blank sheet of paper and I used to pencil I learned very early don't use a pen because if you screw up you're going to be scratching things out and a calculator not a slide rule I'm not that old but a calculator when you do a valuation on a ledger sheet with a pencil and a calculator you're not going to have a whole lot of detail there because every cell has to be calculated by you and written in it's not copy and paste right who's going to be pasting it you with a pencil and a calculator your valuations of parsimonious because you had no choice today with Excel spreadsheets a little bit bigger and bigger and bigger models inputs come in they never leave and God help you if there's a team in the basement of your company building an in-house valuation model just gets bigger and more inflated over time 15 worksheets 500 inputs to Value one company what do they get that's building models and then they send it up to your desk from this point on value companies using our in-house model two things happen to these markets one is what I call input fatigue I'll describe what input fatigue feels like and some of you might have worked as interns in Investment Bank might have felt this it usually hits you at on a Saturday night at about 10 pm I'll tell you where you are you're still at your desk looking at you and here's what happens you're getting ready to shut things down finally after a long week you're ready to go home your managing director who's a jerk comes in throws an annual report on your desk and say I want this company valued first thing tomorrow morning why he wants to see how much you really want this job initially your response is to exercise your option to abandon be satisfying when you exercise it usually take the form of picking up the annual report throwing it in your managing director's face so you do it yourself that's a deeply satisfying moment as it leaves your hand and everything after that is downhill you think about it for a moment but then you remember you know you want a job you get need to get paid so you sit down with your in-house model which has 85 inputs to Value one company and you start entering it puts me really carefully more Point each input at a time you get to the 15th then put in the clock strikes midnight you're not Cinderella you wish you were the pumpkin outside Fairy Godmother maybe that would help you looked under 70 more inputs to go your stomach drops you look at the 16th input says what was the inventory five years ago now part of you wants to go look it up it's too exhausted to get out of the chair the other part of your prompts enter a random number let's move on it's amazing how the random numbers replace actually and when the final output comes out it all swims together right the input you thought hours about the input you just made up they all look alike I've told people look you have a lot of random numbers and evaluation create more detail in your output why do you think investment banks have 500 line items it's not because they know more about the company because then they can hide some really crappy inputs because you have a checking it's input fatigue the second is the power shifts with these more you know what I mean by that initially you think you're running the mod but somewhere along the way it looks like the model has started running you and now with chat GPT who knows it might actually be running you it asks you for it puts you enter the inputs say go get me a cup of coffee run very quickly you want to piss off the model it might stop working the model becomes a black box and here's how it will manifest itself when you value the company here's how you're just going to describe your valuation the model value the company at whenever you see those words in a report you know what the analyst is saying right don't blame me I just work for the model I'm going to encourage you to use the spreadsheets I've already built to do your valuations not because I don't trust you on Excel but I don't want this to become an Excel class my models are pretty straightforward they're flexible you can adapt them you can modify them on one condition here are the words I don't want to see in your final report that the modern model value the company at no no no no no no no you can download my model but then take ownership adapt it if you want model Stone value companies you and I do which brings me to my final point if you use elaborate valuation mods you think you're getting a better valuation right look more inputs there are some really simple assets you can mangle with complex valuation marks I'll give you my favorite example it's on every company's valency it should be the easiest of all assets to add what am I talking about what's in every company's balance sheet and she said that's I know exactly what that's what cash right you'd be amazed how many emails I get every week from people claiming to have built a better model to Value cash so here's how the email will start Professor deodorant it's amazing what Microsoft spell check does to your name but if you're not careful deodorant please I smell good it could be a lot worse right I've spent the last six months of my life building this model to Value cash which my responsible for an empty life you must have could you please take a look at the attached spreadsheet and tell me whether I've done a good job I don't even look at the spreadsheet I emailed them back it's actually and I've saved this is one of those texts you can send with the button it says have you tried counting it it tends to work with cash because here's what happens when you build elaborate models to Value cash you take the cash and you project the income from the cash right right now how much are you making on cash how about no you are in a better position than we were right now we're making about 4.8 so if you're making zero on your cash you better need to move it from wherever it is now but a year ago was close to zero percent four point eight percent you project the income on the cache and then you remember all your class you've done learned about cost of equity and cost of capital you open up your book and you let's say Google 100 billion in cash making 4.8 then you estimate a cost to capital for Google well the business school is paying off big time and you come up with a 10 costic app for Google and then your discount the 4.8 percent guaranteed income you're making on the cash you got 10 percent cost to Capital you know what's going to happen to 100 million cash it's going to become 81 billion you wiped out that's amazing you just wiped out 19 billion well all he did was he discounted guaranteed cash flows at a risk adjusted discount rate why go on looking for trouble so when you have a company start I mean it's a in the physical sciences called the principle of parsimony it's also called Occam's razor when you're trying to explain something start with the simplest explanation before you make yourself Einstein I'm going to encourage you to think with what's the least I can do you're going to add detail to your valuations I'm going to push and say are you bringing in something with the detail because the urge to add detail is always going to be there it's like are you bringing something so if you're valuing Peloton you want to break the revenues down to subscription revenues and do fitness equipment revenues all the more poverty but if you do that you better have something you're bringing to those estimates that allows you to differentiate between the two less is more and it's something you're going to see me repeat over and over again partly because I think it'll make your valuations better so let me bring the three things I've talked about bias uncertainty complexity I call this the Bermuda Triangle evaluation you heard of the Bermuda Triangle this is a mythical area I think I hope because I go across the Atlantic once in a while where if you go to the triangle you disappear ships and planes the Bermuda Triangle evaluation is where Good Sense goes to disappear the three biggest enemies of good valuation are not that you can't estimate betas and costs of capital it's because you're getting more down and guess what people think we move from bad times to Good Times in terms of valuation do you think bias is less now than it was 30 years ago I don't think you still get paid uncertainty is actually greater because one of the flip sides of disruption is businesses that we thought were predictable and you could make up the estimates have become unpredictable and it's so much easier to make your models complex that's part of the reason why I think valuations have actually become less qualitatively good than they used to be because the Bermuda Triangle is taking off so I'm going to set the table for this class you hear people say there are hundreds of ways to Value companies that's an absolute lie there are only three ways you can put a number on an asset one is what I'm going to call intrinsic valuation fancy word for the valuable business is a function the cash flows can generate as a business adjusted for the risk I discounted cash flow model might be the vehicle you used for that the second way you could put a number on something is by looking around other people are paying for similar things you guys ever use StubHub or SeatGeek you know how do you decide how much you pay look at what people are charging you look at a section and say wait you know what I want to be in that section at Yankee Stadium that no I'm going to go in fact I think SeatGeek is the one that actually gives ranks your deals from best deal to worst deals there must be a guy that do no they just compare prices in a section and say this is the lowest price it's the highest price that's pricey and the third way to put a number in an asset this is where you might need some new ammunition is when your cash flows are contingent and something happened we use an option pricing order every valuation so every every time you see somebody put a number on something first thing to ask is which of these three buckets is it going to go into so let's talk a little bit about whatever these approaches what the underlying assumption is when you use these approaches and this is the basis for all valuation approaches whether you're doing intrinsic valuation or pricing or even option pricing you're assuming that markets make mistakes I'm often asked at the start of these classes I'm surprised nobody's asked me yet do I think markets are efficient which my response is if I thought markets were efficient why would I be teaching this class because if we lived in an efficient market what's the right value for Tesla let's open up the newspaper or go online what's the price now that becomes your best test in an efficient market we're not assuming that markets don't make mistakes we just can't find those mistakes the best estimate of value is the price so already when you enter valuation you're making an assumption that markets can make mistakes right and one of the things I'm going to elaborate on is what types of mistakes your assuming markets make because which approach you use will be determined by how you think markets make mistakes maybe they make mistakes in individual companies but not at the market level and they correct those mistakes over time maybe they're right on so basically you can have combinations of things drive but you have to be explicit about where markets make mistakes so let's start this process by looking at the most common way of doing intrinsic valuation which is to do discounted cash flow Backpage what is discarded cash flow valuation I don't know when you took your first finance class but remember that first session for the class it used to be that we made you buy a financial calculator before you took the class you know why we did that right teach you the meaning of sunk cost because then you showed up in the class I don't like this class and you can drop the class by the way the bookstore won't take back the calculator but you've learned a very important lesson about Finance with the sun cost but during the course of that class you start wearing out that one button on the calculator which one I'm talking about that's the PV button it's now kind of shifted on elsewhere but ninety percent of Finance is present value in discounted cash flow valuation is an extension of that idea the value of a business or an asset is the present value of the expected cash flows on the pass and when you do discounted cash flow valuation whether you like it or not you're implicitly assuming that there is such a thing as intrinsic value I you know I sometimes get on the CNBC show after the markets and with your trip for Traders I love the show because these guys are open about the fact that a complete contempt for value he said we're traders who the heck cares with it there's no such thing as that it's demand and Supply its price and if you believe that then intrinsic valuation doesn't make sense I I I think it's akin to the search for the Holy Grail have you seen the Indiana Jones movie right you know people have been searching for the Holy Grail for hundreds of years maybe in thousands of years they've never found it but they keep trying and cry an intrinsic valuation you'll never get to see intrinsic value but you keep trying you keep the faith and if you break down discounted cash flow models no matter how complex they are you're going to see a life for the asset right to get the value now so you can say that's the last 10 years 15 years 50 years you've got to have cash flows over that life and a discount rate that reflects the riskiness of the cash flows and if you do discounted cash flow evaluation are you making assumptions about markets absolutely first you're assuming that markets make mistakes that's an easy one because even Believers in efficient markets will accept markets make mistakes second you're assuming you can find those mistakes with your discounted cash flow models right and there you're in Dangerous Ground because the history of people who claim to find market mistakes is not that good remind me again how much the average active portfolio manager beats the market by each year all these private Equity Funds head should it's a trick question it's minus 1.5 it's the strangest profession the analogy I would offer it's like starting a plumbing business called floods are us and here's what you do you have a leak in your house you call me and I leave a flood and insist that you pay me you would never do that right but that's what active investors pay me for doing what delivering one percent less than anything funny scratching into what to do what but hopes brings Eternal right you want to invest in Citadel admitted you saw the 16 billion those guys made they say you know I want to give my money to settled but in this kind of cash flow valuation you're making an assumption you can find those mistakes so markets make mistakes you can find those mistakes but there's a third assumption you need for you to actually make money so let's say let's name the mistake let's say Tesla should really be at 200 you've done your valuation you'd think that's a fair value it's trading at 140. to go buy a million shares of Tesla at 140. why a million I want to give you some substance in your investment because you buy one chair you're not going to feel it that much by a million shares for you to make money on this investment what's the third leg what has to happen forget about the people 140 has got to move to 200 whether it's other people or whether it's a mystical being that comes in and says adjust the price the 140 you see what we all assume we eventually we all believe in market efficiency the only question is when markets become efficient in the self-serving world we live in you know when they become efficient right after we take a big position in a stock I'm sorry I didn't mind so we are making assumptions about how markets make mistake so let's think about what the advantages are of intrinsic valuation and we'll start thinking about why everybody might not want to use it when you talk about it the first Advantage is it puts into practice with Warren Buffett often says about his Investments Warren Buffett says he doesn't buy shares in a company he buys a piece of a business intrinsic valuation puts that into practice look rather look we have to understand the business the cash flows so that's the first Advantage is you are in fact thinking about buying businesses and it forced you to think about the underlying economics of the business will it work will it not is it a good company a Bad Company and if you buy into the assumption that you are in fact getting cash flows in return for what you're paying you might say I don't care if the market never agrees with me I'll just collect the cash flows and hold on to the car that's what Buffett has actually said is look I don't need the market to come around to my point of view I just collect the cash flows that takes a lot of current most portfolio managers can't do that because you're going to have to cash out what are the disadvantages it is more work than pricing it does require that you get your hands around cash flows it does require that you make your best estimates and there's one final problem which is when you do an intrinsic valuation you find company a to be overvalued Company B to be overvalued company C it is entirely possible that every company that you look at in a sector is overvalued do you think so what hey you're a sales ad equity research analyst what's your job to put out enough buy recommendation that clients get interested right you're a portfolio manager and you've got to be Equity neutral you got to be able to buy companies even if everything is overvalued most people don't use intrinsic valuation investing because their jobs don't allowed you need a long time Horizon to win and they don't have the timer rights so as you think about this kind of cash flow evaluation think about both the pluses and minuses not right for everybody for some people it might be and that's why I said at the end of the class I'm going to give you a choice after you've done a DC evaluation of your company your pricing I'm going to ask you which one are you going to go but there's no right answer it depends on how you think markets make mistakes and correct their mistakes so I will see you next Monday 
thank you yesterday questions thank you foreign a lot of stuff so that's very business you can either value equity in the business you can value a whole different what do you think right yeah yeah thank you the better now I'm going to stay close to this Podium then because this mic is obviously working so today's session I hate being my recording but I have no choice today's my long day is all these are complicated pieces I'm not sure what to do and so to understand the contracts I'm going to stay a little far away from that other feedback to understand the chronograph could be the difference between value the value equity in a business what do you think about buying that house or an apartment in the U.S anybody planning to buy an apartment wealthy enough to do that right now [Music] two million dollars [Music] and unless now it's okay and unless you're a drug dealer what do you have to do to buy the apartment you got to borrow the money right so let's say you borrowed 80 which is actually Low by U.S standards let's think about what you have right after you buy the apartment so you borrowed one no 800 000 you bought a million dollar apartment if I ask you what the value of your apartment is what's your answer three million dollars you just bought it it's going to change tomorrow if I ask you how much Equity you have in this apartment what's your answer going to be 200 000. who cares let's say tomorrow the apartment drops in value from a million dollars to nine hundred thousand you still owe the 800 000 you can't go to the bank and say guys the house went down and price could you lower the loan as well it doesn't work that way your Equity went from 200 000 to 100 000. the value of the apartment drops to 800 000 now you're looking at Equity worth nothing and if the house keeps dropping soon your Equity is underwater and you essentially have negative equity what I'm trying to draw a contrast between the value of a business and the value of the equity in the same business and we start over the proposition that should be pretty obvious you can have a valuable business where Equity is worth nothing under what conditions the business goes out and borrows way too much money that can happen one of the first decisions you got to make when you sit down to do valuation is you have to decide whether you're valuing the business or with the valuing equity because everything you do in valuation is going to be driven by that choice so I'm going to give you the contrast and I'll come back and flesh this out a little bit more if you're valuing the equity in a business the way you do valuation is you look at the cash flows you get as an equity investor which are cash flows left over after interest payments debt payments that's your cash flow equity and you discount them back at a rate of return you need to make as an equity investor based on the risk of them it's called the cost of equity cash flows to equity discounted the cost of equity gives you value equity there's another way you can do evaluation which is rather than valuing the equity in the business you can value the entire business what does that mean remember there are two places you went to get the funds to run this business one is from Equity investors and the other was from Banks or bondholders who lent you the money they both provided capital Equity investors get with the residual cash flow dividends whatever's left over what do banks and lenders get as cash flows from the business interest payments and principal payment when it comes to you collectively you both collect cash flows the only difference is what the types of cash flows are lenders get contractually committed cash flows you get residual cash flows but what if I added those two cash flows together think of what Equity investors lenders gets kind of counter-intuitive because nobody thinks about lenders as partners but they're providing Capital as well that Collective cash flow is called the cash flow to the firm it's a pre-dead cash flow because every claim order gets paid out if that's the cash flow you're discounting you can no longer just use the cost of equity because that's what the equity investors want you now have to bring in the cost that lenders imposed on you that's called the cost of debt and take a weighted average is starting to sound remotely familiar if I take a weighted average of your cost of equity in your cost of debt you're taking a corporate finance class right what's it called the costly Capital don't call it whack it sounds so crude let's just call it caustic capital I hate that word whack this whack that and after a while you're not sure what you're talking about it's going to cost the cap the weighted average or whatever so if you're discarding cash flows to the business you discount it back at the cost of capital and you know what you've just valued you valued the entire business so that's one of the first rules in valuation is don't mix and match you know what I mean by mixing and matching don't take cash flows to equity and discount them at the cost of capital don't take cash flows to the firm in this condiment the cost of equity sounds like an obvious first principle but it's amazing how often it's violated so I'm going to show you a table and I'm going to lay the foundation the history of this table it's from the 1970s I don't use case studies in my class but I do use Harvard case studies primarily for the last value I mean there's a lot of funny stuff going on you can talk about and laugh about it but this is from a Harvard case study in the 1970s it was actually written in the 80s but it's case studies in the 70s it's a company was a copper mining company that had a coal mining subsidiary called Peabody Co the Anti-Trust laws were imposed and Kennecott was forced to divest itself of its coal mining subsidiary they received 600 million dollars on the sale Kennecott was a three billion dollar company at the time the sale so when you sell something and you receive 600 million cash you now have a lot of cash in your balance sheet and that terrified kennel cots managers he's saying what because they were worried that somebody would take them over using their cash as ammunition makes it easier to take over now I have two questions to ask about the 600 million cash new abandoned sheet it's a lot of cash you don't have much use for it what's the most sensible way if you're a company of a lot of cash in your balance sheet you want to get rid of it what's the most sensible way to get rid of that cash give it back to the owners right that thought never even crossed Kennecott managers man what would they do with the money stupid things like pay bills buy a car you can't allow that to happen so let me ask you the second question what's the dumbest way to get rid of 600 million in cash go to an investment bank and say I have 600 million in cash can you help me spend it this is like walking to Bloomingdale's with five thousand dollars in cash and answering can you help me spend it a lot of people that might work on commission maybe it's not in Bloomingdale's they're going to find something for you to buy right so Kennicott went to First Boston at the time one of the leading investment banks on Wall Street the leading m a bank and they said we have 600 million dollars we need to spend it quickly can you find us a Target in first Boston said and we find you a Target and they did they found the perfect Target why perfect they found a company called carburendum that coincidentally they could buy for exactly 600 million this is one of the first fruits you tell me how much cash you have in your balance sheet and I will find a company that magically sucks up all the cash thank you and of course you've got to give kind of card credit they said should we worry about no we might be paying too much they said no we'll do a valuation to back this up this was the valuation that first Boston did to justify ing credit card I'll tell you the mechanics of what they did and I want you to tell me whether there's a flaw in what they did because I'm going to ask you a question about how they computed cash flows and what discount trade is best right so I'll tell you how the cash flows are computed and as I go through it I want you to get a sense of what kind of cash flow estimate they start with the revenues they worked all the way down to to operating income then they subtracted out interest expenses they came up with net income then they added capex attracted I'm sorry added depreciation subtract cap X subtracted our debt repayments need be to come up with cash flows now I just described how they got cash flows right so file that away because that's going to give you a clue for the for the question I'm going to post to those are the cash flows I have I need to pick a discount rate and I'm going to give you six possible choices and only one of them is the right one ready you could use either cost of equity or cost Capital already I wanted to think about how I computed the cash flows to make a decision on which of those I can use the acquiring companies in this case can of course cost of equity after all it's coming up with the money or cost of capital or I can use carburetor the target company's cost of equity capital or I can come up with the merge companies cost of equity of capital so let's start with the easy one first given how I computed cash flows should I discount at a cost of equity or a cost to Capital yes and tell me why what is it about what I did that led you to that answer I took out interest expenses and debt payments I looked at cash flows left over after debt payments and in fact I started with net income which is an equity income so it should be cost of equity now let me you ready for the second question because this is Messier acquiring company or Target company and if you get it wrong don't feel bad because half of an investment bankers actually get this answer wrong acquiring company or Target company's customer and tell me why she doesn't even need this glass she gave I think one of those fundamental truths that people forget about this contracts discount rates should not reflect the rate at which you raise money they should reflect the riskiness of what you're discounting this is not a Miami should be when you're doing acquisition valuation the acquiring company's cost of equity and capital should never come into the picture it should always be the target company's characteristics that should come in what about the merge company who you can't merge a risky companies this is like a 300 pounder event Marrying an 80 pounder and saying look in our weights on average are the weights we need to be you're still obese and the other person is underway taking an average weight doesn't make it okay it is it should and what does that number look like 16 and a half percent that was the right discontractors first Boston leading M A Bank on Wall Street guess what they used as the discount rate what's the worst possible choice you can make wrong company wrong discount rate they used the acquiring company's cost to Capital of ten and a half percent now this might seem like absolutely you say who cares you take a set of cash flows you discount them at 16 and a half percent you come up with the present value you take those same cash flows you discount them at ten and a half percent you're going to come up with a much higher value the reason they found this deal to be a good deal was not because this was a good company to buy but because they used the wrong discontract and for this amazing contribution they got paid fees for being the bankers on this team now part of you saying but they must have did that they picked the ten and a half percent because it gave them the high value I wish I could say that because I've seen what happens in investment Banks when you have an acquisition deal there's a team half the team goes off and works on cash flows the other half work under this country they're in separate groups there's a deadline there's always a deadline Investment Bank it's always midnight tonight don't ask me why and 1158 both teams gathered together only two minutes before the deadline one as the cash flows the other is the discontracts what have you been taught discounted cash flow evaluation that's cash flows there's discount rates let's bring them together this happens over and over again because people don't even ask a question what are these cash flows I'm discounting we're going to extend this principle to currencies if your cash flows are in Indonesian Rupiah your discount rate has to be in Indonesian Rupiah if your cash flows are real you discount rate is be real but this is the start of that consistency discussion and I want you to remember this foreign because often you will see a name on top of a discounted cash flow evaluation and you're going to say but KKR must know what they're doing Goldman Sachs must know what they're doing not necessarily so when the next discounted cash flow valuation you see run it through this test check the cash flow is it after that payments or before debt payments check the discount rate and if it's an acquisition check which company's discount trade is being used because that's going to give away the air you know who headed first Boston in the 1970s when they became a leading M A Bank two men the names of Bruce wasserstein and Joe perella I remember was the same perilla I talked about in the last day they couldn't value 20 bill in a brown paper bag this is how they got rewarded for years of malpractice and acquisitions they got to start their own firm that did m a deals and they ruined the practice for 10 years and you know how they got rewarded for all that malpractice or punished dressed in a bank bought Washington perella for two and a half billion dollars and I can't make this up for their valuation expertise there's no justice in this world there's no punishment for bad valuation practices especially when deals get done so today's session we're going to focus in we're going to first wrap up that that big picture that we were talking about so and then we're going to focus in on the first steps in valuation so let me find the presentation let me go back to the valuation intro section we were talking about intrinsic valuation right remind me again for intrinsic evaluation what you're doing you're valuing a company the price is different than you say getting done is says please God let the price adjust to that and God will not listen he's too busy doing other stuff I mean he's covet there's pandemics you think he's going to worry about your evaluation being different from the price but we tried every single time divine intervention is always the risk management tool we fall back on when everything else fails but while there's no guarantee the price will adjust to value there are some cases where you can improve your odds let's think about what you might need for discarded cash flow evaluation to work for you first you got to be valuing assets which have expected cash flows they don't have to be positive you need expected cash flows right you can't do intrinsic valuation if you're valuing Bitcoin or if you're trying to invest in you know I don't know gold but you can do intrinsic valuation if you're valuable business value your stock value for Bond that's the first ingredient you need something with cash flows but let's look at the ingredients you have to bring to the game for intrinsic evaluation to work for you first you need to understand the basics of evaluation be able to Value companies you also need a long time Horizon do you see why because you need time as your ally for price to adjust value because even if you're right it might not happen tomorrow it might not happen in two weeks it might take two years for it to happen the longer your time Horizon the greater your odds it's not guaranteed even that but the great herons and third wouldn't it be nice if right after you found an undervalued company and took a position in it you could be the catalyst that causes the price to move to value magical right saying how do I do that what does Carl I can't do a right after he takes a position on a company or Nelson pills they're on CNBC and what do they say look at this company's massively undervalued and they might believe it but you can see the advantage there of being somebody with a megaphone is now other people here you and they say well Carl I can thinks the stock is undervalued I'm going to go and buy the stock it's an advantage and activist investors that's what we call these people have over passive investors is you might be able to provide the cash but you and I don't have those characters and we'll talk more about what you might look for in a company that might provide the Catalyst we'll make one suggestion it's morbid but you might want to buy undervalued companies with 80 year old CEOs and let you flesh out why that might matter but you need something that makes the market rethink the company some event right now you see why an 80 or CEO is a good Target and the event might be something that you that 80 year old CEO obviously doesn't look forward to but as an investor you're saying I know it's it's the clock is ticking on 81 82 I mean this CEO might keep going until 115 but you know you need a cactus so as we go through this class I'm not going to argue that valuation intrinsic valuation should be the tool you pick because you might have a Time Horizon of 16 minutes or three months even if you can do intrinsic valuation right you shouldn't be trying it in your portfolio you don't have time as your other so that's intrinsic valuation let's talk about pricing the essence of pricing is you no longer have a belief that there's such a thing as intrinsic value you basically say price is determined by demand and Supply so to price something I'm going to look at what other people are paying for similar things I don't know whether you've heard the old Lord Kane's description of Mark does anybody know the use of a beauty contest to describe markets do you know how we described markets what did he say s don't be sexist here it could be that it could be a pretty as anybody on the lineup right so basically in in Cain said he said look if you're a judge in a beauty contest your job is not assess who the best looking person on the stage is look at the other judges to see who they think so when you're judging a beauty contest you're not even looking at the stage you're looking at the other judges you see how pricing works the same way and repricing things you're not looking at what something is worth by itself you're looking at it what do they think what did they think so in pricing you're basically making an assessment based on what other people are paying for similarities so let's say what you would need for pricing to work first is you either need to find something exactly like what your what you're pricing so that's very unusual but if you find a company in another company almost a twin you could say that was up there it's almost exactly the same company let's see whether they price differently you see no chance of that maybe I'll give you an example where you might find it let's say of a company listed in two markets it's the same company and they traded different prices even after you adjust for exchange rates and what's called Arbitrage you have two companies different prices it's a price again well if you can't find an identical company you might try to find companies that you claim are similar to your company the reason I use claim is it's a judgment call well you know I'm going to look for companies the same geography the same market cap but you look for companies like yours and you can't compare prices across companies because prices are in a sense arbitrary I do a two foot one stock split the stock price drops by half it doesn't make it cheaper expensive so you scale the price to something price to earnings Price to Book so basically a multiple is just a standardized price so let's see where we are you have 15 companies that you claim are just like your company you've standardized the price for each of the 15 companies price earnings Price to Book EV tablet you take your pack you compare your company to those 15 companies and if you're careful you ask one final question is my company different from these 15 maybe it is higher growth maybe there's more risk and you adjust for those differences in a nutshell that's what pricing is you take every equity research report a well done one will basically go through those steps in pricing are you assuming markets make mistakes yes but the mistake markets are making is they get the sector right you're making the assumption that on average companies are correctly priced in the sector they're getting individual companies wrong you see how that's different from intrinsic valuation right intrinsic valuation of mistakes that correct over time here mistakes in What's called the cross-section different kind of assumption but when you have something mispriced against 15 other companies kind of sticks out like a sore thumb right your company trades at eight times earnings everything else in the second trades at 20 times earnings people notice even people are casual go on Yahoo financing that company trades at eight times earnings it's cheap you see where I'm going Corrections here happen more quickly because it's not like intrinsic valuation where people have to come around your point of view about cash flows and growth and risk this is a pricing judgment so if you think about what the advantage of pricing are first is you're working in sync with the market you're saying look my job is to not gauge the market it's to find cheaper expensive stocks and if your job is to find undervalued stocks or underpriced stocks you're going to find them with pricing half of all stocks roughly speaking will always look cheap and that's a good thing for you if you have to be invested in equities second if you look at pricing there will always be underpriced stocks you're always going to find that and finally at least on the surface pricing looks like it's less work an intrinsic valuation right entrance evaluation you can understand the business the cash flows the growth the risk and build models pricing what do you do you take PE ratio compared to 15 other companies say hey this company is cheaper expensive I'm going to argue that that is at the surface because if you build behind if you look behind those those multiples you're using guess what's driving the multiples differences in cash flows and growth and risk so it's kind of a surface level assessment but you can see why many analysts prefer pricing in terms of disadvantages because of the way you do pricing if an entire sector is overpressed social media companies AI companies Cloud companies because you're doing pricing something's always going to look cheap you're going to find something that looks cheap relative to other companies but they're all overpriced guess what's going to happen there's going to be a correction across the sector your only consolation price might be you lost only 30 percent of your money and everybody else lost 50 which actually is good right because it's a portfolio manager you're judged against other portfolio managers you can see why portfolio managers prefer pricing to valuation they have to be investment equities they get judged against other portfolio managers no so when you do pricing you're implicitly assuming markets are correct on average and that can get you into trouble across the market across sectors and finally this is something we're going to spend a lot of time on when we get to pricing when you use a multiple and I'll give you an example let's suppose you're paying 200 times earnings for a company why because all the other companies in the sector are paying you know you pay 200 250 times already so you pay 200 times are you assuming something about growth and earnings when you pay 200 times earnings implicitly you're assuming that there's going to be high growth in the future right the promise is implicit you never make it explicit every time you use a multiple you're making implicit assumptions about the future and because they're implicit you're even unaware of what you're assuming what if I told you that 200 times earnings your earnings have to grow at 80 a year for the next 10 years that might scare you but because it's implicit you never get to that point of view so when you think about the advantage of disadvantage let's think about when pricing works best pricing works best in when you're trying to price something where there are lots of similar things out there that are similar that are priced so it tends to work better know fairly well in a market like the US where you've got you know every sector is 50 60 80 stock but if you're the Portuguese Market with only 100 companies in the entire Market you might very quickly run into a rock because your company might be the only one in that we'll talk about ways of getting around it gets even worse if you're pricing something that's truly unique you see why pricing of Picasso is going to be much more difficult than pricing a software company why because to price it because you have to find other picassos that got traded recently and guess what picassos don't get sold and bought very frequently which means you might have to go back two years and find one transaction it becomes much more difficult to do pricing when you don't have lots of traded assets and to price things you need to scale it to something right so that's easy enough to do with stocks you traded a trade with real estate you might trade you might uh you might you you might scale it to square foot the square footage right you say price per square foot how do you scale a Picasso big Picasso was a small Picasso maybe that's what we should do square footage of the Picasso but that's not the way it works right because it depends on the quality the painting now do you see why appraisers for paintings get six percent of the appraisal fee because you're now pricing things and it's not easy because you don't have lots of comparable assets lots of transactions but from an individual perspective again let's think about what you need to bring to the table for pricing to work for you first you need to have relatively short time Horizon six months a year second you need to be judged not against absolutes but against other people doing the same thing so your growth this is why I said mutual fund managers will tend to price things not value them because you can already say and finally just like an intrinsic valuation there's a way in which you can augment the benefits of pricing if you can go on both sides of pricing mistake let me explain most mutual funds in the US are long only you know what that means right they can only buy so when you're pricing things what can they do they can buy underpriced stocks and hope and pray they get correct at its at their core what's what sets hedge funds apart from Mutual Funds what can hedge funds do yep sure they can sell short which means they can decide that if something is overpriced so now do you see why if you're good at pricing and you can play Both Sides you're going to buy the Enterprise you're going to sell the overpriced you know they don't care whether the markets right or not because as they both adjust you're going to make money now do you see why Citadel made 16 billion dollars in 2022. by D Shaw made 8 billion last year if you're a good hedge fund most hedge funds are bad hedge funds and they're nothing works but if you're good at pricing you can augment the benefits if you can go on both sides no it's we're going to spend more time in pricing but let me set the table on something that you might run into especially after you've taken a valuation class maybe Thanksgiving dinner your uncle or Aunt who sits next to you say can you value Bitcoin can you value gold can you value picassos so I'm going to draw a line between what can be valued and what cannot be valid if you have acids and my definition of assets is they generate cash flows it could be a business it could be a stock it could be a bond you could both value it and price it would be the stocks all the time if you have a commodity you could value it at a macro level so if I asked you what the fair value for oil is you could hire a macro economist look at the demand for oil and the supply for oil it's really messy right so Commodities get priced and they get priced against historical Cycles in fact the way people used to price Commodities they look at the history and say this is what coal prices have done this is where we're going if you have a courage and I mentioned this in the very first class you can't value a currency you can price it you call it an exchange rate so good currencies would say their pricing go up relative to bad currencies might be as good a time as any to ask a question what makes for a good currency no yeah once why do we have currency in our pockets Where Do We Carry we want to pay for things so first thing we need in a good currency is a medium of exchange right second if you leave it in your pocket and you forget about it for a year pull those pants up you know from last year you put them on you want to make sure that the the currency is stuck in your back pocket is what about what it was before it's a good store event Swiss franc great currency think about what you have Swiss Francs in your pocket you leave Switzerland not only is it a medium of Exchange in Switzerland it can be a medium of exchange anywhere in the world you can walk into any Bank anywhere in the world hand in Swiss Francs and with an exchange rate they'll give you the equivalent amount in rupees rupiah dollars great medium of exception and I actually put a hundred Swiss Francs oh no note in my pocket like five years ago I forgot about three years I would go back to Switzerland I was actually able to buy more with the hundreds with francs and I was three years before because there was a deflation in the beer great currency because good medium of exchange great store of value what about the Venezuelan Bolivar I don't even think they take the Boulevard in Venezuela right they said give me letters instead greatest staying power terrible medium of exchange and if you put a thousand Boulevard in your pocket and you forget about it for a year you might as well throw it in the trash because with high inflation it loses value every degree medium of Exchange so when you think about currencies and you think about pricing over time you're going to see good currencies appreciate in price relative bad currencies I want you to think about it is Bitcoin a good currency using the questions I asked you is it a good medium of exchange when is the last time you bought a cup of coffee or a cappuccino with Bitcoin is it a good store of value I pray you didn't buy it a year and a half ago at fifty thousand dollars because you've lost sixty percent it's a terrible currency it's an inefficient currency I mean who creates a character every time you spend the currency a thousand Ukrainian miners have to guess a nine digit number currencies can be priced and if you want to ask is Bitcoin worth twenty thousand or twenty two thousand or twenty three thousand the question you have to address is is Bitcoin a good currency I don't think it is but maybe you do foreign and I talk about collectibles is one collectible that is stood the test of time that's been around it even predates currencies what am I talking about gold right it's been around for hundreds hundreds of years basically yeah I think people in there they went back to the BC and there's gold and we could talk about what it is about gold that gave it this special power One turns out to be the fact that it's almost indestructible you can melt it but you know and the second is it's malleable so you can make it into coins so whatever reason it got that that that that collectible but it's a collectible Collectibles cannot be valued they can be pressed so let's think about why it is that the price of gold goes up and down what are they priced against paper currencies collectively right if you don't trust paper currencies you don't trust governments you don't trust central banks guess what you do you hold on to gold because gold outlasts them I mean before 71 in fact paper currencies were tied specifically to gold with the gold standard that's no longer true so gold is basically the place you go no and of course any collectible people buy Fine Art if they're buying it as an investment they're buying it because they think it's better than holding paper currencies and Investments and maybe Beanie Babies 22 years ago you said you know what I'm going to take my entire wealth and buy Beanie Babies what I'm trying to say is when you think about Collectibles people latch aren't the Collectibles some have lasting bad gold is the most extreme example but if you bought a Mickey mounted rookie card it's kind of holding its what the Barry Bonds rookie card maybe not so much but the argument that some people make for Bitcoin is its Millennial gold you know what I mean by Millennial gold you're 35 years old you don't want to buy gold because that's what your parents did and that's all old-fashioned see by Bitcoin instead and that's been an argument for Bitcoin and that's a testable proposition right is Bitcoin a good collectible how would you test it what does a good collectible do go up in value and inflation increases go down in value and inflation decreases go up in value where there's a crisis go down in value when there's no crisis and guess what Bitcoin has done with every crisis it's actually gone down it's behaved like very risky stocks not like gold so if you're going to make a case for Bitcoin pick a real case stop giving me this nonsense about it being scarce I know it might be crude to you but dog poop is scarce right there's only a certain number I mean you know someone who you know bringing it no there's only a certain amount of the face of the earth I don't go around and say this is good currency there's only a certain amount of dog poop in the wood I don't try that because you'd laugh me out of the room so when somebody says only 21 million Bitcoin in the world it's going to go up in price incredibly weak argument to make so with that long leader let's talk about one potentially I said there are only three ways to attach a number to comp to an asset asset could do intrinsic valuation you can do pricing or you can do that there's one detour where people say well isn't this different it's called acid-based valuation but rather than value a company you value the assets that it holds he's saying why would I do that it might be because you're an accountant a lot of account valuation is fair value accounting and you're asked to put a number in each individual ass it might be because you're planning to liquidate the company right we have to stop the company you're going to sell off the piece we want to know what they're worth it could be because you want to buy the company because you think it's worth less than the sum of its parts in each of those cases you've got to put the number not in the company but on the individual assets but here's why I don't think it's a different way of value companies to put a number on an asset I have to do one of two things I have to either do an intrinsic valuation of that asset or pricing of the assets if you own five real estate properties to put a number on it I can price the real estate looking at what other real estate is selling for or doing it this is not a separate way of value just separate application of either intrinsic valuation or pricing and we'll come back and talk about how to do a trend we'll take a company value the sum of its bugs and talk about what the potential pitfalls are for why we don't do it with every company so I'm going to show you a question I don't expect you to answer it now but take a look at this question make a choice now for the moment over the next 15 weeks you're going to do an intrinsic valuation of your company in a pricing of your company I'm going to come back and ask the same question at the end of this class after you've done entrance evaluation and after you've done pricing I'm going to see if your views have changed so right now you might say I'm a True Believer in intrinsic valuation I'm a rational person this makes more sense but after you've negotiated your way through an entrance evaluation you might change your mind so leave open that possibility so make a choice now and the same slide will show up in the very last class and let's see if your choice is which brings me to the third and final way you can put a number on a company you guys have done option pricing in one of your other classes right act like you have even if you've forgotten everything about it now I'll give you I will assume you've forgotten everything when we get to option pricing but the essence of an option is that there's an underlying asset options are leeches they derive their value from something else that's why they call derivative assets and there's a contingency something that triggers your payoff you know what I mean by a contingency and a call option the stock prices rise above the strike price so in the last 50 years we've become better and better at pricing options I'm not going to look at the traditional uses of options but the best way to think about what makes an option an option is to draw a payoff diagram you draw the payoff diagram for something and it looks like this I don't care what you call it there is an option embedded there you know what what's uh unique about option payoff diagrams if you have a call option you get the right to buy at a fixed price you can never lose more than what you paid for the call option with a put option we get the right to sell at a fixed price you can never lose more than what you paid for the option remember that those what never lose more so you've got limited losses potentially unlimited profits right you're saying why does that matter when you look at an option and you try to Value it one of the things you're going to see happen is that risk instead of being your enemy becomes your ally do you when you value traditional Asset Risk goes up the value of the asset goes down you do a pricing risk goes up the pricing goes up with an option when risk goes up the value of the option actually goes up why is that all right good well you could say that about every risky asset right so it's not the baked into the price that sets it apart yes in fact let me reframe the question how many of you have Lane you know stayed awake at night worrying about upside risk and if you say oh my God my stock might go up 80 that terrifies me do you see where I'm going right when you think about risk it's downside risk that you worry about and what have I done with options I just showed you the payoff diagram I've limited your downside risk that's really the secret ingredient so when we talk about options I'm not interested in applying option pricing to Value warrants and traditional options that's a different class there's an options in Futures class you can take in this class I'm interested in applying option pricing to Value certain kinds of assets cash flows business I'll give you a few examples I'm going to argue that when you buy shares in a deeply troubled company let me be specific about what makes you deeply troubled your money losing you have a lot of debt your money losing a lot of debt what's hanging over your head bankruptcy are distressed the equity now starts to behave like an option you know what what's your worst case scenario is it that bad enough what's your best case scenario the company comes back you buy equity in a deeply troubled Airline you're not buying it for the traditional reasons I hope and pray you're not buying it for the dividends all the cash flows unless you like large negative cash flows you're buying it because something good might happen and then you get done you say please let something could happen and something good happens the one dollar you invested in the stock I mean this is through I remember in the mid 90s when Continental Airlines at that time you know one of the leading airlines in the U.S was trading at one dollar per share why because it was in the verge of bankruptcy if you bought the stock at one dollar per share two years later the stock was trading at 52 dollars per share of course most of the time when you buy it come shares in a deeply distressed company guess what happens to your equity it goes to nothing but all you need is a few big Winners it's a diff I mean there's there's an area of investing called vulture investing basically you invest in deeply travel companies companies and big and you're buying options and you're not buying these companies the traditional way so I'm going to apply option pricing to Value equity in a deeply travel company you buy shares in an oil company the oil company has reserves but the reserves are all high priced Reserves see the oil prices are not forty five dollars but all your reserves the cost of extracting the oil is sixty dollars to there can I ask you how much would you pay for those results you're probably saying why would I pay for the results they're they're oh no it doesn't make sense for me to extract the results why might you still pay for those Reserves because price of oil is all over the place right two years ago it was 32 dollars a year and a half later was a hundred dollars you're buying an option again it might not pay off you might throw the option away but if oil prices come back your oil company could turn back I'm going to Value undeveloped Reserves at natural resource companies as options you buy shares in a young pharmaceutical company no revenues no earnings lots of expenses but it's got a promising product working its way through a pipeline you're buying an option it's not something you're going to use in every company but there are some companies who are bringing an option pricing is going to give you insights and that's really why you're doing it because in those companies remember what I said risk now becomes your ally you're seeking out the riskiest deeply troubled companies you can find sounds like a strange thing to do right you don't worry about trust me you don't want to buy safe deeply troubled companies I'm not even sure what that means but basically the company says I lost 100 million last year I can guarantee I can lose a hundred million every year in perpetuity you don't want that right if you want a company that's in deep trouble you wanted to be swinging all over the place because that's how you make your money option pricing is going to give you insights into what drives the value of these companies in some cases you might actually bring an option pricing model and I will try to Value these companies so let me summarize there are only three ways you can put a number on something you can value it you can price it or we have contingent cash flows you can attach a number based on the option pricing of the company there's no right or wrong each one comes with advantages and disadvantage which one you decide to pick will depend both on what you've been asked to put a number on and your personal characteristics as an individual do you have a long time horizon or a short time Horizon are you judged against absolutes or you judge against other people so any questions about the big picture so let's start on the first packet here of election notes so if you did it if you didn't print off the first packet don't worry about it it's you know you can you can take a look at it when you get a chance but all right sorry about this it's a big packet as you can see it will tell me probably that I think sure I'm sharing the screen and I think I am okay yeah I wish for the good old days where you could just get up and put the slides up so yeah let me try it again because it doesn't show me the screen of the wood I first left oh there you go thank you okay so let's get started this is the packet that's going to take you through almost two thirds of the class right so let's start by restating what I just said about intrinsic valuation intrinsic valuation the value of an asset is the present value of the expected cash flows on the asset I think now of course the tool that we tend to use most frequently to do intrinsic valuation is discounted cash flow evaluation but remember intrinsic valuation predates discounted cash flow evaluation how people did it might they might have had a you know an accountant appraised the value of things but reality is intrinsic value is a much broader idea than discounted cash flow valuation now if you think about discounted cash flow evaluation itself it's again very simple it's that extension of that first class you all get in finance the value of an asset is the present value of the expected cash flows in the azure now normally in a typical discarded cash flow evaluation here's what you do you have expected cash flows in the numerator expected cash flows that reflect all the different things that can happen to your company that's my expectation and then you risk adjust the discount rate more risky casual that's a typical discounted cash flow valuation but there's a second way in which you could do discounted cash flow valuation that's almost never done right when I've rarely done but when it's done it's almost always done wrong and here's what you do instead of using expected cash flows use what I call certainty equivalent cash flows he said what the heck is that ever seen this show called let's make a deal with Howie Mandel now you've never seen it must have really low ratings I'll give you I'll visualize what the show looks like so you're a contestant you come up on the stage and how we greet you he says welcome to the show he points to two suitcases up on the stage and one suitcase he says has a million dollars the other has nothing then he offers you money to walk away from the deal see ready there's a two suitcases one with a million one with the zero what's the expected value it's 500 000 right most of you though will accept less than 500 000 to walk away why is that what risk of us human beings are risk of us if you're at risk neutral you would never need to adjust this cartridge you just use the fact is when you adjust for risk you're saying I don't care for risk so here's what how he does he says would you take three hundred thousand now some of you might the most risk-averse among you some might take 350 some might take 400 000 if I were able to come up with a consensus number maybe it's a 420 000. that's called a certain equivalent cash flow how the heck am I going to do this evaluation first you get how you Mendel to sit next to you then you take the expected cash flows in Coca-Cola and say every year he said well there's expected cash flow of two dollars per share what would I need as a guaranteed cash flow to replace it maybe I'll set up a dollar eighty dollar fifty dollar Thirty now do you see why people don't do this approach this kind of cash flow valuation because you have to go in and adjust the cash flows and make them in a sense guarantee cash flows and once you do that guess what uses your discount rate use the risk-free rate because your cash flows are guaranteed you'll never see this done but there are some investors who use a variant without ever calling in this now one of the things you got a bird you have a burden of dealing with an evaluation class is all the things that Warren Buffett has said over his lifetime that people throw back at you no matter Warren Buffett does this why are we doing this and one of the things Warren Buffett I mean I don't know whether I've actually found him saying this but supposedly I said is he does it doesn't adjust for risk in his discontent he doesn't like betas he doesn't adjust for risk and people say well Warren Buffett doesn't adjust for risk why are we doing the risk adjusted this contract the question you got to address then is what does Warren Buffett do that obviously succeed with how does he get away know what Warren Buffett does though when he forecasts earnings and cash flows he just forecast that portion of earnings and cash flows that he says he can count on he doesn't use the word certainty equivalent but essentially he's not counting all of the earnings and cash flows he's counting as subset he's doing in his mind a risk adjustment on the cash class it's all right here's what you cannot do them if you do that on your some of you an attorney evaluations will tell me that you've done a conservative estimate of your cash flows in other words you've used lower than expectations if you do that and you adjust the discount rate up for risk your risk you're you're guilty of double counting risk pick your poison up front are you going to adjust the discount rate for risk are you going to try to play with the cash flows but let's stay on this page because I'm going to use this to kind of talk about you know intrinsic valuation 101. and I want somebody to be my guinea pig in this process so I'm going to pick somebody at the front row it's easier for me to do yeah you want to be my guinea pig okay so I have an envelope I'm not say all my sleeves are up so I'm not a magician I've got a 20 dollar bill I'm going to put in the envelope ready how much would you pay for this envelope don't take too long that's the answer I usually get let me follow up if you pay twenty dollars for an envelope or twenty dollars what do you walk away with from this transaction you walk away with this battered envelope which I stole from the ninth floor so first rule in intrinsic valuation if you know the value of something and you have to start the bidding try again Lower number or higher number than 20. low enough you you don't have a future as a banker because of the choice you just made because if you're a bank you probably start with a higher number for whatever reason start with a lower number five dollars you don't know what disease I have maybe I yeah but you're right this is such a simple ass that anybody should be able to buy right so if I open this up to bidding I'm going to end up with about twenty dollars for twenty dollar now I'm going to make things interesting I'm going to put in a card in there what does it say control I'm going to put control into the envelope remember there's a twenty dollars I've now added control to the mix how much should you pay for this envelope now how much more give me give me a number can you give me twenty one dollars in which case what have you paid for a dollar for a three by five card you know how much it cost me to create this card absolutely nothing but I can see why you were there right because again I told you you didn't have a future as a banker maybe I should rethink it because you know why I picked the word control if you've ever worked at a bank and you're doing an acquisition you know what the rule of thumb is you value the target company and you add a 20 control premium I tried this experiment on a group of Goldman Sachs Bankers they were not they were actually seasoned Bankers brought back for a re-education camp and one of the bankers decides he's going to be clever he says I'll pay 25 I sold him the envelope he said I didn't really mean it I said now you feel the pain it's because it's your own money but when it's your clients money you don't seem to care that much let's keep playing what does it say Synergy that's a big one let's put that in there again it's a three by five card with the word synergy how much people pay for Synergy as a buzzword since we're on this what does this say ESG oh let me put that in there I'm a good company yeah it should be worth another 20 right what does it say brand name brand name if you're a marketing you're doing you know somersault this is why we came into company I can put that in there all three by five cuts I call these weapons of mass distraction you know why I call them weapons of mass destruction these are the words that will show up after you valued a company because people want you to pay a premium and I'll give you the two words that if you really have to sell something for way more than it's worth will get you a premium what does this say it's strategic if you ever hear that word in the context of an acquisition and you're the one paying Run for the exit door right now because you know what strategic means right the numbers don't fly but I really really want to do this strategically stupid deal but I want to do it anyway strategic buyer this is exactly the kind of buyer you want when you sell a business because they don't care what they pay and to show you how these words weapons of mass destruction can work in your favor and against you let me do one final word that used to work really well if you wanted to add an extra zero to your valuation what does it say China but the last decade you'd rather a company you come up with 10 billion and you're trying and the buyers pay playing hard to get no I can't I'm a charity buyer oh by the way we're in China at an extra zero 100 billion why a billion people somehow turns people's brains to mush they start adding zeros until a few years ago that word alone would add a 20 premium 30 premium today though it could work against you the problem with weapons of mass destruction is words that work one day will not work the next because you're not really valuing these words so I'm going to State a proposition that I find extraordinarily useful in cutting through and there's a lot of  in this place right I call it the it proposition if it does not affect the cash flows and it does not affect risk it cannot affect value saying what the heck is it you name it let's say control forget about what Bankers do forget about the 20 rule what's the true value of control what do we mean when we say I have control of a company what can you do anybody want to give that a shot what does control mean yes could it be um like some kind of option like now you can decide to do something which would change the way the company is right right so if you control Disney you might say I'm going to shut down Disney plus I mean this might be good or bad but basically it's my company I want to change the way the companies are to Value control you know what I need to do I need to Value the company twice once with the existing Management in place and once with you in place and if you're doing sensible things guess what I'm going to get I'm going to get a value higher than what I get from the existing management that is the value of control do you see the implications of this if I have a company that's already perfectly managed and perfectly right what's the value control of this company it's here I don't care what the bankers tell me if you have a company that's abysmally managed and horribly run it could be a hundred percent who makes up this crap of 20 control premiums what about brand name that's the power of a brand name in fact you want to see Brad name at play walking through CBS or drug fair or drug you know whatever that is a Duane Reade or whatever it's standard block down the painkiller right get to the aspirin section and I guarantee you you will see bare aspirin and right next you see a generic aspirin check the prices out if you don't believe me you're going to be about twice this much for the bear Aspen check the ingredients you know what you're going to see it's exactly the same thing but think of how many times you reach for the Sudafed they're all genetic versions because it makes me feel better soon that's the part of a brain name is they're playing games with your brain and God only knows where that gets embedded but it does affect your pricing and through your pricing it affects your margins later in this class we're going to Value Coca-Cola's brand name by isolating the power that that brand name gives the company every single one of those words I'm not saying Synergy doesn't have value control doesn't have value brand name doesn't have value but I'm saying if you want to Value it you got to do the homework of where it shows up at the cash flows and whether it affects risk if you get a chance I have a paper in ESG which is titled doing good or sounding good it kind of gives away where I'm coming from and I ask this question look you know you keep telling me yes he's good for Larry Fink kept telling me for years ago you feel good you're going to be more valuable my response is show me where and after digging for three years I can't find a single place to put it which means we've been sold a concept with no basis in value now for a decade and the selling doesn't stop second proposition I'm going to call it yeah go ahead um can you or I mean can you value control as let's say let's say you have like a very well-run company can you value control as maybe let's say you want to acquire that company as something that like you have to pay extra to make the share pay the wrong price I don't care how well around the company acquires I make my statement about m a at the wrong price I don't care how great a company acquire you just overpay you can't get that money back at the right price I don't care how crappy a company acquire is you have the potential value Acquisitions are always about the price you pay so unless you can figure out a way in which you can take that well run and do something different with that word that's the essence of synergy or doing you better tell me specifically what you can do differently to the existing management can offer you're a very dangerous ground acquiring companies for more than they want you know that eighty percent of Acquisitions are value destructive you know what I mean by value destructive you acquire the company your value is acquiring company actually goes down because you overpay filed it away because we'll talk about what it is about the process that might lead to that but that's something to keep in mind when you see acquisition-driven companies yes well you might not so what if there's no transaction why do you assume there has to be is is the definition of a deal that a deal get a good I mean it is you need a good deal right you know it gives you power deal making is when the price is too high you get up from the table and you leave you know how difficult that is to do once you start getting involved in a deal because somewhere along the way how do we Define a good deal a d good deal is a deal that gets done that's not a definition of a good deal a good deal is a deal that gets done at the right price but you let Bankers decide they will never let you leave the room right because as a banker how do you get paid by having the deal time for God's sakes lock the bankers out of the room if you want to do deals because they have a different it's not because they're bad people because their incentives are to get the deal done so if you're acquiring company and you refuse to pay a premium the target company says I won't sell that's okay right say okay steel doesn't make sense for us we'll walk away second proposition don't be a wuss I told each of you to pick a company you're going to start pre-estimating cash flows and about two weeks from now you're going to come to me and say I need to change companies and I'm going to ask you why and you're going to say because I'm getting negative cash flows when I look at my cash flows last year you're giving up way too soon right because the fact when I said you know when you look at when you look at what drives the value of companies not just cash flows next year it's cash flows over time I'm going to come you know as a companion give you what I call the dirt proposition which is we have a company you estimate cash flows not just next year but every year and the cash flow is a negative in perpetuity and ask me how much should I pay for the company I'm going to slap you around the face say wake up you got a cash burning machine that's never going to have a business model that makes money don't pay for it but just because you have negative cash flows up front you shouldn't give up yet and here's why can accompany negative cash flows up front become a valuable company in fact most great companies at some point in time are money losing companies right what has to happen the revenues have to grow the margins have to improve you know what Young growth companies will have negative cash flows up front it's a feature not above it's called Cash burn shouldn't stop you from investing in the company so when you look at these these companies and you start thinking about value I want you to go back to basics discarded cash flow is not some model it's not a tool it's basically a way of thinking about a business as a business and you know what once you think about a business as a business you got to think about cash flows and growth and risk so let's go back to where we started the class there are two choices Equity evaluation of firm valuation let me repeat you're doing Equity valuation you're going to take cash flows to equity cash flows left over after debt payments and discount them at the cost of equity if you're valuing the entire business you're going to take cash flows and you can see cash flows Equity right no after that payments discontinent the cost of equity alternatively you could take the cash flows pre-debt cash flows and discount them at the cost of capital so we're going to come back full circle you already solved it with the first person but here's the the final point if you decide to Value the entire business and you're still interested in valueing equity because that's what you buy or sell how do you get from the value of the business to Value Equity what do you have to do in other words you value a house and ask you to come up with the equity value what do you do you subtracted the debt understanding so this is something I want you to think about I'm not going to give you the answer right now but as we get further into the class we're going to come back to what debt should I be subtracting I value the entire business should I subtract only long-term debt should I subtract total debt should I treat leases as debt which accountants are doing now but no to subtract all libraries that includes accounts payable supplier credit I want you to think about it because it's going to give you very different answers to the equity and as we go through we're going to talk about consistency because when we get to cost to Capital One of the things you will need is a debt ratio there you had to make a judgment of what debt do I include in that I'll give give you a clue if you decide to go with only long-term debt when you do a costly cap and you should be subtracting only long-term debt you need to look at total debt when you do costing there's a consistency issue you've got to stick with here and I'll talk about exception of that rule but that's going to be the driving so we're ready to state the principle that drives valuation cash flows to equity discarded the cost of equity cash flows are firm you're discounted the cost of capital I'm going to give you a an example and I'll confess I've I've kind of cooked the numbers in this example to work in my favor so in this company I've given you cash flows to equity after that cash flows and cash flows above pre-dead cash flows cost of equity for this company is 13.625 and the cost of borrowing money is 10 pre-tax why pre-tax because interest is tax deductible when you borrow money at 10 you might effectively be borrowing at six or seven or this case five percent because the tax rate is fifty percent I'm going to Value the equity in this company directly first by taking cash flows to equity and discarding the cost of equity and then I'm going to revalue the company by taking the entire set of cash flows and discounting at the cost of capital and then seeing if I get the same value for Equity would you like to get the same value for Equity with the two approaches I would because otherwise you're in this strange position right buy the stock if I use this you want the same value Equity let's see if it works out so first I took the cash flows to equity discounted them back at the cost of equity I got a value Equity of 1073 million then I took the cash flows for pre-dead cash flows but to discard them I need a cost to Capital so I had an intermediate stock demand I had to take a weighted average of my cost of equity and cost of debt and I use the market values of debt and Equity to come up with the weights the weighted average cost of capital is nine point nine four percent and I take the cost of equity and what do you see the one minus tax rate is the fact that interest is tax debt I discount cash flows The Firm at the cost of capital I come up with 1873 value you say 1873 is bigger than one thousand ten three something's wrong well not really because that's the total value of the form If I subtract out the market value of the data I end up put the same almost magical right I told you I cooked the numbers to get there but it looks like if you do things right you get the same value equity of course if you mix and match all bets are off if I take cash flows to firm and discount them at the cost of equity a cash flows that I'm doing what first Boston did in the example but that's the consistency test I want you to think about just because you have cash flows your discount rate you can't bring them together and have a discount cash flow evaluation until you've stopped and made sure that you've got a consistency affected by mix and match it and I'll show you what the numbers look like if I discount it for instance the cash flows to the firm I'm cash flows to equity at the cost of capital I get too high a value for equity which is what first Boston did right they described and they use the wrong company's discount rate to begin if I take cash flows to firm and discount the cost of equity I'll come up with two lower value for the firm but then again I'm since I'm sloppy I might forget to subtract all the data who knows what I would do so when you do discounted cash flow valuations and you look at other people's discounted cash flow valuations check the consistency I told you you're going to get a weekly challenge each week this week's challenge is going to be built around this concept and there I'm not going to cook the numbers I'm going to give you a set of cash flows and I'll tell you ahead of time that when you value the equity directly in that example and then you valued indirectly by valuing the business and subtracting out that you're going to get different values for the equator which is going to leave you uncomfortable but then I'm going to ask you what it is about what you've assumed that's giving you different management there's something I've implicitly assumed in this valuation that allowed things to work and I want you to think as you do that weekly challenge what is that thing what is that assumption I made that allowed things to work and what happens when that assumption breaks down because then you're going to get different values of equity different depending on which path you pay any questions about okay so I'm going to stop I have two minutes left I can't believe I finished two minutes but I would see you on Wednesday 
thank you really good bye foreign it's an um okay folks I know my mic is working it's just that you're until the sound subsides you can't hear me so I'm going to start by asking a couple of questions and I'm really doing this to kind of Nag you how many of you are not part of a group let me repeat that again how many of you are not not part of a group yet really every one of you is in a group okay how many of you have not picked a company yet let's be honest it's okay no I want the numbers to go down over time obviously how many of you have not picked a company as your com company to Value okay so here's all I'm going to say pick one Sue all right so no obviously we're still early in the class but the longer you put this off the doesn't get any easier it's a big one sir any any other questions before we get started one final point I want to emphasize if you're a non-stern student you have a DOT an at nyu.edu email it's entirely possible that you're not getting the emails for this class because stir when you join a Stern class you're automatically giving us to an email so the Gmail the Google group that they create for this class is based on those third email addresses so if you're not getting an email it's probably because it's going to that Stern email address so there is a way in which you can see what that address is and you need it not just for the emails but also to access the databases that Stern has to sign on to Google The Google shared spreadsheets if you're having trouble that's probably the reason so you can't really sign into those sheets with a Gmail address or with the so try to see if you can get the stern email address so that you know you can you can take advantage of the resources so no questions let's get started today we're going to start to delve into the details evaluation and we're going to start simple to Value something you need to get a risk credit now it sounds fancy but you need to know what you can make on a guaranteed investment before you get all ambition say what will I make on a risky investment So today we're going to talk about risk-free rates and in the process we're going to crack what I call the currency code which is a lot of people misunderstand currencies but today hopefully by the end of the class you'll have a better sense of what drives or doesn't drive currencies so I'm going to have a series of questions for you to kind of and as I said the answers will be in the class if you're a little confused right now you don't have the answer don't worry about it let's say you're valuing a Brazilian company but you're doing the valuation in you know and you have a choice you can either valued in Brazilian re-ice or you can value it in U.S dollars the risk-free rate in realize is seven and a half percent let's say the risk free rate in dollars is two and a half percent okay so this is a very simplistic question give me a gut feeling now so same company same point in time same financials you get value it in three ice you get value it in dollars the risk rate Engineers is much higher than the risky rate in dollars which of these two currencies would give you the higher value of the company if either you want to try um okay that's not a first principle that's almost I hope it's true so you know it's a based on what you'd like to do you're right you don't want the numbers to be different but it looks like the discount rate and realize is going to be much higher than the discount rate of dollars everybody agree because you started the bigger base and aren't higher discount rate is going to lead me to lower value So today we're going to talk about why the first what you call the first principle is going to kick in because at First Sight picking a currency with a higher risk free rate should be a higher discount rate and by itself that seems like a bad thing for that yes I think that's the other half the equation your cash flows but then what exactly happened to your cash flows to offset the discount rate effect you got to start to become explicit about what is it that causes risk-free rates to vary across cards if it's growth and you're in trouble because then how can you have a high growth company in one currency and a low Growth Company in another currency So when you say growth are you talking about nominal growth yeah nominal growth which means it's not growth it's why the difference is in nominal growth the real growth is the same inflation today we're going to isolate the inflation effect on currencies and that's going to be a very healthy thing let's move on if you have to you know there's some people who believe in what what they call real valuation so their practice doesn't always reflect that for the longest time in Latin America people would refuse to Value their companies and local currency terms why because inflation is high they couldn't handle it they said we're going to do everything in real touch what does that mean well you're going to do your you know when you do your analysis you're going to ignore inflation all the way through so let's again ask this very generic question if you value a company in real terms you're going to get a different should you get a different value let's get that out of the way what the what is what the first principles tell us shouldn't be right same company what does it matter whether you do real or nominal today we're going to talk about what would you do differently when you value a company in real terms because you're now ignoring that inflation part of the growth that gives you this first principle if it doesn't matter our end result is we want it to not matter because if your company comes out with different valuations depending on the currency you pick or nominal real you're a deep trouble right because how do you decide a company is cheaper expensive let's keep going take the tea boundary right it's going up and down right now it's more towards the up level but for the bulk of the last decade U.S treasury bond rates have been at historic lows and if you ask most people or if you watch CNBC too much and that's damaging to your brain stop okay but if you do what is the wisdom you walk over with why why have rates been low for the last decade because the FED has kept them low doing what quantitative easing qe1 QE2 Titanic whatever you want to call it basically that they've been doing all this neat stuff that's why rates are low I mean if you listen to people long enough it seems like the FED controls rates in fact we're heading up to an fomc meeting Federal Open Market Committee meeting like today might be the day right everything on Wall Street comes to a complete stop all eyes are towards the Fed why because at least in terms of theory the what they do at the meeting is going to drive rates for the next few months or a year so what I'm trying to get a sense of how much power do you think the FED has and again for the moment give me your gut feeling on setting rates because you listen to the people on CNBC they must be setting rates right now and if they want to bring the rates down they can if they want to raise the rates they can so I wanted to start thinking about what are the rates the FED actually sets and how does it play out in your treasury rates the table rate the t-bond rate the mortgage rates the corporate borrowing rate because again I think there's a lot of Mythology about central banks that we need to dispense with one final point perhaps no longer true but about a year or two ago it started 2022 there are at least three maybe as many as five currencies where the risk-free rate was negative and it freaks people out it freaks people out for good reasons right in an econ class whenever you see an interest rates always a current prayer you never see negative interest rates I remember the first time negative interest rates started showing up 2015 2016. now get emails from people saying what do we do now and they can understand why people are uncomfortable with negative risk predates but our negative risk free rates impossible or just unlikely clearly they happen so what fundamentals might explain negative risk credits we talked about inflation let's get it so inflation is two percent three can inflation be minus three percent a year in fact what do we call that deflation today we're going to talk about how when you have low real growth and deflation negative risk free rates come out of the negative risk relates are not a sign of Health they're a sign of deep damage in the economy there are two parts of the world where we had negative risk free rates for a long period now one is Japan and the other is much of Europe you know what they share in common if aging populations and potentially shrinking economy no economies they've been able to grow while its population is shrinking and aging it's just it's a the demographics work against you So today we're going to talk about what to do when you have negative risk three days because in Europe I'll tell you what people did they started replacing they said it's a minus let's just take them take the minus out I feel much more comfortable now can we do that can we just drop off a side because we don't like it this will be great right we're doing a money money losing company act like the minus is not there your company just becomes a money-making company so we have lot on our plate today to deal with so let's get the process started so let's turn back to your notes I think we're on page 13 of your first lecture not packet so I am going to share again so we're going to start laying the foundations for discounted cash flow evaluation I'm going to say something obvious but take it forward it's what for discounted cash flow evaluation you need a CF and you need a d right a discount rate and a cash flow in fact every discounted cash flow model those are the combinations that make for so let me set up the process on what a generic discounted cash flow model will look like you're going to start with the most recent year you're going to project our expected cash flows in the future you're going to discount it back at a risk adjusted rate and you're going to come up with the present value there's one little mechanical problem I'm going to run into if you remember I said the value of an asset is the present value of the expected cash flows on that asset over its lifetime right so you have a 10-year asset you do 10 years of cash flows 20 or asset 20 years of cash flows when you buy shares in a publicly traded company at least in theory how long is its lifetime when you open a corporate charter tells you when the company is founded it might not be forever but there is no finite ending point right it could be 20 years it could be 50 years it could be forever so to value a company what do I have to do estimate cash flows forever this sounds like my vision of Health an Excel spreadsheet that never ends right you're one you're two you're three you're three thousand five fifty five and you're going and going and going you can't do that that's why the constant refrain your evaluations can I stop now how about right now I have an answer and you're not going to like my answer I say You're Gonna you can stop if you're willing to make an assumption the Assumption you have to make is beyond that point at which you stop your cash flows have to grow at a constant rate forever you know what that buys you it buys you an infinite Series in mathematics 200 years ago mathematicians solved for the value of the series we stole it in finance we act like we invented it but this is this famous terminal value equation you'll see at the end of every evaluation it's basically the present value of all cash flows beyond your 5 or 10 with that equation but for that to work your cash flows have to grow at a constant rate forever it's the most misused part of valuation because you can already see look at that equation how many games you can play so one of the things we're going to talk about is how to keep that number from running away from your valuation so generic DCF you have cash flows your cash flows grow to concentrate forever you have a discount rate you take the present value but how you measure cash flows and that's what we talked about last class is also going to determine what discount rate is right we talked about Equity versus The Firm so let's start with the four measures of cash flows you could potential I'm sorry if you look at cash with three measures of cash flows you can use to do valuation the first is you can say look I don't want to be estimating cash flows it's too much trouble too many estimates I'm just going to look at the cash flows the company actually returns to a shareholders in a purest sense that's the only cash flow you actually get from the companies and Equity investor right everything else is kind of on paper the dividend discount model is the oldest discounted cash flow model out there let me ask you are you buying Equity valuing the firm and you do it dividend discount model Equity so the discount rate has to be the cost of equity your growth rate has to be a growth traded dividends and your terminal value will occur when your dividends start growing at a constant rate forever but do companies pay out what they can afford to individance how the hell do I know there's actually proof that every company's balance sheet that tells you that companies don't pay out what they can afford to in dividends and what does that prove good the cash they have in the bench how the heck does Google end up with 100 billion in cash it's not Mana from heaven it's a direct reflection of the fact that year after year they've chosen not to pay out I'm not saying it's good or bad but I'm saying what companies pay out is set by management but it might not match what they could have paid out so the second way to do valuation is not trust the dividend but to estimate what the company could have paid in dividends and guess what it's very simple to do how much can companies afford to pay dividends whatever is left over after they've met every conceivable need capex working capital and it's all there in the statement of cash flows right you can see what's left we're going to come up with a measure of potential dividend that we're going to call free cash flow to equity kind of a fancy name but this is what they could have paid out so the second approach to valuation is to take those potential dividends replace the actual dividends of those potential dividends so a company like Google which pays no dividends now you'll be discounting something your growth rate will be the growth rate in free cash load Equity now rather than in dividends and when will you stop estimating cash flows is when that free cash flow Equity starts growing at a constant rate forever so as I go through these different approaches I wanted to think about what you do in common across the approaches and what's different so dividends and free cash flow Equity are both Equity valuation approaches one uses actual dividends one uses potential difference the third approach of course is to step back and say I don't care just about the equity I care about the entire Capital providers both debt and Equity look at the collective cash flow they make cash flow to the firm but the discount rate now will become the cost of capital rather than the cost of equity and your growth rate will be growth and free cash flow to the firm and you'll stop estimating cash flows when that growth rate approaches a growth rate that can be sustained in public shooting every discounted cash flow model shares the same structure the only difference is what you define as cash flow and the discount rate that goes with it so if I were to draw a dividend discount model my task is very simple I'll start with the existing dividends and for those existing dividends I'm going to look at dividends as a percentage of earnings called a payout ratio but everything is built around projecting the dividends that this company will pay and I'm going to discount them at the cost of equity and what I get is the present value is the value of equity in that company there are still people who hold on to this model the problem is a smaller and smaller part of the market fits into this model because fewer and fewer companies pay the kinds of dividends where you look at the dividend say that's pretty close to what they could have paid out maybe phone companies like Con Ed a free cash flow Equity model looks exactly the same but you have a little more work to do instead of trusting the company to pay out what it can for the moment don't worry about the equation we're going to come back and flesh them out I'm going to estimate the free cash load Equity the cash left over after every conceivable need has been a post debt cash flow I'm going to estimate a growth in that free cash flow Equity discounted the cost of equity and what I get is the present value will be the value of equity in the company and in fact since I'm doing the calculation I'm going to separate cash from everything else do you see why I want to do this remember we talked about keep things as simple as you can why mix in cash with everything else and try to Value cash when we know what the value of cash is so here I have the luxury of saying I can value all of the non-cash equity in the company and add the cash at the end I get the value of recording and then of course you got the most generic version of the model I estimate a pre-dead cash flow and as I said again don't worry about the equation we'll come back and and talk about the specifics of how we come to but these are pre-dead cash flows we discount them at the cost of capital and what we get is a present value and I want to listen carefully the next next statement because it's going to create a lot of follow-up cleaning up to do is the value of the operating assets of the company let me repeat that again when you take free cash flow to the firm which you start with operating income and you work through you value the operating Assets in the company what have you not valued you haven't valued cash that's the same thing as previously but if you have cross Holdings in other companies you haven't value those as well it's a whole lot of cleaning up to do to get from value The Firm to value so put all three pictures next to each other so you can see what you're doing in common what's different because that's the consistency issue making sure that once you've chosen a path you stay on that path so I'm going to describe the process by which we do valuation and the reason I'm going to generalize is we all go through this process how much attention we pay to each stage of the process differs across people so let's say you pick the company what's the first step what's the next step for you once you've picked a company you're going to go collect the data what does that mean you're going to get lost here's financials yeah before it's so easy to do it now right you go to in fact I sent you that link to s p Capital like you please get on as soon as you can it's an amazing database you can pull up 20 years of cash flows in your car every single line item in the accounting statement it's going to save you a huge amount of time time you're going to collect historical data then what are you going to do with the historical data you're going to pour over look at it but remember when you look at the historical data you're doing it not because you like to look at historical data what the heck is going on here you're doing it because you want to get some questions answered which you can use to project it's all about the future so the only reason we're looking at the past is to get better clues about the future in particular as you look at past data there are three questions I want you to try to answer how quickly has my company grown in the past okay my suggestion is focus on revenues because income can be all over the place how quickly is my company grown the best second how profitable has this come has my company been in the past you can look at operating income you can look at ebitda you can look at net income and the third question you're looking at is how much has my company been reinvesting to get this growth in the past it's all in the past but you're trying to get those questions answered because those are going to be the questions that drive your forecast in the future now if you have a company like Coca-Cola with a hundred years of financials there's obviously a lot you can extract from the financials if you have a company like Peloton there might be very little alert don't beat yourself up that's what it is but we start with the past not because we want to stay stuck in the past but we're looking for clues for the future so you assess the past and then you try to forecast the future I'm going to give you the two generic forecasting ways of doing this depending on the company you have if you have a company with stable operating modules you know what that means right they're earning about 12 percent of revenues as margins it looks like they've settled it they're mature company your job got a lot easier why because you can take operating income and forecast it out if your margins are stable why bother forecasting revenues you're going to multiply it by 12 every year you're going to end up with the operating income anyways to start with operating income and with stable margins you get an added bonus your expected growth in the future is going to be a product of how much you reinvest in how well you reinvest because you can't grow if you don't reinvest if your margin stays stable then your income will not grow if your revenues don't grow if you're you know and for your revenues to grow you've got to take new projects so reinvestment measures how much you put back in the business and how much your operating income will grow will depend on what kind of returns on Capital you make on that investment I'll give you an example you invest 50 of your money you make a 20 return on Capital your expected growth in operating income is going to be about 10 year 50 the very neat and mechanical way of doing evaluation but it works because your margins are stable we'll talk about the algebra that makes it work but with stable margins you can start with operating income use reinvestment and returns to forecast cash flows in the future that will work in about 10 percent of all companies why because most companies margins are shifting they're going up they're going down your margins might be negative right now there you have no choice but to start with revenues because there you got to forecast that revenues first so with Tesla you saw me forecast out revenues and the revenues go to four and Tesla right now actually you can get away using the stable margin assumption because I kept the margin stable but if you believe margins are going to go up or down you're going to have to forecast what that margin will look like for next year two years are three years are revenues times margins gives me operating income last step I'm going to look at what I need to reinvest to get that Revenue growth but my end game is still free cash for the firm how I get there is different in the two scenarios so start with the past I project that I've forecast out the future and how long do I have to keep forecasting till I get to a point where I'm willing to tell you that this company would grow it X percent year forever I'm going to call that a mature company a mature company in this class is a company that grows at a rate less than or equal to the growth rate of the economy and I'm also going to make the statement and I'm willing to back this up that every company no matter how high growth it is will eventually become a mature company you know why it's a scaling problem you get bigger and bigger and bigger at some point in time you're going to hit a wall I've heard this over my 40 years I've heard people to look at a company this company will never be a mature company I heard that about Walmart in the 1980s because it was an incredible Growth Company an amazing company until it got to about a half a trillion dollars in Revenue so it took a half a trillion before it hit the wall in contrast Groupon hit the wall at 10 billion why smaller you know competitive advantages lots of players in the game where you hit the wall is where you put the company to stable growth and that's going to be a judgment call you have to make with your company given its business what do you think about the company so I think Tesla will hit the wall around 400 billion Why by then it'll be one of the five largest companies in the world in terms of revenues the largest automobile company in the world even with the other businesses and I'm saying you know what 400 billion dollars you're going and it's not a bad end right you're growing at the rate of the economy so I'm not saying you're going to end and die as a company I'm saying from this point on you're just going to keep track with the economy so we'll come back and flesh out the mechanics but I want you to understand the process you start with the past but don't get stuck in the past you forecast the future but don't punish yourself am I getting this right and at some point in time you put closure and say at this point in time for my company I'm going to be a mature company and along the way of course you got to Discount these cash flows at a discount rate that reflects the riskiness of the competition I'm going to lay the foundations for how to think about this contracts you come you I come to you with a Young Money losing company just think in comments and stuff should I have a high discount rate for this company or a low discount rate to the company I should probably have a height it's a risky company a high discount rate on your spreadsheet tell me what you're doing to your small money losing company if you follow my tracks you're making a small company to a big company money losing into a money-making company you'd think caught from a common sense perspective the discount rate should change as you go from this Young Money losing company absolutely right do you know that in 95 of discounted cash flow valuations you see one discount rate and it never changes in fact there are some appraisers who are shocked you really can change discount rates over time that should be the rule not the exception maybe if he gave me a company that's already mature I can get away using one discard right but how can I value a company that's evolving and changing and not see the discount rate change so for the moment I'm not going to dive into the mechanics of risk premiums and betas but I want you to keep your door the door open of whatever approaches for discount rates that approach has to be flexible enough to allow you to change your discount rate as your company changes over time so let's review the steps start by looking at the past that's going to be your most comfortable time in this project why because it's all there you can blame the account it's if something go wrong goes wrong right start with but the test for you is are you willing to go from there to the forecast so it's assessing a discount rate coming up with cash flows putting up closure in each of those stages you have no choice but to make estimates and please don't be subjective as a curse it's all subjective of course it's subjective how can it not be subjective because you're looking at the facts and making your best if that's your definition of subjective be glad it's subjective because if we're not subjective why would you need to take this class right you could build a model that automates everything or use chat GPT to do your evaluations it's good that it's subjective be glad that's human intervention because otherwise why bother so today I'd like to start on the process of the D in the DCF let me ask you an obvious question does the D matter in DCF of course it does that's why I said DCF but it matters a lot a lot less than you think even before we start talking about discount rates I'll tell you what a healthy valuation should involve in terms of time breakup probably spent 10 to 20 percent of your time estimating discount rates and 80 to 90 percent on the cash flows that's what a good valuation should look like you know what a banking valuation time breakdown is 70 to 80 of your time is spent estimating this contracts and then towards the variance oh my God I don't have cash flows let me make up some crap when you're going to screw up an evaluation and that's I'm not saying that's a good objective it's going to be because you got the cash flows wrong not because you got the discount rate draw of all of the assumptions I made on Tesla the one that I least care about is the cost of capital you want to make it nine you want to make it 11 go ahead to me the bigger assumptions are about the market size and the margins that I'm assuming that's what's driving the valuation yes because it gives you a false sense of control these guys we have a lot of data in fact we can Outsource the data we use different firms Equity risk premiums get the risk-free rate from the it's a great way to pass the buck and say hey it's not my fault it's it's where we go because we want to be comfortable and again in this class I want you to get away from the places where you're comfortable and get to the places which make you uncomfortable because that's where evaluation battles are won or lost so let's start talking about this cartridge first let's lay the consistency point that we started last class if we have Equity cash flows you should be the cost of equity if you're trying to discount cash flows The Firm it's got to be cost to Capital today I'm going to add on two more consistency rules if you just estimate your cash flows in a specific currency your discount rate has to be in the same currency so if you decide to do your analysis in Nigeria naira your discount rate has to be a Nigeria United discount rate some horrendous mistakes can be made when you mismatch cash flows in this contracts and third if you decide to do your valuation in real terms then your discount rate has to be a real discount rate not a nominal discount rate real cash flows have no currencies attached to them right it doesn't matter if a dollar it doesn't matter when you're doing things in real terms you've kind of taken out the currency affect the inflation effect so to do all of this we go back and lay the foundations for this conference so when you think about the risk-adjusted discard right there are three ingredients you need to get to a risk adjustment the first is you need to risk credit whatever currency you're doing evaluation you cannot do valuation without a risk Trading second you need to measure what the price of risk is in the market what are people charging for investing in equities what's the default spread and third is you need a measure of how risky your company is relative to the average company do you need a risk-free rate do you need a measure of relative risk you need a measure of the equilateral script today we're going to focus almost entirely on the risk credit it should be the easiest of the three right but as before we do that though let's talk a little bit about risk I mean one one of the things I would like you to do once you've picked a company and this is cathartic so do it just to make yourself feel better list out all the things you're uncertain about and guess what you're going to find are you certain about nothing there's no facts it's all estimates right but after you've listed every conceivable thing that you're worried about I want you to start putting things into buckets what are you talking about here's your first choice is it estimation uncertainty or is it economic uncertainty estimation uncertainties uncertainty a few because you haven't collected enough data so you don't know how many electric cars are sold right now that's estimation uncertainty you go dig you can find that information somewhere estimation uncertainty uncertainty you can reduce by doing more work collecting more data economic uncertainty basically it's about the future what percentage of the automobile Market in 2032 will be electric you can do some research but the bulk of this is out of your hands right it'll depend on the price of oil it depend on what governments do who knows you know people's States technology shifts here's why I want you to separate the two estimation uncertainty I said you could reduce by collecting more data doing more research you know what happens to economic uncertainty as you do more research you actually get more answered there's a time in valuation I call this the karmic point where you basically say I've done all I can I need to move on I want you to recognize that point because otherwise you're going to frustrate yourself trying to collect data so stop using Google search there's a point at which it gets counterproductive and it's a really it's much sooner than you think economic uncertainties out of your hands it's kind of let go 90 of the uncertainty we Face evaluation is economic uncertainty that's why spending days that people ask me aren't you spending three weeks on a valuation no after 24 hours that really it's counterproduct there's nothing I'm learning by collecting more data at this point it's just to make myself feel better estimation versus economic uncertainty the uncertainty can be micro uncertainty or macro uncertainty Micron certainties uncertain you feel about the company the case of Tesla what are all the things you're uncertain about what Lilo and must do tomorrow what about day after tomorrow will the Shanghai plant be allowed to open in six months micro uncertainty what's macro uncertain what will inflation do what what will happen to oil prices he's saying why bother macro uncertainties are the only uncertainties you build into this contracts you know why because micro uncertainties cut in different directions for different companies foreign large numbers and statistics I pick 100 companies the micro uncertainties 50 companies will do better than I expected 50 will do worse than expected things will average up macro uncertainties don't average out because they're all cut in the same direction if the economy goes into recession I don't care whether you have 10 companies or 100 companies in your portfolio you're going to feel the pain so macro uncertainty is going to discard so when people talk about adjusting the discount rate for the musk effect they're missing the point it's not designed for that kind of risk and finally you have discrete uncertainty versus continuous uncertainty I'll give you the easiest way to see The Divide let's say a U.S company with revenues in a country with fixed exchange rates there are fewer and fewer countries but this is true you fix exchange rates you know what's what's true right every day you wake up you look they look at the exchange rate it's the same as it was the day before this is good right there's no uncertainty there's no uncertainty there's no uncertainty and then one day you wake up and what do you see an 80 devaluation that's discrete uncertainty in contrast think of a U.S company with revenues in Europe every time the dollar euro exchange rate changes your cash flows are changing right continuous every second of every day as a as a business which of these two uncertainties you think are easier to incorporate into your analysis and plan for continuous and discrete uncertainties almost everything in finance is built around continuous uncertainties but very good all others can return models and finance they're really about continuous uncertainties the uncertainties were not very good at are dealing with a discrete like bankruptcy nationalization a CEO going into rehab regulation but terrible at dealing with it because we're using the wrong tools the tools we need are statistical tools right what's the likelihood of it happening this class we're going to talk about both continuous and discrete uncertainties and I'm going to argue that discounted cash flow evaluation is practiced now often ignores discrete uncertainties that you're overvaluing startups you know what even if you do everything right you know what you're missing what happens to two-thirds of startups they don't make it you can't adjust the discount rate for it it's not designed for it so continuous and discrete go ahead because your investment is part of a portfolio this is why the next thing we're going to talk about when you look at risk you got to look at the risk Through The Eyes of the module invest in the company if you have all your money in Tesla God help you then you have no choice I think I'm exposed to micro but that was a choice you made and guess what the market doesn't reward people for making bad choices we can come back and talk about what is what we do and this is not true but when you look at risk at least in terms of how we think about risk how we think about risk in valuation is we're going to make a contention I'll back it up that not all risk gets built into discount rates because if you're a diversified investor I'm not talking about somebody with 5 000 different companies 15 20 25 companies the way you think about risk has to be different than somebody puts all the money in one company that's why micro uncertainties don't get built into this contracts you're saying what if I'm a private business owner I'm putting all my wealth in the company then you have a point then micro uncertainties have to come into this contracts we'll talk about mechanisms but in general bringing micro uncertainties into discount rates for publicly traded companies is asking to be rewarded for something it shouldn't be rewarded for I'll give the analogy really stupid one but take it let's say you buy a house across a six-lane highway and your brokerage house where you trade is across the highway so every morning here's what you do you wake up you drink a lot of coffee and then you run across the six Lane Highway very busy highway to make it to the brokerage house and then you say look you know I take a lot of risk every day I should get at least a 50 return in my portfolio you know what the answer to that is going to be right live on the other side of the highway next to the brokerage house this is your fault and when people are not undiversified demand to get rewarded for micro risk and publicly traded companies say look you made your choice but don't expect the market reward you for it maybe you're so good at assessing companies you can make up for that risk but that risk is still there so not all risk counts and when we think about the risk in a company I don't mean to belittle you but it's not your risk or my risk that we should be thinking about it's the risk of the marginal investor in the company he said who the heck is a marginal investor the marginal investor is the investor who sets prices I don't affect prices when I buy a thousand shares of Apple no matter how wish how much I wish upon that trade it doesn't change the price so to be a marginal investor you need to own millions of shares not thousands of shares and trade those shares so if I took Apple who do you think the marginal investor Annapolis it's not you it's not me it's not an individual it's probably BlackRock or Vanguard or State Street it's an institution follow up is Apple the only company I put for I hope not or they're very strange institution the investors who price stocks tend to be investors with multiple stocks in their portfolio Diversified portfolios but that's going to be different in Tesla not really it's not like Elon Musk is trading millions of shares every day the price of Tesla is being driven by institutional investors just like apple is because they're the ones setting the price each year so when we look at risk we look at the risk Through The Eyes of marginal investors who are Diversified and at least running publicly traded companies that's why we stay with only that part of the risk you cannot diversify away that's why I said micro risk inflation interest rates real GDP growth and how it shows up in your discount rate I am not going to spend you know even more than a couple of minutes on risk and return models because I have bigger fish to fry but every risk and return model in finance is built on what I just said the assumption that investors are Diversified the only difference then becomes how do you measure non-diversifiable risk in the oldest and perhaps still the most used risk and return modern Finance at capab we make the assumption that investors are supremely Diversified the marginal investors you know why we do that because in the cap and we make two assumptions and to see what those two assumptions are think of why most investors stop diversifying even those who are not stuck because think of the two reasons you stop one is there's a transactions cost right it's tiny but as you get more and more people stocks in your portfolio the marginal benefits of adding that stock become smaller and smaller so there's a and if you're a stock picker you also think you can pick the right stocks right so the two reasons we stopped diversifying are transactions costs and we think we can pick stocks you know the cap M assumes no transactions costs and what did euphemistically calls no private information which is you have no idea what's cheap what's expensive if I take the two restrictions away in the cap M you know what your portfolio is going to look like right you're going to keep adding and adding and adding until you have a little bit of every single traded asset in the market in your portfolio sounds absurd but think of it as an index fund that owns a little piece of everything we're not that far away from having something like that accessible right I think there's a Vanguard Global index fund that has like 5 000 companies in it you can conceive of an index one that owns a small piece of everything in the world and you invest in that Index right it's actually the rational way to invest if you have no private information there are no transactions costs in the captain that's where you end up what should we call that portfolio that has everything in the market well let's call it the market portfolio what a creative title we all end up holding the market portfolio so in the Kappa guess how we measure risk we measure risk as a risk added to that market portfolio and it's captured to our number a beta every time you use betas remember you're carrying all of that baggage of no transactions cost no private information with you but it does give us this compact model risk-free rate plus beta times I'm going to call that number in the brackets in equity risk premium Captain Kmart 1964 since then of course there have been other models the Arbitrage model pricing model the multi-factor model they're all variants of the same thing the only difference is instead of having one beta they might have five betas in the Arbitrage pricing model the factors are unspecified now multi-factor model the factors are specified but the end game is the same you have a risk-free rate plus a red Meister of relative risk that's what beta is and a risk premium either for one market portfolio for each factor system but every one of these models starts with a risk-free rate later on we'll come back and talk about betas and risk premium but let's start with the risk reading so in the cabin you need a risk Predator the Arbitrage pricing model you need a risk credit and in every one of these models you need measures of relative risk and Equity risk premiums so our task is laid out for us right to build up to a discount rate we need a risk-free rate we need measures of relative risk obedience if you prefer to call them and we need measures of equity risk periods so I'm going to start at the very simplistic definition of what it has created on a risk create you're going to know exactly what you're going to make guaranteed let me repeat that again when you invest in something risk-free you know exactly what you're going to make to show you the connection between risk-free rates and time Horizon first for something to be risk-free there can be no default risk in it not even an Iota default risk because something can default you're not guaranteed the return so let's say this is a default free entity let's make the U.S treasury for the moment assume it's default free let's say over one year time arrives you buy a one year table right now I think the rate is 4.37 percent so today you buy the table in fact I put some of mine in people's yesterday at 4.37 a year from now I come and knock on your door and ask you what did you make on the table what's your answer going to be 0.37 percent said risk free investment but let's say today you bought a 10-year t-bought right three point eight eight percent three point nine percent or whatever it's at now that's the interest rate right now I come back one year from now and knock on your door and say what did you make on the t-bond part of the return is guaranteed right the coupon but what's the part that's out of your control what could happen to a 10-year t-bond over the next year if interest rates change what happens the price of your bond remember there's a remaining life on the bond there is this Legend of U.S treasuries Being A Safe Haven I've heard this enough that I It terrifies me because there are people who say I put my mind in U.S Treasures everything is safe you know what U.S the U.S 10-year t-bond had his return last year the so-called safe haven so nobody's read my data update three yet is What minus 18 percent the worst year in history for the 10-year teapot why you started the year at 1.5 t-bond rates you ended the year at 3.88 t-bond rates think of the repricing effect it actually stocks were down 18 doesn't return stocks Bonds were down 18 as well that's why you had a 60 40 70 30 80 20 portfolio it doesn't matter right minus 18 minus 18 what does it care what the weights are on the two so what I'm trying to say is for something to be risk-free there can be no default risk you can also have no reinvestment rates if you have a 10-year cash flow don't be using cables to Discount that it's not risk-free because if you use a table you know what you'll make for the next three months but then you have to roll it over at rate you don't know now so return your cash flow you want uh a 10-year preferably zero coupon Bond right because if you have coupons and you've got to worry about reinvestment you can already see that risk-free is not that simple even if there's a default free entity around so first time Horizon matter so when you ask me what the risk free rate is I'm going to refuse to answer until you tell me over what period you want to risk free rate for the next year I'm going to give you a different answer then it is created for the next 10 years second if you ask my address free rate we said what currency oh Turkish lira I'm going to give you a very different answer if it's Turkish lira then if it's U.S dollars and third we've been trained and this is true when I was taught Finance it's true still in many classrooms that if you have a government bond rate in a currency that it is default free is that true though what is the logic that's given for why government bonds in the local currency are default free why is the Indian government viewed as default free when it borrows in Indian rupees they can print more money that's the logic that's always been used for explaining why Government Bond rates are default free but that's an empirical question right they can but they might not you know that half of all Sovereign defaults in the last decade I'm sorry last 50 years have come on local currency government bonds the Russian government in the late 90s defaulted on its Russian Ruble bonds and paid off its dollar Bond tells you something about how the Russian government views its own domestic borrowers but that's a story for a different day but companies fault even if they issue Bonds in the local currency why might that be if it's you know it's so easy to pay off the debt why would you choose to default when you can print the money and pay off the debt yes if you print the money and pay off the debt it's true you've avoided default but you've debased your currency right and here is the Practical question what's easier to come back from because a government that defaults is damaged but a government that debases is also damaged I'll give you an example of how much damage inflation does in the late 90s 1997 was the first time I went to Brazil I did a valuation seminar two days the only question anybody asked through the entire two days was about inflation nobody wanted to talk about companies returns and capital you know what's the inflation now you know why because in the early 90s Brazil had hyperinflation 5 500 inflation and people basically lost faith lost Trust and the way this manifested itself was no Brazilian entity including the Brazilian government was able to issue long-term Bonds in realize for almost 15 years after hyperinflation because would you want to buy a 10-year bond issued by a government in realism and you've been burnt but nobody wanted to it took the Brazilian government I think 2006 or 2007 was the first time the Brazilian government issued now rear denominated bonds coming back from currency debasement is really difficult people because remember fiat currency what do you have you have a piece of paper in your hat what's behind it a Central Bank of the government if you trust neither you're saying that's just a piece of paper I actually have a hundred trillion dollar note don't get too excited it's Zimbabwe in dollars no I think I might still have it here looks great they I think for purposes of Glamor is what it looks like 100 trillion dollars I almost did that remember that example where I put it in the north if I put in how much would you pay for that foreign it was worth about 40 sets four years ago it's worth nothing now that's what happens in inflation 100 trillion when you have 100 trillion on a note you know you've lost the script right you imagine going into a store you buy groceries and they say that'll be 500 trillion today it'll make you feel really rich to be dishing it out no but you're poverty stricken you're living in a hut you could basically can't make it it takes a long time to come back from the basement it took them 15 years in contrast think of Argentina in any just word nobody should ever lend to Argentina ever again right this is a country that manages to find a way to do forward every five years but I remember 2016 I was invited to this Equity investors conference portfolio managed from around the world it was the third or the fourth coming of Argentina that I've seen in this Century we're back again four years later you default again we're back again you know what Latin America has taught us about inflation and everything we know about inflation we've learned from Latin America it's easier to come back from default than it is to come from the basement and countries have taken that to heart which effectively means that Government Bond rates are not necessarily risk-free so here's what I'm going to do to kind of disentangle this credits I'm going to give you a series of tests and I want you to think of the answer and each of them is pretty common sense as we go along think of the answer and along the way we'll encounter every conceivable question you could run into with risk credits so let's say you're doing a valuation remember in evaluation you're projecting cash flows not just for the next five years or ten years but what do we do after you attend that cash flows continue forever really long term you're trying to come up with a risk-free rate to value a company in U.S dollars you've done your cash flows on evaluation I'm going to give you choices and you tell me as I go through whether this would be a choice as a risk reader a three-month label right what's wrong with it your duration mismatching right your cash flows are forever three month table rate a table rate should never ever be used in the DC evaluation about one in five DCFS that I see use the table rate as a risk credit already you've lost the script shouldn't be there what about a 10-year t-bond rate a little better right but if you give it a choice there's also a 30-year Bond and that seems like it's even better because your cash flows don't stop at your tenant go on forever if I had to just pick a risk-free rate in US Dollars and that was my only estimation challenge I'd go with the 30 year bond but as you look at all the valuations I will do this semester I'm going to stay with the tenure barn and there are two reasons the 10-year bond is always the freshest of the long-term months it's the one bond that gets auctioned off every Monday it's the most traded of the bonds the 30 upon some strange things happen it attracts you know Japanese insurance companies that want to lock in coupons you often get this strange quirk and there's a second reason why I stay with the tenure boss this is just the start of my process after I get a risky rate what do I need to estimate default spreads Equity risk premiums and I have to estimate them relative to my risk free rate you know how I get default spreads I look at corporate bonds and then I compare the rates on those corporate bonds to a t Bond if I make my 30 my risk credit Bond I have to find 30 year corporate bonds that's really difficult to do my estimation life becomes a lot simpler if I go with a 10-year bond so I'm going to stay with the 10-year bond and if you made if you were insisted that you want to use a 30 year bond I'm going to let you go ahead and deal with adjusting the risk premiums and default prints it can be done but I'm going to stay with the 10-year boundary you know the tip shade is right it's an inflation-protected treasury bond right now it's about 1.5 percent why would people buy 1.5 percent tips when you can buy a 3.88 t-bond what do you get with the tips how does it work you get the bond you get a one and a half percent rate you know but what you get actually as a coupon each year if your inflation is three percent that year you get one and a half plus three percent four and a half percent if it's eight percent you get nine and a half percent as your coupon it's a real Ray file that away right now I don't want to use it because my valuation is a nominal dollars but maybe when I do a real valuation remember I want to take inflation out this could come into play as for choices enf please don't go there don't sit there said this is a highest number I want to be conservative no this is not the way the world that valuation is supposed to work you can't pick the highest number or the lowest number because there's nothing holding you apart other than maximizing or minimizing the discount rate so if I'm doing a valuation in US Dollars I'm going to go with a 10-year t-bond rate and the only reason I use the 10 versus the 30 is because the rest of my estimation gets easier any questions but while I'm doing all of this am I making an assumption about the U.S treasury and default I am right what's the Assumption I'm making you're not good at fault that used to be an easy assumption 15 years ago now it's debatable right in fact in 2012 it became a very open question to debate because SNP lowered the rating for the U.S from AAA to double a not a terrible rating still a really good rating but they opened the door saying you know what there could be default risk here and now of course there's talk of you know the next debt limit coming so hey you there might be a time I mean I might not be able to use any of these treasury rates as risk free because there might be defaulters we'll talk about what to do then but for the moment we're implicitly assuming that the U.S treasury will not default yes we'll come back today I mean clearly that's not if it's risk-free that wouldn't come in right there's 100 probability that's why you called it risk rate implicitly anytime you do an expected cash flow we are taking expectations across scenarios but remember the world is not a discreet place it's a continuous place right it's not like I can say the world has three scenarios deep recession shallow recession recovery so the problem with probability scenarios they're designed for so brexit we can talk about probabilities but when you talk about the economy we have a Continuum from minus three percent to plus three percent for the economy it's really a continuous distribution if you ask me why do we not bring in distributions we could in fact we will when we do multicolor simulations we will bring entire distributions but don't assume that that's going to make evaluations better again it'll force you to face up to your uncertainty and that's all it'll do but it's not going to qualitatively make your valuations better it's just going to give you a bit much better sense of the range you have around your back okay let's move to the second test anybody planning to Value European company let me be a specific company in Euros a German company a Greek company a Spanish company nobody yeah who you value don't worry I would put you on the spot a Portuguese company or Porsche so Porsche German company right surely a multinational that happens to be part good company to Value so you want to Value the company in Euros you project the cash flows and Euros you need a risk-free rate in Euros right so you go looking for a government bond rate in yours the only problem is you have a luxury of riches here you have a dozen different governments all of whom issued tenure Bonds denominated in euros and the rates are all different so let me put you on the spot which of these rates would you use as your risk credit here you got it got convenient German company jump but did you pick the German rate because your company is German what if your Porsche were a Spanish company my questions are always good I'd like to take that you see where I'm going right it's it's in Euros why are these rates different in different what do different governments have different rates why does the great government have a higher 10-year rate than the German government there is default risk right and what do we say about it risk credit it cannot have default so you know what I would use the German Euro bond rate as my risky rate whether I'm having a Spanish company a Greek company or a German company I know part of you saying but I want to punish this company for being Greek I'll give you plenty of chances to do that don't do it in the risk credit so you value company in euros just take the German Euro bond rate and not because it's German 10 years from now if the Portuguese Euro bond rate is the lowest Miracles can happen you do the Portuguese tenure bond rate it's the lowest of the 10-year bond rates in euros that's up the end any of you adding Indian companies in Indian rupees so nobody wants to put their hand up you're planning to Value an Indian company who you're planning to value Reliance okay good luck with that no it's like Ambani with a different twists on it so let's let's synchronize you want to Value company rupees you need an Indian repeater's credit the Indian government does have a 10-year bond denominated in rupees in fact at the start of 2023 the rate on that Bond was 7.34 percent it's good right I've got my risk created but before I use it as a risk created what do I need to check is there default risk in that Bond remember it's the governments can't afford and here I'm going to cheat not a macro Economist I can't sit there assessing default risk so I went to Moody's not the sharpest knife in the door but at least the numbers are free to get but they have Sovereign ratings for every country you know how they rate companies they're at countries and actually they report two ratings for every country a local currency rating and a foreign currency rate the foreign currency rating is the risk they see in India when it borrows in dollars or Euros to Japanese Yen the local currency rating is the rate reporters they see in India when it borrows in rupees I hoped and I prayed that I would see a triple A rating if I had you know what I'd have done I'd have used a 7.34 as my risk created rupees and blame Moody's if something went wrong what I saw instead was a b double a three rating much better than rating than it used to be 20 years ago but what is Moody's telling me there is default risk in this Bond the 7.34 is not a default free rate in terms of an algebra problem I have a government bond rate but it's not default free to make it default free what do I need to do I need to take out the portion of that rate that's due to default risk I'll take you through a a longer journey and how to come up with this default spread but the default spread that I came up with in early 2023 for this Bond was 2.69 based on the rating so bwa3 rated Sovereign bond has a 2.69 default spread theoretic have the government bond rate 7.434 I have a default spread of 2.69 my objective is to come up with a risk-free rate in rupees and I'll give you the choices I can be stubborn and so I'm just going to use the 7.34 which is what 90 percent of Indian analysts do it is the government boundary it's a Government Bond it's almost unpatriotic somebody accused me of being so well how come you're being so unpatriot I said this is nothing to do with patriotic if I have to worry about default risk it doesn't matter whether an Indian I default to it no it doesn't matter who's defaulting I'd say Indian German I still don't get my money back but that's a stubborn Outlook you take this I could add the 2.69 percent to the 7.34 percent could that make sense sounds like I'm double counting right or I could take the 2.69 percent out which would give me a risk free rate in rupees of 4.65 percent that's what I'm going to do my risk-free rate at the start of 2023 in Indian Rupees is 4.65 percent do you know why I do this because if I don't do this I think we're going to end up double County countries if I use the 7.34 and I call it the risk-free rate you know when I get to my Equity risk premium what you're going to be tempted to do is it's an Indian company I'm going to use a higher Equity risk premium this is my process for keeping risk where it's supposed to be the risk premium and the risk-free rate cleans up for the divorce so let's talk a little bit about that spread right because without that spread you can't come up with a risk credit yep you don't have to right the question that's a good question why am I not doing this why not take the Greek default spread and net it out of the Greek Euro bond to come up with the risk credit because it's actually a default free entity that's issuing the bond it's the same reason we asked me for a risk-free rate in US dollars because you're buying a Brazilian company I'm going to not take the Brazilian government denominated and dollars and subtract out of spread I'm just going to go directly to the risk credit so if you can have an entity which is AAA rated that issuing bonds to the currency you're home free it's only if you don't that you have to do this cleaning up so let's talk about how you can come up with this is that 2.69 came out of right field left field Middle Field somewhere from out there so where do you come up with that so I'll give you the three ways which you can get default default spreads one is if your country issues dollar or Euro denominated bonds you compare the rate on that bond to a USD Bond and that difference would be a default spread the German government the British Brazilian government for instance issues dollar denominated bonds ten year bonds I compare that rate so that gives me a risk rate a default spread that's a first the second and this is a fairly recent development I'm sorry I'll come to you in the last 20 years you have a market called The Sovereign CDs Market fancy name for a market where you can go by insurance against default risk if you buy a Brazilian Bond or an Indian bond so think of it as a market set estimate of the default spread in the country so Sovereign CDs spreads you can observe what the spread is for India that becomes your default spread for the country and the third is you cannot get the first two you can tell me a rating for the country I created a lookup table based on other countries with similar ratings and said this is what the typical spread looks like so I'll go through all three with the Brazilian government so you can see what it works out to but get a question I'm sorry oh sorry that's good so let's take Brazil let's suppose your job is to assess the default spread for Brazil so that you can use it to come up with the risk-free rate and reaction my first stop is I go find a Dollar denominated Brazilian bond this started 2023 the dollar denominated bond is 6.15 the t-bond on that same day was 3.88 they're both dollar bonds 10-year bonds one is uh has default risk the other doesn't the difference between those two 2.27 percent becomes the default spread for Brazil based on a dollar denominator so file that away the first approach to measuring default spread for Brazil gives me 2.27 but for this to work what has to be true that country has to have either dollar or Euro Bond so if you can compare to something risky a lot of East European countries for instance have Euro bonds that you can compare to the German bond to get a spread if I wanted to get a default for Greek or Greece or Spain I can do it with the German Bond but you need a risk-free entity in that one here's the second The Sovereign CDs Market there are about 75 countries right now on which you can go buy insurance in this market so the way to think about this as I said is the market estimate of what the default spread for a country is at the start of 2023 Brazil Sovereign CDs spread is about 3.52 that's how much you'd have to pay each year so if you're buying a Brazilian Bond you want to buy insurance you go to this Market they'll take away three and a half percent or whatever you earn from this that's actually higher than the 2.27 right we'll talk about why the Sovereign CDs market and the ratings can diverge but at least it started 2023 The Sovereign CDs Market saw a more default risk in Brazil than the ratings agency did but there's one flaw with the Sovereign CDs Market which is it's an insurance Market with counterparty risk you know what counterparty risk is you buy insurance but you're not guaranteed that the insurance will be delivered if the counterparty defaults in fact in 2008 when Lehman when bankrupt is a big problem because they were a big player in the Sovereign CDs Market they'd sold Insurance in fact a lot of good debt does you'd have bought insurance from Lehman for the 2008 crisis so the way what that all also means is a spread you're getting might not actually be default there's there's noise there's and here's the kind of shortcut that I used to clean up for the noise according to the Sovereign CDs Market there isn't a risk-free entity in the world there is no country with a zero Sovereign CDs spread I think the country with the lowest Sovereign CD expert might be Switzerland at that time I did this 0.17 but even Switzerland is part about default risk and switch to me that there's some friction in the market that means this number can never drop below so for the last few years here's what I've done to clean up for it I take the US which usually is towards the line in fact started 2023 it was probably higher than it's been historically relative to those to countries like Switzerland or the Netherlands I take the U.S spread and I subtracted it out from The Sovereign CDs prayer saying look part of this is friction I want to get rid of it so we clean up for it the spread you come up with for Brazil is 3.2 3.52 minus 0.32 so somebody keeping track two point two seven percent from the Government Bond three point five two percent if I want to go with the just the Sovereign CDs spread 3.2 percent if I go to this cleaned up CDs prep which brings me to the last where you could get a default spread remember I said there were 75 countries for which there are sovereign CDs spreads there are about 180 countries in the world Maybe 200. there are lots of countries for which I cannot get a sovereign CDs spread there are no dollar bonds I'm kind of lost right India for instance doesn't have dollar denominated bonds it and it did not have Sovereign CDs spreads until about five years ago but it have a rating so there would be countries where you can get a sovereign rating but you can't get the other two and if you can give me the Sovereign rating for your country I can tell you based on the start of 2023 other countries with similar ratings what the default spread should be and a ba2 rated rating which is what Brazil had would give me a default spread of 3.68 percent so 2.27 for the Government Bond Market 3.2 percent from the CDs Market 3.68 based on the rate the Brazilian uh 10-year re-i bond I think had raped now we'll come back and talk but it had a rate of like 10.5 11 which of these three numbers you subtract I will give you a very different discrete rate but I'm going to say something very weird doesn't matter which one you pick just stay consistent if you lower numbers your risk-free rate will be higher but that number will now become part of your Equity risk premium so whatever you pick will have opposite effects in your risk-free rate and risk premium but what will get you into trouble is we use two different measures of default threads one for your risk free rate and one for the risk brain what about a real risk-free day I've kind of given away the answer you're doing your analysis in real terms this is nothing to do with dollars or re-ice you want a real risk credit the tips rate is a real risk credit you see but it's in dollars no no there is no Dollar in a real right it's a real risk credit the currency kind of dissipates you put me anywhere in the world and asked me to do evaluation in real terms I'm going to start with a 1.53 but I'll tell you the Assumption I've made that might make you uncomfortable you know why there should be only one real risk free rate across the world because if I'm a real risk free rate of one and a half percent in the US and five percent in Brazil if Capital can flow freely across countries you know what's going to happen right it'll flow out of the U.S Enterprise in a world where Capital flows freely there can be only one real risky rate across ago but practically we know Capital doesn't flow freely so when you go into a small emerging market with barriers to Capital here in Myanmar you could have a real risk created a four or five or six percent which is disconnected from the global railroads free day but in most of the world you can use the tips rate as you just create I'm going to leave I'm going to stop there but uh when we start on on um Monday we'll talk more about what else drives the risperer foreign thank you foreign last time thank you um I was thinking about what if all this ratings 
foreign yeah foreign I don't know um foreign okay folks I I always get ragged about this one it's too much noise they always get dragged about wearing a non-nyu sweatshirt but you know what I hate nyu's colors and second there isn't an NYU sports team that I pulled for in my entire lifetime I don't even know whether they have a sports team so uh stick with my UCLA shirt I have a cal shirt you know I might even wear a Notre Dame shirt even though I have nothing to do with it no and Stanford I love the color I mean I've never so I'll wear whatever has a better color and NYU is not not it so don't view this as some kind of you know on patriarch is it the right word even for you know but it's not that I don't care about NYU maybe I don't care about NYU but now don't read that as the message you get from so before we start on today's session I'll give you a preview of what we're going to do we're going to wrap up the risk create section we're going to talk about hey what do you do when rates are really low start of last year t-bond rates or historic lows what do you do when rates are negative now and we'll talk about what you should do and what you should avoid doing and then we're going to talk today about risk premiums risk premiums in the U.S risk and basically we're going to start with Equity riskment what's the price of risk in the equity Market how much do investors charge for investing in equities and I'm going to give you different ways of estimating it and the pluses and minuses but along the way we'll also have to deal with the fact that I think is kind of a reality but people still push back against it the equity risk premium you should demand for investing in some parts of the world are higher than the equity risk premium you should demand for investing in other parts everybody agree with that that if I am a business in the Democratic Republic of the Congo the kind of equity risk premium I will charge will be different than the equity response in South Africa which would be different than the equatorial charge for a Swiss project so I want to talk about how to estimate Equity or screens in different countries and along the way I'm going to pose a question because a lot of valuations seem to assume that risk comes from where you're Incorporated and traded that if you're an Indian company exposed to Indian Country risk Indonesian company Indonesian countries Brazilian company Brazilian country risk and that strikes me as insane why because if you're in forces and you get 90 of your revenues outside India why should I treat you like automotives which might get 70 of its revenues in India Tardis steel that might get 91 percent of its revenues in India risk comes from where you do business rather than where you're Incorporated in trade so I'm going to start the class test it's going to be focused on that risk and how do we measure that operating risk exposure so let's set up the example if an Israeli company headquartered in Tel Aviv that gets 95 of its revenues in the US a lot of Israeli software companies that get the bulk of their revenues in the U.S remember ways which you might use on that Google acquired was an Israelis startup so you have an Israeli company it's a software company 95 of its rate so the question is when you value this company should you be using the Israeli Equity risk premium on the rationale of hey there in Israel that they're Incorporated in Israel or should I use the U.S Equity air script don't be too quick to give the answer think about it because it's going to make a big difference right maybe not so much but in it but if I have for instance a company in India that gets the bulk of its revenues in Europe and North America should I be using risk premiums that reflect where it operates or where it's Incorporated and then I'm going to kind of no as I said I'm not even going to ask you to pick because somewhere in the course of the day we're going to deal with this because you can see that not the logic of using operational risk premiums make sense but at the same time that's still in Israel regulations taxes that are still they're still exposed to those and all the software Engineers live in Tel Aviv you see that when you talk about operating risk exposure you can talk about revenues that's one way to measure it but you can also talk about where do you produce things where are your operations how do you weigh the two when you decide where is my risk exposure let's suppose you have a Nigerian oil company and with the with the software company you could say most of my exposure comes where I sell my stuff therefore my I'm going to measure risk exposure based on revenues you could probably get away with it right because even though your engineers are in Tel Aviv if you really you know if if you felt that Israel was too dangerous a place run your business you could put them all on a couple of planes send them to a different location your production is movable irrelevant but let's change the facts let's suppose your Nigerian oil company your headquartered in logos all of your reserves are in Nigeria all your oil is sold into a global oil markets and some Revenue level you can say look my exposure is you know I'm just another oil company is the way we think about operating risk going to be different when you have a natural resource company as opposed to a consumer product company I think you already can reason your way to an answer right because with an oil company if you're a Nigerian oil company and Nigeria goes to hell in a handbasket what are you going to do you can pull up your reserves and take them to Switzerland say look I'll put the reserves in Switzerland that's I mean for whatever reason maybe for a good or bad reasons God's decided to put oil in the riskiest parts of the world and say go get it right in this case you could argue that the way we measure operating risk exposure not based on where you sell your product but based on where you extract your aramco even though it's a global oil company is so closely tied to Saudi Arabian country race that you don't know where the company stops and where the country begins it's going to be one of the valuations of the week I'll throw up is their original IPO evaluation that I did because it's going to force you to wrestle with things like you know how do I think about political risk in a country I mean something that came up with the adani group it's a naraco it's Central to the question right what do you think about the Saudi royal family and it's longevity is going to affect how much value you attach around and finally just to kind of give you a sense so let's suppose you have an Indian automobile company so now you the software company easy to move things natural resource company impossible to move things but let's think something that's in the middle an automobile company it's factories are in India it sells most of its stuff outside India are you kind of mixed exposure right part of it is where do you sell your stuff the other part is your operations are not easily mobile they're not as stuck as they are with natural You could argue that I should look at both my revenues and where my production is so practically these are things you're going to face so when you pick a company I want you to think about where does the risk in this company come from it's come from where I sell my stuff where I make my stuff because that's going to have consequences for how you think about Equity risk premiums for your company so let's put this away because we you know I want to go wrap up the risk-free rate discussion before we move on to how to measure Equity risk privilege so if you remember in the last class we went through the mechanics of estimating risk credit some currencies was easy right just take the government bond rate user t-bond rate Swiss Government Bond rate what do they share in common they were viewed as default free so you could use the government bond rate as risk-free then we talked about the Indian rupee rescreate and we said you can't use the government bond rate you got to clean up for the fact that there's default risk in there and you took the difference so if you get a chance watch the valuation tools webcast from last week because I take you through the process of cleaning up those rates where you get those rates let's say you've done that though you've taken every currency in which there's a Government Bond and I'll tell you upfront not all currencies the government Bots only about 45 currencies have a Government Bond you cleaned up the Government Bond for default risk and you come up with risk credit see this blue portion of the column at the start of 2023 these were the risk-free rates in different currencies so I'm going to start with a statement that the chart actually should make clear but I'll State It Anyway risk-free rates are different in different currencies there are some currencies where discrete rates are high like the zombie and kwacha there's some currencies where discrete rates are low and some currencies with the risk-free rates can actually be negative so you ready for the question if you can answer this question you've cracked the currency code some of you already gave me this answer last session but let's bring it to the surface why do risk-free rates vary across currencies notice I didn't ask you why do government bonds vary across currencies because you can do dances about it's a risky government now let's say you cleaned up for risk it's a true risk credit why do risk-free rates vary across currencies anybody want to give that a try you want to try for the risk period it's very cross-currencies you look like you had the answer so I'm going to pick on you now maybe you were just brushing a mustache no yeah no wait wait I've cleaned up for that right because these are restricted Government Bond rates that could be the explanation right but let's have cleaned up for the default risk I've come up with risk credits you want to give that a try challenge of economic growth yeah but you know in let's say growth out of the equation because you know countries feed into Global growth but what's the other thing you mentioned so let's be very clear once you've cleaned up a default risk the big reason for differences in risk-free rates across currencies is inflation High inflation currencies have high risk free rates low inflation currencies have low risk free rates and deflationary currencies could have negative risk periodage so people are wondering how the heck and rates turn risk-free you could have a very strange set of circumstances you've got a deflation and low real growth and risky rates can turn negative now I'm going to say something that's going to sound absurd but I'll back it up more substantially later in the class but you can probably start to see the intuition right now if you do a good valuation it should be currency invariant you know what I mean by that you take a Nigerian company valued in naira you should get exactly the same value as if you took that same company and valued entirely in US dollars the reason is actually very simple if you pick a high inflation currency to do your valuation tell me what's going to happen to your discount rates they're all going to be high right so if you value a company in zombie and quacher don't be surprised to see 25 27 28 discount rates same thing with Turkish lira you very quickly start to hit 25 discount rates and it'll freak you out especially if you're from a low interest rate environment but then when you do your cash flows remember they have to be in the same currency the wind is now in your back right so when you estimate growth in a high inflation currency even if you're a low Growth Company in nominal terms you're going to see 12 15 18 growth so you're going to have high discount rates and high growth rate in your cash flows you're going to come up with the value that reflects now you take the same company and you value it in a low inflation currency first you discount rate is going to drop why because you've chosen a low inflation currency but before you celebrate too much when you estimate your cash flows your growth rate now has to be in U.S dollars or Euros right so that 15 growth rate you used has to become four or five six percent growth rate what one hand gives you the other hand will take away you can already see why people get into trouble with currencies right I still remember student of this class from like 20 years ago 25 years ago he's now the CFO of a very large US company I won't name the company or the student because it might embarrass him so he calls me a few years ago and he's you know he clearly wants to Crow about how much he remembers the class he said you know I am the CF of a company we just did an acquisition of an Indian company and I remembered your class and I said what exactly did you remember he said you know we talked about currency so basically we decided to Value the Indian company in US Dollars we can do that right I said yeah you can value any company in any currency currency is just a measurement mechanism he said when we built up discount rates we started the t-bond rate he was very happy about the fact that he started the right riskery right he said I bring country risk I've come up with a you know dollar cost to Capital I said congratulations and he said we estimate the cash flows in dollars I said how did you do that he said we took last year's rupee numbers and converted them into dollars that's easy enough then he said we estimated growth rate I said where do you get the growth rate he said we asked our Indian managers how quickly the company would grow let me ask you a question if you ask an Indian analyst or an Indian manager about growth rates what currency do they frame the growth rate rupees right it's not that they're being deceptive you think in the currency that you live in every day so I asked him in did you ask in what currency he said should I I said you probably should because you probably paid three times what you should have for the company do you see why if I take my cash flows and rupees and at that time the rupee inflation rate was eight or nine percent I put in that growth rate and then I discount those cash flows with a discount rate that reflects a one percent inflation rate I'm going to explode the value of the company for all the wrong reasons mismatching currencies can cause your valuations to implode pick a currency any currency but then stay consistent so when you think about risk-free rates think about inflation because that is in fact the driving force now a couple of years go ahead okay let's go there right but the other thing I could do I could take the repeat cash flows and convert them into dollar cash flows using an expected exchange rate right how do I get expected accelerates remember purchasing power parity because remember these are not markets you're going to get forward rates for the next 20 years what's purchasing power parity of one currency with a nine percent inflation rate the other currency is a one percent inflation rate over time what's going to happen to the higher inflation currency come on you remember purchasing power parity it's going to depreciate by roughly eight percent a year so if you decide to do your cash flows in dollars you inflation is is the culprit either way right whether it's you're doing it at the discount rate or an expected exchange rates but you have to use expected exchange rates you can't use today's exchange rate every year for the next debt and expect to get any kind of sensible valuation now of course when you do valuation this is one of the few comfortable spaces right when you do a risk free rate this number doesn't change very much and that's true if you're in the U.S or Europe if you're in Turkey forget about it your history rate could shift on a daily basis but one of the things we're taught is a risk free rates don't change very much in mature markets most of the time that is true but I'll take you back to 2020. a year we will all never forget right but kovit took away the last year of your high school or the first year of college whichever it was first quarter 2020. take a look at what happened to treasury rents they implode it started the year t-bond rate was at one and a half percent by by the time you go through and you look at where we are three months later t-bond rates are at 0.76 percent table rates are there at one percent dropped to zero percent why because real things were happening right the entire global economy had shut down you weren't sure where we were whether we were coming back risk-free rates collapsed in three months in contrast think about 2022 what happened to rates they Rose in the other direction right you started the Earth one and a half percent you ended the year at 3.88 so what you value a company on January 1st of 2022 and you come up with a vet you value the same company nothing changes about the company same cash flow same growth rate will you get a different value nine months later absolutely this notion that intrinsic value some magical number that stays fixed over time is absurd because the world is Shifting around you so if you do your valuation on February 15 because you want to get the project done quickly you're on top of it you finish the valuation could that valuation change by May absolutely you're saying does this mean I have to revalue the company every now you can you know my suggestion is you have an input page keep it separate things like the t-bond rate definitely keep it as an input that just gets copied from the input page maybe even connect your input page directly to Yahoo finance you can do that right the t-bond rate gets updated automatically those numbers will shift on you because that's the way the world Works your cost of capital can change your cost of equity can change and complaining about it that it's changing can't change reality so risk-free rates can change risk free rates differ because of inflation let's complete the risk-free rate process by bringing one final issue I told you there were about 40 plus currencies in which you can get a government bond rate so even the approach that I described you need a government bond rate to get started but they're like 150 currencies in the world there are some currencies but there is no Government Bond rate you think what do I do that you have a couple of choices one is you can give up and value the company in another currency for the longest time in Latin America people valued everything in US Dollars why they didn't trust the real I didn't trust the peso so that's one choice you value a Russian company my suggestion is don't try to Value to droopers right it's already Tough Enough why add this to them the other is you can say look I want to estimate a risk-free rate in the local currency and I'll give you a way in which you can do it and here's what I'm going to do I'm going to go back and think about why risk free rates vary across currencies because of difference in inflation about seven years ago I had to Value an Egyptian bank I didn't have to but I wanted to and I valued an Egyptian pounds because I wanted to deal with the local currency there was no government boundary in Egyptian parts so here's how I got the risk free rate Egyptian pounds I started with the UST bond rate that's a dollar risk free rate you're saying but this is Egyptian punch you're right if I can look at the inflation rate in the U.S and the inflation rate in Egypt let's suppose inflation rate in Egypt is 15 and the inflation rate in the U.S is 2 percent oh 1.5 percent if you're in a hurry just take the difference of 13 and a half percent add it to your t-bond rate you now have an Egyptian pound risk created in other words take the differences in inflation you can get a risk-free rate in any currency there are some of the government bonds on that list I showed you where I don't trust the rent you know why what I mean by don't trust it right the T bond rate whether you like it or not is a traded number there are billions and billions of dollars buying and selling t-bonds so basically it's a number from a market the Pakistani government bond rate I'm not so sure because in many government bonds there is no trading it's actually very it's a rigid Market banks are forced to buy the bond by the so you see where I'm going a government bond rate might sometimes give you a very misleading view of a risk credit if it's not trade the Venezuelan government still insists that it has a 10-year bond with a 13 rate I don't know who's buying this Bond but they claim this is the government bond rate it's nonsensical because your inflation is in the thousands of percent so when you don't trust a government bond rate go this route because this will always work for you now part of you saying but how the heck am I going to forecast inflation in the US it's very easy if you want to forecast expected inflation what can you do it's a market-based rate yeah take the market the t-bond rate take the tips rate that difference is expected inflation you don't need to have economists and macroeconomic Analysis the market-based number that number is about two and a half percent right now long term you're saying how the heck am I going to get the rate in Egypt you estimate it you're saying what if I'm wrong it doesn't matter sounds like an absurd thing to say right let's say the true inflation rate is 80 but you estimated at 15 you underestimated inflation you underestimate the discount rate but then when you do your cash flows if you use the same 15 you've also underestimated the cash flows by exactly the same amount this is incredibly good news because I'm saying as long as you screw up consistently on inflation it's going to average out so next time you find yourself spending days and weeks estimating inflation just stop estimate a number use the same number in your cash flows and your discount rates and you're going to be okay because it's going to cancel out finally said a year ago if you were valuing a U.S company in US Dollars the t-bond rate was at one and a half percent historically that's a low number and the older you are the lower it look you know what I mean by that it's actually Behavioral Studies that show that what you think is normal is actually set between the ages of 30 and 35. so you know so I you know when people say the t-bond rate is too low it as what's a normal t-boundary it's a six percent my reaction is you've been in the markets too long time to retire because you probably started markets in like the 1970s the 80s if you came into markets in the 1990s a normal what I'm saying is people use the word normal as if we all agree on what a normal is but remember it's a reflection of your experiences what you grew through but a lot of people at the start of 2023 looked at the trade said that's too low rate and the minute you say that's too alert lower rate what's the normal way to fix that if something is too low replace it with something more normal and as I said that number can be three four and there's an entire group of appraisers who decided to go this route not just last year but over the last decade they've been playing with normalized risk credits in my view you're playing with fire on a number you shouldn't be playing with let's play this out let's suppose you decide to replace the one and a half percent risk-free rate with a normalized number let's say it's four percent or five percent so let's play out the mechanics you've replaced what's an actual rate with a normalized rate what's going to happen to your discount rate it's going to go up right your discount rate goes up your value is going to go down you evaluate and let's say it goes down enough that it's lower than the price you know why we do this kind of cash flow valuation if something doesn't pass muster we say we have an opportunity here to invest elsewhere when I use a one and a half percent t-bond rate I'm saying look if you don't invest in stocks you can invest elsewhere and make one and a half percent but if you've normalized the rate my question is where are you going to find this five percent risk-free rate that you magically pulled out of nowhere not something you want to mess with you want to normalize margins be my guest your normalized growth of course you can do that but don't normalize risky rates because you don't control that outcome that's an actual opportunity cost today that problem has gone away right he Bond rates are back closer to what people think of as normal but this too shall pass I mean two years from now the rate might be seven and a half percent you're going to feel the urge to normalize in the other direction stop messing with the risk-free rate you got enough on your plate in terms of estimation challenges let the risk-free rate go and if you have negative risk credits no you could and and of course whenever we talk about t-bond rates now who's held responsible for rates being low the fat the fed you only rate the FED sets it's a Fed fund straight it doesn't set treasury rates doesn't no I still remember about uh you know 10 years ago 15 years ago maybe when my kids were still at home I took them into the the FED they actually do a tour of the FED have you ever done it's actually I would say fun but it's not that bad right so you go to the FED building which is right it's downtown you go in and there's a tour guide who takes you around the most exciting part of the whole tour is when you go down and you see the big stacks of currency don't try don't get any strange ideas well protected yeah so I you know I take my son and my daughter and my and my wife we we're going to the FED I almost made myself persona non grata about two minutes into the tour the tour guide comes up nice lady 23 years old 20 feet very young you know very enthusiastic about the Fed so I almost asked the question could you take me to the interest rate room you know and when you watch CNBC you have this mission of Jerome Powell sitting in a room moving things around right the t-bond rate looks too low let me move it up a little bit or the mortgage rates are getting too high no there's no lever out there the all the FED controls is a Fed funds rate the next question I was going to ask her is can you take me to that window I'd like to borrow the FED funds rate you can try it out but you're not going to get to a window and you're definitely not borrowing the FED funds rate it's a rate at which banks borrow overnight that of course this has become mythology the reason rates have been low for the last decade is because the FED has kept them there what do we say Drive service credits inflation so this graph here's what I've done I've actually graphed that the red portion of the column is the inflation every year it goes up and down and the other component that goes into a risk free rate is a real interest rate which can be captured by real growth over time so I've taken the GDP growth teacher so if you add the inflation rate to the GDP growth rate you get what I call an intrinsic risk free range so when inflation is high and real growth is high what's High plus High humor me it's high rates will be high and for the last decade take a look at what happened we had low inflation in anemic growth low plus low is low I'm not telling you the FED doesn't affect rates but the reason rates were low for the last decade is because you had low inflation and low real growth and the FED at the margin could affect it but it if inflation had been five percent for the last decade nothing no qe1 QE2 qe3 whatever you did could have altered that reality so when you think about interest rates don't fall into the Trap of assuming the FED is going to raise rates this year lower I mean you hear this all the time right we're going to have higher rates here how do you know the fed's going to raise rates what rates you know last year the FED chased the market all through the year they raise rates after the fact that you know the reminder of the story of a rooster called shed the clear have you ever heard the story it's actually a fun story it's about a rooster that rules a farm yard and the reason it rules the farmyard is all of the other farm animals think that the roosters crowing is what makes the sun come up so they pay homage to say oh great rooster and for a while rooster rides High then one day the rooster oversleeps his iPhone didn't go off or whatever it was he oversleeped and guess what happened the sun came up anyway the other animal said you're not making the sun come up you happen to crawl at the time the sun comes up I think the same way about the fed the FED doesn't drive raids it kind of if it's sensible actually makes it look like it's controlling rates that's the only way you get power here but rates do change over time and they change over time not because the FED is making them go up and down but because the fundamentals are shifting so rates go up this year or go down that year what's the real question I need to answer to be able to to answer that question about rates what will happen to inflation this year and what will happen to the economy that's a healthy discussion rather than watching the Federal Open Market Committee go through its meetings and finally there are some currencies whether it's created is negative I'm sorry what's your name Ashley is valuing Nintendo Japanese company in Japanese yeah Japanese Yen it's a negative discrete it's had a negative riskery right now it's actually nominally it's positive but because it's defaults you know Japan is not tripoliated anymore you end up with a negative risk credit now part of the reason people are uncomfortable using negative risk free rates is if I use a negative risk credit want my cost to Capital be low absolutely this is the pure math books but if you think about what a negative risk create is telling you about the future it's telling you that there's going to be deflation in the end and even though Nintendo is a global real growth phenomenon when you talk about the big currencies it's not the real growth in that country that gets reflected as much as Global growth kind of showing up in the risk Trading so the long answer the question can I get away using an absolutely you get a low-caustic capital but once you get to growth you're going to have to recognize that you're now operating again it's almost like you're swimming against the tide you have to grow it six percent to show a five percent growth rate so you're going to have to be conservative in your growth rates because that's what the inflation effect is going to be and once you get to the terminal value you talk about growth rate forever I'm going to impose a rule that I'll come back and revisit you should try to cap your growth rate at the risk-free rate and people will complain they say our negative growth well you didn't complain when I gave you a negative risk free rate in a low cost to Capital right this goes back to the question of being internally consistent so don't fight fights you don't have to fight when it comes to risky rate no let the risk-free rate flow through into your discount rate if it's low it's low if it's high it's high just remember your cash flows will now have to reflect whatever your risk-free rate is telling you about the future so let's talk about equity research I'll tell you what we're trying to measure and then I'll take you different ways in which I can try to estimate it and with each one you can tell me whether I you know it's going to work or not you know what I'm trying to estimate the equity risk premium it's what investors are demanding as a premium when they buy equities today over and above the risk credit risk created t-bond rate right now is about three and a half percent when people are buying the S P 500 or they're buying U.S equities they're obviously not settling for three and a half percent as they're expected done they want to make more how much more that's what an equity risk premium captures already you can see that this number is going to reflect the risk aversion of investors as people get more risk covers the premiums are going to get larger it's going to reflect how much risk they see in equities collectively and that's going to shift over time and any good measure of the equity risk premium then has to be dynamic do you see what I mean by Dynamic it's got to change the word survive value of a company in the middle of March of 2020 2020 when covet was shutting the global economy down and everybody was terrified My Equity risk premium should reflect that fear so that's what a good Equity risk premium has to be forward-looking and dynamic I'll tell you how 90 of discounted cash flow evaluations get an equity risk premium and you can decide whether it needs a forward-looking and dynamic test the way most people estimate Equity risk premiums most appraisers most banks is they look backwards they look at the last 50 years the last eight years last 100 years they look at what would have made investing in U.S stocks what would have made investing in U.S treasuries they take that difference and they use that as our Equity risk premium going forward it's called a historical risk premium now what are they drawing on when they do that it's called mean reverse that things revert back to the average powerful force absolutely and if you have an economy that's stable it'll tend to be mean reverting right because things will deviate from the mean and come back and the much of the 20th century that was true for the U.S the most mean reverting economy of all time because it was the global economy between 2022 you think the economy is I mean regarding what me what's the average you're going to revert to so the first problem in historical risk premiums is you're backward looking and assuming that the future will look not just like last year but the last 100 years you're on Dangerous Ground it's backward looking not forward-looking and is it dynamic at the start of 2022 what's the average of the last hundred years going to look like it's not going to change by the middle of the year you got this 99-year number kind of dragging it in towards its backward looking and static are not done let me dig a hole in bury historical risk cream backward looking static and statistically it's got a huge problem in statistics classes when I ask you to estimate an average of 100 numbers you can estimate the average right at 100 divided by 100 then what do you trade to put in Brackets below the average a standard error right you see I've estimated the average but by the way I could be wrong and here's the range on how wrong I could be so let's go back and this is on my on my website I actually made maintain these historical dreams even though I don't use them so let's go back all the way to 1928 that's a long time right 94 years of History the historical risk premium for stocks of wants let's say it's 5.06 second decimal point I must know a lot about risk premiums right but take a look at this number 2.15 that is the standard error in my estimate so think about it I'm telling you the risk premium is about five percent and say oh by the way the standard error is about two percent do you remember enough statistics to give me a Range how does it work with 67 confidence which means you can be wrong about a third of the time right a lot if you want 90 content you got to go two standard errors which means the true risk premium can be anywhere from one to nine percent fat lot of good this does you right and that's with 94 years of History if I go back only 50 years the standard error gets large if I go back 10 years it's almost all noise historical risk premiums are backward looking static and Incredibly noisy but still we see entire valuations built around them so when you look at historical risk premiums factor in the noise recognize that this is not a fact so when people say I got the historical wristbands 5.31 ask them a question what's the standard error and so what's the standard error they've already lost the script right they think a historical number is a fact it's not and there's another problem the only Market in the world on which you got historical data going back 150 200 years is the US much many of the European markets had shut Downs during the second world war so there was you know for continuous returns you got to go to the U.S market and there's a bit of a survivorship bias you get by looking at the U.S market as the basis for his premiers it was one of the most successful Equity markets of the 20th century we know that in hindsight but you wouldn't have known that in 1901 right so 1901 if you took your money and invested you'd have invested a third in the Austrian Market guess what happened to that third it was probably crashed and burned by 1945. so not only are we looking at a backward looking static number that is noisy but we're also taking it out of a market that was in hindsight do you see where this is going if I build this in as My Equity risk premium for the next hundred years I'm assuming the markets I'm investing and are going to be the winners of the 21st century and have no idea so we can play games with this number but the reality is that the number let's skip a page yeah that the historical premium to me is not a great way to estimate it and it gets even worse if I have to estimate this for an emerging market let's say you have to estimate an equity risk premium for Vietnam and you decide that the way to go is to run a historical risk premium how many years of historical data do you think you're going to have in Vietnam 15 years at best Brazil you might have 30 years of reliable returns and then before that who knows what the market looks like even India until the late 80s the market was dominated by a few companies very little Trading so if historical risk premiums are the way you estimate risk greens for markets you're very quickly going to hit a rock trying to estimate this number so I'm going to give you the way I estimate risk agreement I'll use historical risk premium for the moment I'm building off a shaky number but I'll come back and replace that number I'm going to start with the statement that I can't really do historical premiums throughout the markets I have to estimate that risk premiums relative to the US I'm not it's not because I'm being parochial it's because that's the one market where I have enough data to actually start with the number so let's assume you have a restraint for the U.S it could be historical I'll give you an alternative that I think is better but he says risk premium for the U.S 5.94 looks like I pulled that number out of the air but I'll come back and back that number that's my premium for the US and let's say that I have to estimate an equity risk premium for Brazil I know whether you remember when I did the risk-free rate in Brazil India I remember I came up with a measure of the default spread you could use the Government Bond to I'm sorry to 2.27 percent you could use a CDS spread 3.2 percent you could use the rating Base number 3.69 3.68 percent I said don't worry pick a number and be consistent it's going to be okay sounded odd when I said that right because you got very different risk credits depending on which number but I said once you pick a number when you get to the equity risk premium space I'm going to ask you to use the same number whatever makes your risk-free rate higher is going to also make your Equity risk premium slower vice versa the simplest way to think about an equity risk for a country this is the way investment Banks estimate Equity risk for for other countries is they take the U.S Equity rest cream God knows where that comes from and they add the default spread for a country so in Brazil if you decide to go with the rating space spread of 3.68 and your U.S premium is 5.94 5.94 plus 3.68 gives you a risk premium of 9.62 now do you see why I cleaned up your risk free rate for that default spread because if I don't you're going to end up double counting right your risk-free rate or so-called risky rate is going to include that 3.68 and now you're also going to push up the risk premium by exactly the same number so this is the state of the art if you can call it that of getting risk premiums for other countries and it's been around for 30 years and when I first encountered it I had a little bit of an issue with it I said I know default spreads measure risk but they measured risk on a bond this is equity right I said why are we taking this risk that where the spread we're charging for a Government Bond and adding into an equity risk premium so I'll give you two ways around that problem the first is what some investment Banks decide was a solution to this default spread prompt they said let's focus on just equities we don't even want to bring the bond in we know the equity risk premium for the US is 5.94 and we can estimate a standard deviation for U.S equities the s p 500. so let's assume that number is 18 for the S P 500 and 5.94 is a U.S Equity risk rate then they said let's go estimate the standard deviation the bobespa which is the Brazilian Equity index okay that standard deviation is 30 percent remember algebra problems from high school you have an 18 standard deviation marketed charging of 5.94 default spread if the Brazilian markets have a standard deviation of 30 that will make them about 1.67 times more risky 30 divided by 18 than U.S markets so you multiply the 5.94 percent by that 1.67 your Equity restraint becomes 9.90 percent so here you're avoiding the default spread entirely you're basing it on standard deviation of equity markets six this sounds like it's much more reasonable right I actually in the paper that I would send you the link to which is a really long boring paper and Equity risk premiums I take every Market estimate the standard deviation for the market and use this approach you know that the equity risk premium based on this approach for Egypt it's dining because the standard deviation the Egyptian Market is like five percent it sounds strange right because you think Egypt you take a lot of risk when I estimate standard deviation I'm estimating it based on the index level but what causes index levels to move in addition to changes in Risk somebody has to trade right if you have an illiquid Market let's take the extreme scenario let's save a market where there's no trading at all what the index level going to be every day it'll be exactly the same number illiquid markets are going to have low standard deviations with this approach I'm going to underestimate the cost of equity and the equity risk premiums for illiquid markets so first approach it's too rigid I'm just using a default spread the second approach Works in some countries where there's a relatively liquid Equity Market but will fail in a lot of countries which are eloquent so here's the third approach I call this my melded Approach I'm not going to claim it's magical the third approach I bring together both approaches I start with the U.S Equity risk premium just like the first two I look up two standard deviations like like the second approach but there's two standard deviations I look up are the standard deviation are the standard deviation of the bobespa just like in the second approach but instead of looking at standard deviate I'm sorry standard deviation the S and P 500 like the second approach put me back up the standard deviation of the best but like the second approach but instead of looking at the standard deviation of the S P 500 I look at the standard deviation of the Government Bond the Brazilian government Bond remember the 3.94 default spread went with the Government Bond if Brazilian equities are 1.5 times more volatile than Brazilian government bonds I'm going to take the 3.94 spread I had for the bond and scale it up to reflect the higher risk of equities so let's summarize first approach you just take the default spread added on to the US I quoted as Premier dot second approach you take the US Equity restraint look up the standard deviations of the U.S Equity index and the local index and use its scale number the third approach you start with the U.S Equity risk premium you take the default spread of the country and then you bring in the standard deviations of equity and debt in that country the advantage of that is one market is in liquid the other one's going to be a liquid as well so if there's hardly any trading inequities there's going to be hardly any trading in the Government Bond as well you don't get the mismatches you get the second approach will the three approaches give you different numbers absolutely how different depends on the point in time you do this so let's think about expanding it doing this for every country a startup every year I do this for every country that has a rating I'll talk about what I do with the countries without a rating I start with an equity risk premium for the US and I'll come in and fill in that detail but the equity or Screaming I got for the S P 500 the start of 2023 was 5.94 so that's my Equity risk group for the U.S for every country I look up The Sovereign rating for the country why because I don't have the resources to assess country risk in every country I cheat and let Moody's do it for me so what can I see I'll see the rating and can range anywhere from AAA for Germany Singapore Netherlands Australia all the way down to you know Venezuela is what single sea I take the rating and I estimate the default rate remember the lookup table I showed you last session so I have an equity restraint for the US I now have a default spread for each country I want to go with the third approach the third approach though I need a standard deviation in the Government Bond and as I said no that's available for only like 40 countries and even the 40 countries I'm not sure I'm getting a number that's reliable so I cheat and here's how I cheat to get that scaling number on the spread basically how much should I multiply the spread by I look up standard deviations in two indices one is an index of emerging market equities s p maintains this so you can see it on the website and the other is an index of s p Emerging Market public bonds government bonds I take the ratio of those standard deviations start of 2022 2023 that number was 1.41 see what does this all mean let's say you have a country with a two percent default spread you multiply two percent by 1.4 when you get 2.82 percent you add that to the 5.94 percent you get an equity risk premium of 8.77 and I do this for every country take the rating at the default spread multiply by 1.41 very mechanical but by the time I'm done I'm going to get an equity risk premium for every country that has a rating there are 140 countries tradings this is what the world looked like to me at the start of 2023. so let me explain let's start let's start with the easy ones the US the 5.94 I'll come and back up where I get that but I gave the U.S a 5.94 equity risk premium he's saying why is Canada it's the same because if you have a triple A rating you have zero default credit so every AAA rated country in the world has the same Equity risk crimes the U.S and I think that makes sense if you have mature markets it doesn't make sense for you to tell me German markets Equity response four percent the US is seven percent because they're both mature money should flow out of the lower premium Market in the higher premium market so every AAA rated country in the world you'd see zero percent as the country's risk premium and 5.94 is the equity risk but let's pick a part of the world let's take Asia right there's my breakdown of Asia and you can see that across Asia there's only one country with the AAA rating Singapore and Singapore gets the same risk cream as the U.S but if you go across the region you can see that there are some countries with nice solid ratings China for instance you know rated highly and you also have countries like Myanmar and you know basically where the Myanmar is not listed Mongolia you got Maldives you good so basically you can see the risk premiums vary across countries but they vary because they have different ratings I'd like to tell you this is the most downloaded data set on our website it gets used to the strangest places I have absolutely no control in how it gets used I've given up now I noticed when I know where I there's a time when I was noticing a lot of lit I can check how many people are coming to my website notice a lot of lithuanians coming in nothing Angel lithuanians but this is a small country I was 11 of my traffic from Lithuania and it turned out that the Lithuanian government had required people bidding for projects to use my country risk premiums to come up with this cartridge I remember getting a email from the the New Zealand milk board I didn't even know there was a milk board in New Zealand and I got this email saying we're using your country risk premiums you said milk prices for New Zealand Farmers what who you're selling the milk to Zimbabwe but usually the questions are how do you come up with these numbers and it's pretty mechanical it's basically what I described to you I started the US premium I described the process at this I get the rating get the spread and I multiply this multiplier but once in a while I get an email and I'm not sure how to respond to it I'll you know I'll give you one of my least favorite examples I get an email from Lebanon from somebody's obviously very pissed off at me you know it was a Lebanese business person whose business had been appraised for value for sale and the appraiser had used the risk premium for Lebanon from my website to come up with a discount rate you can see even you know lebanon's uses a 30.63 risk cream it was lower than but it's still a pretty high number you're gonna come up with a high discount rate doesn't matter what currency you do the valuation you're going to get at low value no and he said how come you gave Lebanon such a low Equity risk premium as if I'm sitting there saying I don't like this country I'll give it a high risk premium but and my you know initially my response was not my problem take it up with your appraiser but the email was from Lebanon and I said discretion was the better part of valor and I decided to blame somebody else I said it's not my fault you see whose fault it is why are some countries Equity risk premiums High not this low here what's a driving force behind the equatorial scribs it's your rating I said it's not my fault it's Moody's fault you want to take issue with them take it up with them here's their address all I'm trying to say is there's no intellectual Firepower Behind These numbers essentially I'm taking ratings driving them through and therein lies a weakness right I think I've systematically underestimated Equity risk premiums to the Middle East why you take Saudi Arabia there's very little default risk in Saudi Arabia nobody lies away because I will because they don't borrow money they have enough oil cash to keep going they don't have much in debt by focusing just on default risk I think I'm underestimating the risk in countries where there is potentially political risk or other risks which might affect my equities but might not affect buying bonds from the country and by focusing on ratings it also means that I you know I can't estimate Equity risk groups of countries that don't have ratings and until by 2015 those countries were not on my list I still remember it's 2016 I get an email from Assyrian business person must be the last guy running a business in Syria and he says look and I'm assessing hurdle rates for my business request reaction is assessing herded rates get your head out of the sand get out of the country now you know now and I'm looking on your website for an equity risk premium and I can't find it why and I told him look you know you're not rated you're not rated I can't assess a default spread and he wouldn't let go he said so what do you expect me to do how do I come up with hurdle rates and I said you have a point I'll try so starting in 2016 for these countries they're called Frontier markets and I'll list some of them it's countries like North Korea Syria of course if you're a business here I have a lot of business in North Korea I'm already a little wary about whether I should even be doing a discounted cash flow valuation in the first place but if you insist clearly you have a lot of risk here's how I've decided to fill in the Gap so they're up there and you can see the list it includes you know countries without a rating I was able to find a Score called political risk Services as a service in Europe that attaches a numerical score and it goes from low to high low are the countries which are riskiest don't ask me why they did it that way and hire the safest Switzerland was the safest country I think and the risk years might have been you know Syria I took those scores and then I looked for other countries with similar scores if you take for instance Syria I know that their political risk score I find three other countries which have similar scores and three and two of them are rated I took that rating and so it's cheating I'm basically taking other countries with similar risk scores that have a rating and a risk premium and attaching it to them but the bottom line is when I'm done I don't care where in the world you operate I can at least give you a judgment on this is what your Equity or scream should look like so that's how I get risk premiums for countries let's talk about going from there to yeah go ahead um right High PRS is good remember PR scores go from low to high see this is a problem with country risk scores is people can go from low to high Economist goes from high to low so the highest scores are the safest countries the lowest course of the riskiest so when you see low scores you're going to see high risk premiums go with that score when you see low scores you're going to see high-risk premiums go with it right so if you but you can get mismatches right where country risk score can be especially if you take the Middle East you can have a very low default risk but a High Country risk or people are worried about political risk or something else unfolding so now let's talk about going from countries to companies you're not valuing countries you're valuing companies and the question is how do we go from country risk premiums to to companies let's start with the lazy answer lazy answer is you tell me where you're Incorporated I'm going to give you the risk premium of wherever you trade so if you're an Indian company I give you the Indian risk brief it makes your life easy but I think it's incredibly sloppy and I already gave you the basis for that your risk doesn't come from where you're incorporating traded it comes from where you do business so I'm going to push you towards that and I'm going to leave open the possibility that sometimes you might use Revenue sometimes you might use production but my end game is to argue that your risk premium should reflect where you do business now of course the easiest way to measure how where you do business is rapidness and for 80 percent of companies of value I do use Revenue weights there are a couple of reasons I want you to think about what the reasons might be why revenues are often the weighting mechanism so here for instance I've taken embryo Brazilian Aerospace company weighted based on revenues I've taken and bab another Brazilian Emerging Market weighted by revenues why do you think I've picked Revenge one is Beggars can't be choosers to do this I need data right revenues are the one metric you will see companies systematically break down by geography so it's not because I wanted to I had no choice it didn't break down no some companies do break down things like ebitda or operating income but I'll tell you why I often pick revenues over those first revenues can never be negative and that's a good thing you see why if I use ebitda rabbit and one part of the world has losses how do I come up with a waiting mechanism do I give a negative weight to Latin America because you're losing money it doesn't quite work that way right so revenues are available they're always positive and that's where you should probably start see if you can see the revenue breakdown now one of the things you're going to run into and I'll tell you up front is you're going to be frustrated by how your company reports revenues because companies are incredibly I would say sloppy but strange about the way they break down rhodage if you're doing a European company most European companies break revenues down into into Europe maybe North America and e-m-e-a you know what the mea stands for basically they include Africa and the Middle East I mean they put it all into one basket they said what the heck are you guys doing what what do I do with this basket you will see and U.S companies have another problem if you look at the revenue breakdown to be revenues in the U.S revenues in the rest of the world come on guys the rest of the world is a really big place can you start to get more specific I know accounting pushes for all these changes I wish they pushed for changes on Revenue breakdowns that actually helped us in valuation but you got to live in the world you're in so whatever your company breaks down try to use it to come up with risk premiums but you're assuming that your risk exposure is driven by where you get your revenues the problem though is if you have a you know company like like Coca-Cola they can't break down by country why they're in 75 countries so they break down by region if you go back to pages and I and you look at the picture that I had for the word there you go if you look at the picture of the world at the bottom I've given you a regional Equity risk premium you know how I come up with that Regional Equity disagreement I take a weighted average of every country in the region why not a simple average because you take Asia I don't want to wait Vietnam and China equally obviously if you're if you tell me you're in Asia you're far more likely to get your revenues from China than Vietnam so what these are are weighted averages weights based on GDP so I'll send you the spreadsheet the spreadsheet with my country risk creams it's actually it's not rocket science I pull up the GDP I take away to the average and the reason I do those weighted averages is precisely because of companies like Coca-Cola which give me Regional averages I can use the regional Equity risk cream to come up with an equity risk premium for the company but still Revenue based but I told you the one exception where I don't use Revenue if you have a company that's a natural resource company an oil company a mining company I think you have no choice but to look at where they get the natural resources where the extractor and all companies are actually pretty good they will tell you where they're they're you know is an example of this you know you take Royal Dutch this is my 2015 or 16 I value the company they told you where they get their oil and gas and I took a weighted average based on where they get their oil so in pure consumer product companies like Coca-Cola Revenue rates work fine in natural resource companies production or you know where you get the oil weights but there are some companies we might decide to include both and you have to decide hey which matters more and it's a judgment call you got to make so when you look at your company start with the revenue breakdown then ask yourself is this the kind of company where I have to look at where their production comes from companies are very opaque about that but if you know that then you might want to bring that into the picture as well the objective is you want to make sure that your risk premium reflects your operating risk exposure for the company so I want to make sure that everybody's okay with that intuitive rationale that a risk for a company doesn't come from where it's Incorporated and traded but from where it does business and then we can debate how do we measure that exposure should we use Revenue should we use operating income should we use habitat should we I mean I'm open to suggestions but I think that is a healthy debate it's a debate we should be having about how do we capture operating risk risk exposure go ahead yeah you have to decide 60 40 50. this the one rule is the weights have to add up to 100 so if you decide to go half on revenues half on production you can do that but you got to make that judgment call depending on how easy is it to move your manufacturing with with oil and gas obviously it's impossible so somewhere between the very easy to The Impossible you've got to put your company on that scale because that's what's going to determine the relative weights now now I've kind of conceded this as I've gone along now you can use revenues but there is a danger of using revenues right which is your exposure might come from your factories being in a country and if your country shuts down you won't be able to use it now and the question also that you have to face is what do I do with this Equity risk premium for my company should I assume it's a constant so if you tell me you're in countries it's three percentage or should I scale it up if you're in a risky business in other words you get a double Wham if you're a risky business in a risky country do you see why if you are selling a discretionary product in a very risky country You could argue that you're exposed not just to Country risk but you're Overexposed so I'm going to show you three ways in which country risk premiums get played out and you're going to see very different numbers come out but they're not coming out from the equations they're coming out from different assumptions we're making about how country risk plays our new cost of equity and finally if you think about country risk in specific there's some companies which have exposure to single country and you worry just about the country you don't care about the rest of the word you say I want to focus in on this country and I want to get a more refined measure of country risk where I look past revenues I look past earnings I look at everything the companies do and I'll give you the the roots of this approach it was about 20 years ago I was flying to Brazil to do a valuation seminar and at that time I was doing what other people did which is treat all Brazilian companies as equally exposed to Brazilian countries and two companies in my in my that I was using as lab experiments one was in Breyer the Brazilian Aerospace company and if you're not familiar with it the next time you're on a short haul flight in the U.S take a look at the aircraft probably an embryo aircraft that you're flying on and the other was you know company with the more localized it was basically um I I think it was embev at that time almost entirely a Brazilian company and I was using the same Equity risk premium for both countries and I said you know what for both companies and I said that doesn't make sense embryo gets 97 percent of its revenues outside Brazil and even though its factories are in Brazil it should be less exposed to Brazilian country risk then embed which gets almost all of its revenues in Brazil so I decided to concoct a measure notice the word I use can call derived means the thought went into it but I'm gonna play 30 000 feet up in the air I'm exhausted I can to the measure a measure that would measure a company's exposure to Country risk I decided to give the measure a name I called it Lambda why because I've decided attaching a Greek alphabet to things gives it this layer of sophistication that makes it less likely that people will prescribe I'm going to come up the Lambda it's going to look a lot like a beta so if you're as exposed as the typical company in the country I'm going to give you a Lambda of one if you're more exposed to Lambda will be higher than one and then you're less exposed your Lambda will be less than one then I went to sleep landed in Brazil did the presentation threw this idea out then one of the more pragmatic people in the audience says well how exactly are you going to measure Lambda I said I haven't thought about that yet but I have a long flight back and on that long flight back I actually wrote a paper that's still on my website on estimating what are the things you would look at to estimate Lambda so you start with things aware your revenues where's your production what risk management products do you use but also things like are you a company that the government views as being in the National interest if you are your Lambda just went up right because the minute you get tagged as a company in the National interest there is going to be a government effect you know you're going to be more exposed to that country so essentially I said if I had all this information I wanted to get a more refined estimate how would I do it and I came up with multiple ways of doing it but one of the things that I said was hey you could start with revenge and come up with a Lambda it's a very simplistic approach and I'll give you a very the way it would play out let's suppose you took two Indian companies starter modus and data Consulting Services they're both part of the same family group but Tata Motors in 2008 and got about 91 of its revenues from India and Tata consulting services got about eight percent of its revenues in India they both thought of companies they're both Indian companies the typical Indian company got about 80 of its revenues in India 2009. so here's a simplistic estimate of Lambda for Tata Motors I'm going to take the 91 and divide by 80 I come up with the lab down 1.14 it's more exposed than the typical Indian company because at least in 2008 nine it was getting more of its revenues permitted in a typical Indian company you know that number changed it next year right what did automotives do in 2009 they changed their exposure to India they bought Jaguar Land Rover the minute they did that their revenue portion in India dropped to 70 percent the Lambda decreased but that's what you'd expect right you bought a large global company you've made yourself less exposed to Indian Country risk in contrast with TCS you divide eight percent by 80 you get a Lambda of 0.09 you take that country risk premium for India you multiply by 0.09 instead of 1.14 you can see the cost of equity I get for a company with a low Lambda will be much lower than the cost of equity that I get for another company in the same Market with a higher Lambda I use this only as an exception for most companies I do what I showed you with Coca-Cola I take a weighted average I wash my hands off I move on I beg a fish to fry but if you gave me a company with a single country where you know where exposure to that country you want to get a much clearer sense of what that exposure is then maybe a Lambda approach is worth exploring but it's going to take more work more data to get there because you're trying to make it richer but you're still basing this on revenues right it's simplistic here's another way in which you can think about Landis what is Lambda measure it measures how much your company is affected by changes in country risk right if you have a low Lambda I'm arguing you're less exposed to changes in country risk than if you have a high laptop does anybody remember how we get a beta for a company what do we do we run a regression of what against what we take Returns on a stock and run it against Returns on a market index beta measures how my company moves as the equity index moves right let's suppose I took Returns on your stock and ran a regression against Returns on a country Bond do you see what I'm capturing what a country Bond return switch because country risk goes up and down country bonds go reflect that right so if you have a company that's very exposed to Country risk you should expect its returns to be very sensitive to what's happening in the country Bond so I learned a regression and you know it's this was a mess to do I would you know that's why I do it very infrequently I took this is the case of two Brazilian companies one in Briar and the other in Brattle which is the phone company which got all its revenues in Brazil I ran a regression against a bond called the c bond the c bond was a Brazilian dollar denominated Bond so what causes c bond returns to shift is Brazil's country risk is going up and down I ran a regression and here's what I got the output for every one percent change in the c bond embryos returns moved by only 0.27 it was relatively less exposed so its country just went up and down why because it got 93 of its revenues outside Brazil the fact that Brazil was getting riskier safer people didn't care as much in contrast with their battle every one percent change in the c bond translated into a two percent change in returns let's make this now you know take the adani valuation this is the company for better awards that is so closely died to Indian Country risk it's a very different company than valuing you know a Reliance petrochemicals right this is a company who your views on what will happen the company are almost completely linked up to your views on how India will grow in the infrastructure investment I'm not going to try to estimate a Lambda but if you think about the Lambda for nadani you're clearly not just exposure you can't risk you're exposed far more than the typical Indian company I'm not saying it's a good thing or a bad thing but that's what we're trying to estimate with Lambda is how exposed is my company the country risk and is there a way to calculate it so I've thrown a lot of different ways of thinking about this let me try to bring them all into one page and I will leave you thinking about this page okay 2004 let's suppose I want to estimate a cost of equity for a brow I'll give you five different ways I can estimate the cost of equity and they're going to give me very different numbers but two of the numbers are going to deviate from the other three and I want you to think about what I'm assuming in the two of two different approaches or the two sub two sets of approaches that give me different numbers in the first one I use what Bankers do treat embryo is a Brazilian company give it the country risk premium for Brazil and at that time the country risk premium for Brazil was 7.89 huge because this is right after Lula was elected for the first time in Brazil people worried about what the future would bring risk premiums are shot up so I got 17 and this is all in US dollar term so I'm not even doing it in three items 17.24 if I take the second approach I took the same 7.89 but use the revenue weights to come up with my script and because it gets only three percent of its revenues in Brazil I get a much lower cost of equity in fact the three approaches give me nine to eleven percent cost of equity are all approaches where I look at where embryo gets its revix but it's a Lambda approach or the weighted Revenue approach the two approaches where I get much higher numbers our approach is where I treat it as a Brazilian company so the big decision I have to make here is should I look at embroidery as a Brazilian company or should I look at where its risk is coming from because that's going to make and within that whether you multiply by Beta not multiply by Beta the effects are much smaller will my valuation be very different if I use a 9 to 11 cost of equity instead of a 17 that's 18 absolutely that's a consequential choice and I think I've given you my biases which is I think the 9 to 11 is a much more realistic cost of equity for a broader than the 17 or 18 you get and this is going to be true for a lot of Emerging Market companies which have significant exposure outside that emerging market but the rest of the work treats them as Brazilian companies and Indian companies they're going to be given this High Cost of equity in a low value right so here's my final question let's assume that you believe that risk comes from where you do business not from where you're Incorporated that's what you think should be praised in let's assume markets disagree with you their pricing things in based on where a company is located I have a question about what kinds of companies are going to be undervalued by the market if it makes that mistake you see where I'm going with this in the case if you take in it's going in forces the TCS in the world that are going to be undervalued the case of Brazil it's going to be embryo that's going to be undervaded let's say you go buy that undervalued company because you think Mark is doing your own thing what do we make investments because we want to make money right so what has to happen money the market has to come to its senses right I think when will that be I don't know but you know what would trigger it coming to its census is a crisis where the rest of these meltdown but Empire is able to report earnings no matter what it's it's the reality that stares you in the face but you have no idea when that reality check will come I think the way which Emerging Market companies are valued and priced often reflects a very misplaced sense of risk coming from where and corporate and trade the flip side of that there's a lot of U.S companies that are really Emerging Market companies Coca-Cola has 60 of its revenues for emerging markets we need to be treating these companies as riskier than they are so this is not just about Emerging Market companies it's a point I'm making about multinationals in general so let's stop with that when we come back on Wednesday we will continue with this 
come on I had a question about like valuing a biotech or Healthcare should I ask you close to us thank you thank you okay folks I thought I'd start today's class by pulling up about I think 93 of you have entered your Tesla number some of the valuation of the week that I sent out I was like I was hoping for like 350 but that might have been hoping for too many but but 93 of you turned it in so I thought it'd be nice to pull up the crowd valuation to see what you found this is what the distribution looks like it's got Peaks at 120 to 140 which must be pure coincidence that my starting number was what 130. just a thought experiment if my starting valuation had been 180 do you think the entire distribution might have turned that's what it is right stock prices are 200. if you did the evaluation today could it be higher absolutely the stock price I mean the notion that you can somehow be objective I wanted to set it aside please be honest with yourself things affect you and that can you know that can show up in the evaluation so that was just you know I just wanted to show you that and um you know if you get a chance try it with the adani group you're saying I don't know Indian company I don't either okay but I know infrastructure companies and infrastructure companies are big Capital intensive companies with low margins you say I don't have never valued a family group company well no so what still cash flows growth and risk so give it your best shot see what you get and next week I'll show you the distribution for that and we'll see how that plays out so let's shut let me shut this down and go to the start of the class test for today today we're going to talk about something called an implied equilateral spring remember last class we talked about historical risk premiums and I Look Backwards and then I really dug a grave and buried it I said it's backward looking it's noisy and that survival bias right see why we're still using it I don't but that's the way most people still get historic risk Greenwich today I'm going to give you an alternative it's going to look complex but I'm going to simplify it in the start of the class test so you're going to be my guinea pig today right don't worry this is not a complicated so don't worry don't overthink it right so let's assume that you're looking at an investment where you have a guaranteed cash flow of one dollar every year forever and that give you that investment how much would you pay for that investment today you're going to get one dollar every year in perpetuity right you get it back in one year but then everything else is pure icing on the cake right if you told me one dollar I probably wouldn't sell you the investment right in fact I'll probably give you the trigger at which I'd sell it to you so you want to stick with the dollar you want to try another number five dollars if you take five dollars what are you requiring as a rate of return you're going to get one dollar every year remember the principal doesn't come back you paid five dollars you're moving to make twenty percent so you're telling me you want a risk-free investment of 20 with that will deliver 20 percent okay that's in fact I'm not saying don't retake it but that's what your price tells me right what did you how much 25. yeah you see the basically that's going to be my trigger right so if you offered me 25 I'm probably going to say that's close to so the risk-free rate I can get by what you pay for risk free investment let's make this trickier so you know the risk reinvestment is there I can tell what a reasonable return is if it's four percent twenty five dollars let's suppose I came to you with the same kind of bed but now I'm going to give you a dollar but it's going to come from an average risk business this isn't expected cash so if this says the average risk equity you're going to get a one dollar each year forever so let me stay with you offer 25 for that risk-free will you offer less or more for the second bet so give me a number ten dollars he said ten dollars if you offer ten dollars what you expect to return on equities ten percent so what's the equity risk premium that I get out of that four percent was the risk free rate you wanted ten percent you're telling me your Equity risk premium is six percent right do you see what I'm going to go with this right you ask people what do you like to make they're gonna say I like to make eight percent nine percent but what you pay is the best indicator or what do you expected return is so if you pay a lot for a risky investment don't tell me that you want a high Equity risk premium you've priced the investment to earn a low Equity risk cream an implied Equity respond that's all I'm going to do is I want to look at what you pay not what you say I'm going to use the level of stock prices to back out the expected Equity risk premium so it's not rocket science it's just the mechanics of I don't trust people when they tell me this is what I'd like to make but I can see what they pay and I'm going to back out of that what their creditors premium should be so let's build on this right so you wanted a 10 risk premium I'm sorry six percent or roughly six percent equity risk Maybe studies consistently show that risk aversion is not something you get to pick it's what you're born with and it depends on how old you are whether you have a family so you know the degree of risk aversion varies even across this room I tell people I have four kids I could have told you when they were four years old whether they want to be option Traders or whole bonds my oldest until he was 15 still came down the stairs you know holding on to the banister fixed income guy if you ever saw one right I might fall now I might fall now but right now my youngest when he was two years old took off from the top step expecting to be caught before he hit the bottom there's an option Trader risk aversion some of it you're just born with some of us are more risk-averse than others so match.com probably should have a risk-averse engine section right now what's your risk aversion coefficient but risk aversion does also change over time studies consistently show that as people age they get more riskers for lots of different reasons so now I'm going to connect it to equity risk premiums you take markets like Japan parts of Europe they're aging right even China is because you know you reached a point where because of an intermediate period of one child policies you've now reached the population is going to age it's neither good nor bad but if you just take aging into effect what's going to happen to equity risk premiums in these markets they're going to the restrooms are going to go up right because as you get older you get Boris couples and the Market's getting older you're going to see the so you can see that risk aversion can change because of demographics it's a risk aversion can be different because you're born with different risk aversion can change because of demographics let's complete the process let's suppose while you're sitting here today don't freak out nothing bad's happened but let's say that you get this big crisis it could be covet hitting remember it happened over a couple of weeks it could be you know some news of a that makes you think there's a recession coming 9 11. do you think your risk conversion might be affected that were you willing to pay ten dollars for that dollar maybe would that change if you got it it sure it makes complete it's common sense to say I demand I was willing to pay ten dollars before this crisis but now you know what I'm gonna pay only eight dollars so let's see what you know where we are Equity risk creams can vary across people it can vary because because of demographics and it can vary across time I'm making an argument that whatever approach we use to estimate Equity risk premiums needs to be dynamic it needs to be dynamic because you can't have a number that stays the same as we're going through prices and good times and in bad times it doesn't work that way historical risk premiums of zero chance of doing that right why because you have 99 years of History dragging you towards the same number you can be the worst crisis of all time but you're looking backwards and everything's okay so I'm going to make Arguments for implied Aquarius problems and I'm going to tell you why I haven't used a historical Equity risk premium in 25 years to value a company I've laid the foundations for it but I need to replace it with something else and I'm going to give you my approach to estimating applied Equity response I don't expect a hundred percent buy-in but I want you to think about why I'm doing it and if you don't like it what your middle ground is going to be because you can pick a different approach but it's got to be dynamic it's got to be forward-looking and you got to come up with numbers that reflect the times you're in so let's turn back to I think page 64. was where we were in the notes okay and let's talk about implied Equity risk prediction so the basic idea is what what I just showed you if I've expected cash flows what you pay for something should give me a sense of what you expect to make picked as a market where this is how we get expected returns it's a bond market somebody remind me again what the yield to maturity on a bond is how do you compute the yield to maturity in a bonding you want to try how do you get the yield to maturity in a bond that's who you're jumping ahead before even getting there what do I start with I started the price you paid for the bond then I get the coupons every year and then I look at the face value and the year to maturity actually doesn't take into account reinvestment it just says what discount rate makes the present value of my coupons and face value implicit there are assumptions about reinvestment but the yield to maturity is like an irr right it's an irr for a bond price of the bond coupons and cash flow it's a forward-looking number is it Dynamic God was it Dynamic last year you know remember how much the interest rate changed because the price of the bond was changing I'm going to take what we do in the bond market and try to do it with stocks let's do the easy part can I get the price you're paying for stock here at the S P 500 index but rather than coupons what you hope and pray you will get when you buy stocks maybe dividends the U.S increasingly BuyBacks and unlike a coupon which is a fixed number I don't know what this will be I can tell you what it was in the last 12 months leading in I might even be able to get estimates of what people are expecting earnings and cash flows to grow so it's a little messier than a bond but still the same problem right you got the price you got the cash flows and just as I compute a discount rate that makes the present value of the bond cash flow is equal to the price of the bond I can compute a discount rate that makes the present value of cash flows on equities equal to what you paid up front so this isn't rocket science it's just taking something from the bond market and applying it to stocks so let me take you back to the start of 2020. if print world we lived in right nobody wore a mask maybe in Asia if they wore from SARS or whatever else but no it was pure Mass probably people thought you're probably trying to rip them off and they called the police on you free coffee this was the implied Equity risk premium at the start of 2020. so here's how I got it I got the level of the index 3 000 to 30.78 so you instead of buying a bond you bought the 500 largest market cap stocks in the US I know what you paid for it I told you I can't tell you what the cash flows will be in the future but I can tell you what the dividends and BuyBacks were in the 12 months leading into the start of 2020 and dividends in BuyBacks were 150.50 none of this is difficult to get they're all public information you can go to the s p website look up dividends look up BuyBacks so I know what you paid I know what the cash flows were last year let me bring in one final piece of the puzzle the S P 500 is the most tracked and followed index in the world there are at least a dozen analysts who track just the index they don't even do individual companies they track the index of forecast earnings are they always right now nobody's ever always right but that's their focus and at the start of 2020 they were expecting a growth rate of about four percent a year in earnings and cash flows do you see where I'm going to go next right I take the 150.5 I grow it at four percent a year to get expected cash flows why do I stop after five years because I'm getting increasingly uncomfortable these are the 500 largest market cap companies in the US they can't keep growing faster than the economy for the long term because where's the growth going to come from so the end of the fifth year I put these companies collectively into stable growth remember we talked about that as a closure what's the stable growth is growth rate at which the economy can grow at over time and I use the risk-free rate as my proxy for the growth rate you're going to see me do this repeatedly because I'm going to say that's the best estimate that was 1.92 percent so think of this as a present value problem I know what you paid there are my cash flows beyond the fifth year this is the present value of all cash flows Beyond air five that's the terminal value equation just written as an equation I solve for r how the hell am I going to solve that mathematically it's really messy right thank God for the solver function in Excel or the gold seek function all you do in that function is you set the value equal to the level of the index and solve for R in two seconds later Excel comes back and says 7.12 you're saying what does that even mean if you bought stocks at the start of 2020 I don't care what you hoped you would make what you prayed you would make what you thought you would make given what you paid for stocks you can expect to make 7.12 here the risk free rate demand rate was 1.92 the difference is an implied Equity risk premium you see why I call it implied I'm backing it out from what you paid you don't like it you paid for it you think it's too low then stop buying stocks I am not forcing you to do it there's no model behind it it's completely model agnostic right it just says this is what you pay these are your cash flows this is what you expected return should be do you think that number would be different on January 2nd of 2020 and January 3rd what of all the inputs that I've used which is going to be the one that's most volatile every day when you open up the paper and you look at movements the previous day of all of the numbers earnings cash flows s p 500. giving away the answer there it's going to be every time the index moves you expected return is changing right in fact it's because your expected return is changing that you're moving the index you know why I picked the start of 2020. because six weeks later Kobe hit February 14th I think was the official day when the Italians announced because until then we thought it was on China and cruise ships and will never come abroad here it's amazing how much in denial you are and February 14th we heard that there are a couple of hundred Italians who've never been to China on a cruise ship and they had coveted it's almost like people come oh my God it's here and here's what happened to the implied Equity risk premium see this is where we are up till February so it's almost till February 20th the 21st you could say oh nothing's happening nothing's happening nothing's happening oh my God something's happening and you can see the risk premium shoot through the roof this is the U.S the S P 500 supposedly a developed Market this is not supposed to happen right in the course of six weeks the equity risk premium went from about four percent or 400 4.7 4.5 or 4.6 percent almost to 8 percent are you surprised I mean you guys lived through those six weeks but you imagine we had no idea what was coming the economy was shutting down this could have been a depression it could wipe out half the population nobody knew what was coming of course risk premiums are going to reflect that March 23rd of 2020 was the absolute bottom for that crisis I actually say newspaper articles from that day because the basics of the end this year I got more calls from people I hadn't heard from in the previous two weeks said what do I do now sell everything move into a cave I said do whatever you want maybe take all your money put in a brown paper bag send it to me and then go live in a cave right I'll use some money somewhere but people were completely and totally panicked one of the things I did during the covet crisis is every week I wrote a post about what I was feeling that not that people cared about my feeling but I wanted to record in real time but because after the crisis passed it's amazing how with the benefit of hindsight I knew everything was going to be okay really I didn't and some I mean if you want to see what happened in March 23rd something broke this the crisis and it was one of the most amazing returns back to normalcy I've ever seen because by September the equities back to where it was at the start of the year I mean this isn't the only time it's happened you know you go back to 2008 I you know every time we're in a crisis I start to do the implied Equity risk premium by day I do it because it's cathartic for me because otherwise you're listening to people tell you to freak out I stopped watching CNBC I stopped reading the news because nothing good is going to come out of that right but I completely implied premium every day because it keeps me sane it forces me to think about what's happening how much are people demanding for us does this make sense and there are periods where Equity restrooms can change dramatically on a date forget about month to month on an hour to hour basis the equilateral swim can change and if you value companies you need to keep tabs on what that Equity risk premium looks like right now because you're valuing a company on February 12th of 2020. it doesn't matter what the equity risk screens will look like in the future you value the company the market you're in and you got to build in the premium that reflects somebody back there had a question go ahead okay then bring up all the same problems not at all right those are your actual cash flows if you feel that they're too high what do you do you put no negative growth rate right you control the expected cash flows this is not a the only reason we use expected cash flows is sticky you know what I mean by sticky dividends move remarkably little from year to year the BuyBacks do go up and down but cash flows are the least volatile number in this entire analysis it's the S P 500 and no crisis that I know of has ever been triggered by cash flows changing overnight it's always been triggered by Equity risk premiums changing overnight people getting worried about the future so you're right I'm estimating cash flows and I could be wrong right and it'll show up as what a standard error around my implied Equity risk group so I compute that in fact if you go to my and I'll send you the spreadsheet after today's email of my February 2023 update because I update this startup every month and if you look at the range I get with my implied premium because I allow for the fact that the cash flows could be too high I replaced with a 10-year average I look at normalized numbers my implied Equity risk premiums range from four and a half percent so I think 6.3 percent do you think that's a big range remember what the range was when I used historical risk premiums one to nine I'm not saying this is precise but I'm saying that it's less imprecise than anything else you've got to face no matter which approach you you're gonna have to make estimates and here I'm willing to live with that that range it's it's a narrower range because there are fewer things I can go wrong on any other questions yes like the vix it's a contemporaneous variable right in other words you either so let's say I gave you the vix which you can so you can measure it on a daily basis how do you convert that into a percentage premium I need to have to figure a triggering mechanism but the vix reflects exactly the same fears as what's driving your Equity risk and the equity experiments is more directly an answer to your question uh yeah and also the vix doesn't measure what you're actually paying for stocks it's kind of an indirect measure where the vix can do sometimes strange things as stocks are moving this is a much more direct measure it's very closely connected intrinsic value it says tell me what you paid tell me what you get I'll tell you what to make as an expected return so I said I do this at the I used to do this at the start of every year and when people ask why aren't you updating my reaction was how much can it change in a year and then came 2008. and I learned how much it can change in a year so starting in September of 2008 I've been reporting this number on a monthly basis on my website it's the very front page I said this is what it's the start of the month and you'd see you can get the monthly Erp going back every month of September 2008. you know how I use that premium start of February 2023 that premium is 5.41 every company I choose to value in February I'm going to value with that that as my premium why because I've got to live in the market I'm in I'm valuing a company given where the market is today what will I use next month I have no idea I'll have to redo it in March it basically means that my valuations will constantly update to reflect what the market is demanding as a price for risk at that point in time will it make your intensive valuations more volatile yes but it'll make it more realistic yes table is not realistic in a world where everything is Shifting around you so let me bring you up to January 2023 started this year the index was at 38 39.50 you can drop the second last two decimals if you want the cash flow is coming in 181.99 so in the last three years cash flows have gone from 150.5 to 181.99 analysts are projecting a bad 2023 or at least a subdued 2023 but a bounce back in 2024. you think parent analysts going to be wrong it could be but remember what I'm trying to estimate given what people are expecting on cash flows what is internal rate of return so even if they're being unrealistic about those expectations I need to build them in and doing exactly what I did in 2020 the return I got as my expected return was 9.82 do you remember what it was at the start of 2020 I'll take you back to that page I think it was 7.12 percent 9.82 percent you know what it was at the start of 2022 5.75 the biggest one-year change in expected return on stocks that I've tracked I'm I'm I've tracked this from 1960 to 2022. it's the biggest one-year change in expected return because you got a double whammy last year t-bond rates went up and Equity risk premiums went up as well in 2008 Equity response went up but because it was a crisis t-bond rates went down you all you almost always get that offset in 2022 both numbers pushed up but in 20 at the start of 2022 the equity risk premium was 5.94 that number is dropped at the start of February to 5.41 why notice the mood is somehow lightened in markets you watch CNBC people are smiling they're laughing it won't last that long enjoy it yeah but clearly the last six weeks people seem to have got this new window we've got this thing under control yep every week usually but they don't do it very there I'll tell you what the biggest the weakness with the analysts forecast it's sticky it seems to take a while for them it's not that they don't update it often enough but their updates are not as big as they should be in periods you know so that earnings number has gone down about six percent over the last year as stock has gone from there's no recession to recession it's almost like the island is saying the motor session so there is that stickiness in earnings and here's what it'll mean if analysts are overestimating the growth rate what will it do to My Equity risk premium to make My Equity risk be higher that's the standard error issue right so if you took lower estimates of growth you'll come up with 5.6 percent as your Equity risk and I accept that there is going to be that noise in the estimate especially in periods where earnings judgments are changing to give you a sense of where this number Falls in a historical context here's what I'm going to do I'm going to go back and show you what the implied Equity risk premium has been through history I would argue that every statement you hear about stocks is really a statement about Equity response you know what I mean by that right stocks are overvalued stocks are undervalued I can restate it as a statement about Equity risk premiums so when you tell me stocks are overvalued what are you telling me about Equity risk premiums that they're too low or too high too low and you want them to be higher so basically you're saying hey Equity response become too low when you tell me stocks are undervalued you're making a statement so when I show you the equity risk from the start of 2023 this is all this talk about is there a you know is there pain coming will stocks drop this is not going to give you a conclusive answer to this but the question we're asking is it's 5.94 a loan number is it a high number where are we so to give you that perspective here's what I did I I'm sorry I went back and got the equilateral scripts every year from 1960 through 2022 and it tells you the story of U.S equities for the last six years here the 1960s incredibly stable period for Equity risk groups three to three and a half percent the U.S was the center of the global economic universe and the premiums reflect that stability 1970 something is going on right what's happening in the ecuadoris premium it's shooting through the roof and what was the trigger what do you say Oil Embargo women that was that but remember the oil and bar go by itself was what started the ball rolling but what did it create in the following years inflation that was the first decade in a long time that Americans actually saw double-digit inflation why does higher inflation push up Equity risk premiums but that's a level right risk is about uncertainty so you got any time you asked about risk it's got to be a story about a higher number must go with more volatility right and I think that's the problem it's not the high inflation per se but when you have high inflation whether you like it or not it comes with more uncertainty about inflation I tell people who you know I give them a choice of two economies one has five percent inflation the other is three percent inflation and so which one would you prefer to invest and do business in Muslims I'll take the three percent and say let me add to this fight let's suppose in the first economy not only is inflation five percent it'll be guaranteed to be five percent every year forever and the second economy inflation is three percent but to be one of five I'll take the first economy over the second one because inflation then becomes a constant you know exactly how much of a wage increase you should demand how much to raise prices but High inflation goes with uncertainty about inflation and through Market history higher inflation has gone with more risk premiums higher risk premiums now do you see why 2022 was unusual right inflation went up that pushed up interest rates but because of his inflation triggered not covert triggered or banking crisis triggered Equity risk premiums also went up 1978 the Aquarius crime in the U.S hit six and a half percent you know what the Dow is trading at 1978. 800 there were three numbers in the Dow imagine that three numbers what is it at now 20 something thousand fact Business Week ran a headline stocks are dead which to be should be a sign that anytime Business magazines put a headline like that it's time to buy because if you bought stocks in 1978 you wrote one of the great bull markets of all time because as markets Rose guess what happened to equity risk creams so through the seven the late 70s the 80s into the 90s and then it keeps going and kept going down and in fact at the end of 1999 Equity risk premiums in the U.S hit two percent forget about the abstraction if I said if you invest in stocks you make two percent more than the t-bond rate and I said would that be enough for you most of us are not no that's not enough that's a lot of risk I'm taking two percent sounds too low but guess what people in 99 were saying that's okay now the stories were there will never be a recession again we've discovered the secret to Everlasting growth .com at the end the moment didn't last that long because in the years in the two years after you had the.com bus imply Equity bounced back to four percent they settled in for a period between four to five percent nice stable period again this is the thing about markets they lull you into a sense of false complacency before hitting you around the face the 2008 he asked me you know we've been around four percent I might even have said that it's all on a recording somewhere probably or you use a four percent premium doesn't change that much over time and markets are waiting just for that moment and say really let me show you and that's 2008. take a look at what happened premium shoots up that is what crises do they make pre and that crisis not only made premiums go up they stayed high for about four years in fact since 2008 Equity risk premiums have been both higher and more volatile than they were pre-2008 and I don't think that's going to change you know why welcome to globalization what does globalization do it links us all at the hip in 1988 if there was a crisis in Sao Paulo you know what happened to U.S stocks so where's Sao Paulo somewhere I don't know is Latin America doesn't bother us China that's you know Asia somewhere who cares today if there's a crisis anywhere it's a crisis everywhere right what does that do it connects equities that they have their benefits to globalization but one of the downsides is around the world Equity risk premiums have become higher in Mobile so if you look at that graph and you say it's 5.94 that's where we are at the start of where does it fall well it looks pretty good right for stocks because you're earning a higher premium this is not 19.99. so if you're one of these you know Perpetual you know the sky is falling the world is ending you know sell everything people they've been saying that for 10 years now they might have a good reason Michael Barry might have a good reason for saying sell everything but I don't see it backed up in the ecuaders premium so it's in fact first week of 2023 somebody asked me what do you think about stocks I've had a terrible year I said you know they've had a terrible year that's that's true I mean who can contest it's a fact but given what Equity risk premiums are right now I feel okay it doesn't mean there will not be a recession won't affect my earnings and cash flows but it's become the one number that I watch on a monthly basis it you know because the alternative to things like PE ratios right you can watch them but they're all over the place they don't factor in that interest rates are changing this is like a composite number that brings in what happens to interest rates through the analysis it make brings in what's happening the economy through the growth rate and then comes up with the composite number say are you okay with this at the start of last year good that's about the economy right less about the market and more about the economy right that's an earnings growth story because right now one of the if you're bearish about markets remember I've used that six percent growth of the drop in 2023 bucks but that's a soft Landing for earnings so even if there's a recession we're assuming it's going to be a one-year effect it's not going to leave lasting damage but let's say you believe that this is a mother of all recessions coming you know it's going to change right your growth rate is not going to be plus six percent going forward it might be minus 25 2009. was a mother of all recessions effect or not that takes a long time to climb out of so one way to bring in discussions or questions about the real economy is through the cash flows build it in then ask yourself what kind of return will I make if I building those cash flows it's not going to be 5.94 percent but if it's 4.94 you're still okay right but if it's 2.94 percent you say maybe I should be selling stock so whatever the story is bring it in through on the conduits you have it's got to be cash flows it's got to be growth and then work out what the implied Equity risk premium is with that because otherwise it becomes a one hand on the other hand right I'm going to say something about Market strategies and forecasts that I find at least they irritate me there you know I'd rather be transparently wrong than opaquely right you know what they will pay clear right you listen to this guy on CNBC said the stock could be at 100 you know but it could be 30 you know but it could be 50 you know if this happens it could be 120 and then at the end he said what did he ask me to do they asked me to buy the stock or sell the stock that's being opaquely right because you're going to be right no matter what happens because somewhere in the conversation you threw in a number here if I'm wrong you can go back and say you got the cash flow wrong the advantage of implied Equity risk premiums is you can't do the one hand on the other hand and dance away from the problem you're forced to think about what am I most worried about where will it show up so if inflation is your concerned think about where it shows up in those numbers your inflation continues to go up what's going to happen the bond rates are going to continue to rise your Equity risk premium will get higher because you need higher risk premiums every concern becomes a question you can ask about implied Equity description the start of last year the implied Equity discrete was 4.24 by itself that's not a troubling number right 2.24 percent you know it's a little it's a little lower than what you have earned in the last 20 years but it's a little higher actually than the 60-year average you know what was Troublesome though about last year's number it was on top of a t-bond rate which is 1.51 percent 1.51 plus 4.24 gives me an expected return of 5.75 so if you think about the total expected return you were making at the start of last year you know the only justification was what choice do I have risk free rates are too low and in a sense 2020 to pointed out that there's a danger when you invest based on what choice do I have because risk-free rates adjusted Equity screams went up so there's advantage to tracking both the equity risk premium and the total expected return on both dimensions the start of 2023 looks a lot better than the start of 2022. even though people felt better at the start of 2022 right because they were coming off a bullish year so sometimes how people feel is actually a contrarian indicator of how they should be feeling because you come off a good time you pushed up prices you push down risk premiums you're actually the more dangerous place than when you come off a year when you push down stock prices and pushed up expected returns and Equity risk premiums so the equity risk premium is the price of risk in the equity Market you can see it changing over time is there an analogous price in the bond market it's called a default spread on a bond you know what I have with this graph the red line is the equity risk premium the black line is the default spread on a b double a rated Bond a b double a rated bond is an investment grade Bond it's actually one of the save for one so basically it's not triple aerated but b double a rated notice the b double a rate it's spread so that's the spread over the T bond rate so it's a it's a price of risk in the bond market that number also goes up and down what causes to go up and down in Good Times you stop worrying about default risky charge lower spreads and bad times you start more and most of the time the two move together right price of risk goes up in the equity Market default spreads go up 2022 Equity restraints went up default spreads also went up why because people were scared about inflation but there are times when the two markets have diverged in the last 25 years and when that happens something strange is going on right why are people getting more worried in equity markets and less worried in bond markets I'll take you back to two of those types the first occurred after 9 11. and Alan Greenspan said I will not let the U.S economy go into recession the hubris of central Bankers I will not let the U.S economy go into recession and he actually tried to engineer a scenario where the U.S economy wouldn't go into recession the way he did it was he essentially pumped up the bond market and default spreads if you look at what happened after 2021 the fault spreads dropped between 2002 to 2000 so people are charging less and less risk in the bond market while charging actually higher prices for risk in the equity Market it's not just the bond market people are lending money and charging too low on interest rate that's basically what it is right you know people give lots of reasons for the 2008 crisis bad Banks and I'm sure you can name a lot of culprits to me the core problem that led to 2008 is not that people are lending money to to individuals with bad credit it's a good business to lend for people with bad credit if you do what if you charge a high enough interest rate right they were lending money to people with bad credit and not charging an interest rate to cover that risk and that never ends well to the 2008 crisis I think was the first crisis in the last century where the bond market is really more responsible than the stock market people pushing down spreads too much in contrast go to the late 90s late 90s default spreads are staying pretty stable but Equity risk premiums are plummeting you're in this.com boom people are pushing up stock prices the equator scream is going from five percent to four percent to three percent to two percent in fact in 1999 the default spread on a b double a rate bond the investment grade Bond was two percent you are getting a fairly safe Bond and making a two percent spread and the equity risk screen for investing in equities collectively was two percent if you had the benefit of being objective as an investor very difficult to step back from The Fray in 1999 if I asked you where would you rather have your money and I gave you these two options you know what you should be doing right in terms of asset allocation you should be putting more of your money in bonds because you are getting a two percent spread on the safe Bond and putting it out strong and 2007 you'd be doing the exact opposite now one of my problems with the way financial markets are structured is you get a job you get put into a segment of the market you get tunnel vision Equity people talk to equity people fixed income people talk to fixed income people and sometimes you can have the two markets diverging and they're not even talking to each other there's a benefit to stepping back and getting that big picture perspective what's the equity of screen what's the default spread are they diverging why are they diverging what can I as an investor do about the Divergence 2022 they converged they did the same thing but keep watching who knows what they will do in 2023 so the price of risk in the equity Market is the equity risk premium the price of risk in the bond market is the default spread what about the real estate market do you think there's a risk premium in there anybody work in real estate or have a you know have a family business associated with real estate you know what a cap rate is anybody want to tell me what a cap rate in real estate is evaporated it's a capitalization rate it's a fancy word for if you give me the rental income on a property this is the rate that I use to capitalize it so if you have a 10 cap rate you have income of a million you'll be willing to pay 10 million for a property because you get a million on the 10 million a cap rate is like a cost of equity that real estate developers demand and there are services like CBRE reports a cap rate on average over time and in this graph the next graph here's what I've done I've taken sorry I've taken the cap Ritz from the CBRE database I've subtracted out the risk-free rate and essentially the green line is a risk premium on the real estate market and it tells you a story that I think should change the way real estate is taught and dealt with an investing when I was taking my classes and investing you know what I was told I was told that if you have your money in financial assets you should buy real estate why because it moves in different ways than financial assets now I got my MBA in the nine in the early 80s and in the 1980s that was true take a look at what the the real estate it's behaving in it's a different asset class notice that something seems to have happened in the last 20 to 25 years the risk premium on real estate is starting to look like the risk premium and stocks and the risk premium and bonds and this is really bad news for all of us because you know what it means right you own a house you got two million dollars invested in mutual funds you have a bad year on stocks and you're a million in bonds so you have a bad year on stocks is it down 20 you took the bond market down 15 then you look at your house and you know what you're going to see right it's also down 15 real estate is no longer operating as an asset class why might that be what did we do to screw up real estate that's made it stop being this different asset class celebrated what we did to screw it up actually it's probably taught in business schools that this is what we need to do what do we do we securitized it lure andieri in probably the 1980s remember real estate was a private business you paid alone Banks made loans and then came a man called lure and Yuri he was a Solomon brilliant man and he said all these billions of dollars of mortgages nobody's trading them because Banks hold them they sit in their portfolios what if we bundle them and issued mortgage-backed securities amazing innovation and then wave after wave more and more of real estate to try to get securitized and one of the things that seems to happen when you securitize something is it starts to behave like a financial asset it's made our lives more difficult right the easy way to diversify is not gone just because you bought a house or an apartment you thought you were safe that's no longer true so it'll be good to track these risk premiums by markets because when somebody says Bitcoin that's a great investment it's going to buffer your portfolio what's the new thing you put up the I'll wager if you put up Equity risk you're going to get Bitcoin moving like stocks and bonds in fact it behaves like very risky stock and implied Equity risk premiums then become the basis for asking a question is my company under over value now I when I walk into investment Banks and most you know I don't do this very much anymore partly because I don't like to dress up it's uh you know everybody uses historical risk previews and the defense they offer is it doesn't matter we all use the same number let's see if that's enough of a defense for instance let's assume that every analyst in your group uses the arithmetic average historical risk premium of 8.17 percent to come up with cost of equity for competition in other words they're doing it because and it's the same number everybody's using the same number and let's say the implied Equity risk premium is 5.94 percent salary 2023 5.94 what do these analysts going to consistently find if they're using an 8.12 premium in the market premiums are they going to find most companies to be overvalued or most companies to be under that think through the map you use too high a premium you're going to end up with too higher discount rate you end up with too higher discount rate you're going to come up with a value that's low and you're going to say that looks overvalued that looks overvalued do you see where I'm going sometimes when you see people say a stock is undervalued you might want to check out the equity of screen they're using a four percent equity risk premium right now you know why they're finding the stock to be undervalued it's got nothing to do with the stock they think the S P 500 should be 30 higher than it is today and if they're right on that why the heck are you buying a stock right go buy the index and buy index Futures whenever you use a premium that deviates from the current implied premium you're bringing a market view into your valuation what do you think about markets and that's not a good place to be right I want you to Value Coca-Cola not value Coca-Cola and tell me what you think about the S P 500 at the same time so let me summarize my case for implied premiums rather than backward looking I'm forward looking we can debate whether I'm getting the estimates right but I care about future cash flows not past cash flows rather than sticking with the number no matter what happens I am updating the number it's dynamic But ultimately the test of a good estimate of the equity is cream it's got to be a good estimate what actually happens in the future right so every year I do this manuscript that's the best way I can describe it where I take everything I know about Equity risk crimes and I'm going to send you that link as well it's 143 pages use it to fall asleep it's incredibly boring but I take everything and I look at historical and at the end in the last section here's what I do I present you the six or seven different ways some people use earnings to price ratios to get in place it's called the FED model to get in I take all these models and ask a simple question which of these is the best estimate of returns in the next five years in the next 10 years because ultimately that's what a good Equity risk cream should do right be a good predictor so what do you want when you do this correlation you want a high positive correlation between what you estimate and what actually gets delivered so here I have four choices you can use the current implied premium which right now be 5.94 people seem to feel more comfortable smoothing things out something about smoothing things out makes them feel that this is a more reliable number so people use averages of my numbers they take the last five years think of that as an average implied premium you could use a historical risk premium which is what 90 of people do by looking at the last hundred years and there are some people actually take the default spread on the bwa rated Bond and over history the equator disc brings roughly two times that number this is multiplied by two and I look at the correlation between those forecasts and what the actual return is next year the next five years in the next 10 years so what do I want I want a high positive correlation let's debate the best positive correlations but there's one stand out here in terms of being a terrible predictor right which is the worst way you can use to estimate future returns the heck is wrong with people they use they use an estimate the that is almost Gary guarishable answer it's not that the correlation is slow it's negative so when historical premiums are high your expected premiums and stocks are actually lowest my final argument for implied Equity risk premium is nothing to do with Theory it works better than using this backward looking static number I used to think about using averages of implied premiums I said maybe because you get these months where it jumps around and the data convinced me not to go that route because it said you're gaining nothing and you're actually losing a little you don't like to do implied frames go with the default spread times too I'll take that over the historical premium every single day so as you think about Equity risk premiums open the door to this possibility because you're going to have to have this argument with people you go work for because they're going to be trained in historical premiums they're going to come into this 300 Page book on historical returns used to be published by Duffin Phelps now it's published by the service called Crow and slices and dices historical data and gives you premiums to the third decimal point and never once is the what standard error ever mentioned in the book but that's a statistical drop out there right but you'll have to convince people about I've been trying for 30 years right and I'm having some success but it's a really long right because people are so used to doing this it's the safest place to be is where everybody else is but I want you to open the door to at least thinking about implied premiums I'll give you one other advantage of implied premiums what was the reason I could not compute a historical risk premium for Vietnam there's not enough history right in fact that's going to be true for a lot of emerging markets around the world what do I need for an implied premium I need a level of the index today which I should be able to get for any Market I need cash flows last year which I should be able to get for any Market I just have to add up the numbers I do need an expected growth rate for the next five years that's tricky where markets like Ghana or Zimbabwe because there aren't that many analysts making forecasts so that's tricky but you know that's that's an estimation challenge but you could potentially compute an implied Equity risk premium for every traded Market in the world right you can forget that remember that page I showed you with default spreads multiplied by relative volatility skip all of that just low implied premium then the implied premium in China I can't wait for that day to arrive because that'll mean I have premiums that actually reflect what people are demanding in that market because right now it's a little artificial right they take the US premium I take the default spread I do this elaborate dance I might convince you I might not convince you but this way you bypass what are people paying so this was actually in in 2007 I wanted to compute the implied Equity risk premium in the sensex the Indian Equity index so I got the level of the index and in 2007 Indian companies weren't buying back stocks all dividends so they're actually a little easier to get the cash flows because I just added up the dividends and for the growth rate I cheated most Indian companies you didn't have five-year growth rates but about half of the companies in the censex are what are called adrs which are listed in the US or gdrs to listen to UK and in those stocks I was able to find five-year forecast I know this is cutting and pasting together I took that growth rate and plugged it in as my growth rate for the next five years and because my risk free rate was six in this case was six point seven six percent I said that as my growth rate beyond your five so I'm doing with the sensex exactly what I did with the s p 500. same mechanical process I solve for r i get an expected return of 11.18 so what does that tell me at the star in in September of 2007 given how Indian stocks were priced my expected risk premium in India is 11.18 minus 6.764.42 percent I'll tell you why I think this might be worth doing the approach I described last session where I took the mature Market premium and then added the default spread is built on the presumption that money can be moved across markets right so the premium in India is too low I take my money out of India and I put it in the U.S and in parts of the world where you can invest anywhere the U.S you can invest your money in German stocks and if you're in Germany you can invest your money in U.S stocks if you're Canadian you can invest your money in Indonesian stocks and if you're Indian can you invest your money anywhere you want a little more easily than you were able to do 20 years ago but it's still really really really difficult to do you see where I'm going right you have a market where investors are kind of hand in pending in what sense you have a choice you want to buy Indian stocks so you want to buy Indian stocks say but Indian stocks are overvalued I mean as you can you want to buy Indian stocks you want to buy Indian stocks do you see what can happen if you pen in a market the end the equity risk cream can actually drop below what it is in the US or what do you think is a safer market and you have no choice you're stuck with this Market it's not healthy because you know what happens right you create bubbles inside the market because there's no place to go but even in a market like India at some point in time people say I'm getting a three percent premium two and a half percent premium I'm pulling my money out of equities and gets where they go They're going to Real Estate the bubble kind of moves around because equities and there's real estate real estate crashes I guess they buy gold this is a recipe for unhealthy Behavior it's true in India it's partly true in mainland China has been wrestling with how do we open up the conduits for Mainland Chinese to invest in Hong Kong stocks forget about U.S stocks and they opened the conduit add things up let me close it up again what when Indian China was small economies this was not a big deal right you could do this nobody cared but we have the second largest and the fifth largest economy in the world this is like a powder keg waiting to blow up somewhere along the way you got to ease the process for people to be able to invest outside it's going to have consequences right initially you're going to sell off all those overpriced Asian paints nice company but what the heck am I paying 46 times earnings for a company that's getting closer to mature than high growth because I have no choice maybe we need to revalue a Donnie with what an Indian Equity risk right now I think Indianapolis premiums imply the premiums are lower than U.S premiums because Indian stocks have done so well through 2021 and 2022 they did well in 20 much better in 2022 than any other Market if you ask me why are people paying 4 000 rupees per share for that stock the answer might be because they have no place to go okay so implied premiums allow you to make the judgment and one final point about equatorial scrims and we'll shut the door on this topic I actually at the startup every year right now this 47 000 I break them out and I have to make some judgment calls and develop markets and Emerging Markets you're right I have to make some you know which Portugal go on to developer emerging markets and based on this very generic breakdown I compute the implied cost of equity so just like I did for the s p fund for developed market stocks collectively and for emerging market stocks collected he's saying what are you trying to do I'm trying to estimate what the market is charging as a premium and that's what the last column is for investing in emerging market stocks so you go back to 2004 collectively emerging and these are all in dollar terms you're comparing Apple Storage Apples to Apples start of 2004 the differential was 3.27 investors were charging 3.27 percent more for investing in Emerging Market companies and in developed Market companies do you think that makes sense I'm not even sure it would make sense it doesn't make sense but look at the trend line of that number as you go through time 2004 2005 it keeps dropping 2008 is a little bounce back up that's a crisis pushing the premium up but by 2012 investors were pricing emerging market stocks just like they were doing developers they were charging notice premium and the story was after 2008 there are no developed markets and Emerging Markets are all the same we don't and then in the years after of course you get this wake-up call there's still something emerging about emerging markets that you have to price in but if you are an asset allocator your portfolio man is saying where should I put my money should I go into Emerging Markets this might be a number to track right because you want to go into Emerging Markets when this differential is wide enough that you feel you're being rewarded for the extra risk so the implied approach actually gives you a way of reverse engineering what you can make as an expected return and saying where do I go to get the most bang for my the highest return for the risk I take and looking across markets geographically looking across asset classes you can get a better sense of hey these are the classes that deliver the highest returns any questions on implied equitator Scripts so you're ready for the Greek alphabet to start there is no more misunderstood Concept in in finance than beta but people who like it and dislike it seem to have no idea what they're liking or disliking but you've all seen right in every Finance first finance class you're showing how you get betas you run a regression of returns in the stock against returns in the market index the slope of the line is the beta what a terrible way to think about base because you know already what you've done you convert it into a statistical number you're under regression you get the slope you get a beta just as I dug a whole and buried historical restrooms I'm going to dig an even deeper hole and bury this notion that betas come from regression and there are three arguments I'm going to make against regression beta so if this happens everything you've been taught in previous Finance classes I don't care because it deserves to be appended first I'm going to argue that somehow in finance we seem to forget Statistics over and over again you run a regression in statistics class and you get it slow what do you require to show in Brackets below the slope either a t statistic or a standard error right when did we stop doing that so when you tell me the beta is 1.23 I'm waiting for hey what's the standard error and you never seem to mention it second is it backward looking how do I run regression returns for the next five years against my how can I get return to the next five years I get it for the last five years it's the ultimate backward looking number right and if your business mix has changed God help me even address the regression it's giving me a beta for the last five years and I'm going to argue that betas are affected by how much debt you have Equity becomes riskier for any firm if you borrow more money and companies debt to equity ratios change the beta changes so let me back up these statements by pulling up traditional regression beta pages you guys have access to Bloomberg terminal right somewhere in this floor is it you've never found it it's that so keep looking you'll find it it's well worth finding because it's in every Investment Bank right it's become this attachment to the world without a Bloomberg terminal you haven't arrived and it's a neat little device to have on your desk because you type in the name of any company and you type in beta it'll show you the beta page for the company you no longer have to run to yourself the regression is run for you so this is the beta page for a company called GoPro you know what GoPro did what do they make cameras for hyperactive over sharing individuals right basically you know they put the GoPro on their head and they go on a three hour hike and they're caught the whole damn thing as if you care they're eating their lunch 45 minutes goproing the whole thing it's disgusting actually watch somebody eat for 45 minutes but for a while it was this glorious success story we're all going to GoPro they talked about how they were going to you know create entertainment you know where's that second thoughts about how can this be entertainment it's brought down the word but I decided so it was about a year and a half into its you know into its Public Market life I decided I wanted to see what the beta for GoPro looked like so I went to Bloomberg typed in GoPro typed in beta that's the beta page it's like magic there's a raw beta 1.604 this is great I've got my Beta right third decimal point but remember your statistics keep going down oh standard error beta 0.50 somebody help me out here I get a regression beta 1.60 with a standard error of 0.50 and actually what's the fair beta for GoPro what's the range you're going to give me that's with 67 confidence you like 67 confidence I can see with 95 confidence you're going to basically go no now it's actually 95 plus or minus two standard errors to the true you know number can be 0.6 to 2.6 how does that even help me and are you surprised that's what I mean by noise now part of this thing but what about the adjusted beta sounds sophisticated right your visions of five people at Bloomberg sitting around table let's adjust the beta so I'm going to give away the secret as to what exactly the adjustment is it's two-thirds times the raw beta plus one third times one if you don't believe me print out the betas for forty thousand companies try every single one of the companies it's two-thirds times the raw beta you're saying what see raw bait is one point five two thirds of one point five is one one third of one is point three three your one point five will become one point three three one point two will become 1.13 as I go through each of these look to see if you see a pattern 1.8 is going to become one point five three point six is going to become 0.73 so what are they doing to betas they're getting the raw paid and pushing it towards one what's so magical about one it's average made across they're trying to be helpful they think as your company gets bigger and it it's beta will probably move to the Twitchy responsibility please stop helping because why should these two thirds and one-third weights it must be magical to work on 47 000 companies right so first time I encountered this I decided to call Bloomberg not the mayor but the company a long time in New York that was very confusing when I said Bloomberg do you call the man no it's his company maybe I should have called the mayor they I called him and I said look I want to talk to somebody about your beta page it's they put me in touch with the beta calculation guy there is a guy at Bloomberg whose life it is to maintain this page can you imagine how exciting his life must be he goes to cocktail but I'm the beta guy from Bloomberg dozens of people gather around for anecdotes right not the guy's pathetically grateful to get a call from the outside world I don't know what they do to maybe they keep him locked up in a basement room and feed him through a hole in the wall he said I'm so glad you called I all day to answer your questions I didn't have all day to ask him questions but I was afraid that if I hung up the phone too soon he might do something rash so after about a few minutes of polite conversation about how much I like Bloomberg terminals which I don't but I had to make I hit him with a question why two-thirds and one-third he said huh two minutes of silence I can hear terminals being turned off and on papers being wrestled comes back two minutes later I don't know it was here when I got here I said what what does that even mean he was hired two years ago it was already built in don't blame me I'm saying I'm not trying to blame you I just want to know where these numbers come from here when I got here you know how often you're going to get that answer to questions you ask at your work about numbers used every day why are we using a five percent equity ice cream for the U.S I don't know here when I got here when did he get here 1981 you've never asked I don't pick up rocks and look at what's under them in a long-winded way I'm saying there's absolutely no information in an adjusted beta all it's telling you is which direction one is and if you're having trouble with that what the heck are you doing doing valuation in the first place right if you're at 1.5 you know how you get to one you go 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.11 you're there I don't need somebody holding my hand saying let me push you closer to one you seem a little confused it's noisy and that Justin Bieber doesn't do much but once in a while you will get a great looking beta you're going to start celebrating the best looking beta page ever beta page I printed off for Nokia like 2001. at that time Blue Book actually used to report the adjusted beta they seem to have removed it from maybe they want to leave an air of mystery as to what the adjustment is because that's still the adjustment that's look at r squared of 93 standard or close to zero this is a statistics class I'd get a gold medal right but before you get too excited why does Nokia's beta look so good what what is the beta measure it comes from a regression of returns in the stock against Returns on a market index right but GoPro that was the S P 500 for Nokia it's the hex I thought that was a Witch's Curse until I ran the regression you know what the heck stands for right it's a Helsinki exchange you're saying what the heck is Bloomberg going to Helsinki for Nokia is a Finnish company Bloomberg is very parochial about the way it estimates betas you go look up the beta for a Chinese stock it'll be against the Shenzhen if it's listed in this you know in the Shanghai exchange or it can be against that not if you take a Hong Kong so whatever stock you pick they'll pick the local exchange you think so what I'll make a confession I had no idea what was in the hex so I decide take a look and I wish I had not because in 2001 I think Nokia owned Finland it was like 80 percent off the index at which point you got to ask what the heck is this regression it's a regression of Nokia against Nokia and what did we find an awful lot of the time the two moved together congratulations this is amazing I never thought this would happen you run gas prom you get the same phenomenon because it dominates the Russian index and the problem is once you leave the US most indices that get used Dax 30 stocks cic30 stocks are narrow indices which makes their betas completely nonsensical because the marginal investor in Nokia in 2001 was Barclays they bought it for their Global Index Fund and if you're buying you know Nokia for your Global Index Fund you know how you measure risk right you don't measure it against the hex you measure it against the msci or a global index if you measure beta right you will never get a regression like this one if you measure beta wrong all bets are off which leaves me with uh issue though and this will be the final point for today is your beta reflects a slice of History right and if something abnormal happens during that period your beta will show it remember betas water betas measures they measure how you move with the market they're not a measure of all eternity they measure of correlation so if something happens it makes your stock either go up no matter what or go down no matter what guess what it does to your betas it makes your betas go down so if I take for instance GameStop and this is at the peak of that craziness you know what happened to that beta it went to minus point the let's take the raw beta minus 0.08 he's saying what happened what happened during that that craziness people kept buying stocks no matter what or selling stocks no matter what you have nothing to do with the market anymore and since beta measures how you move with the market when things happen to a company that are I'll bet that adani's beta two weeks from now would be lower than it was before they went to the crisis completely counter-intuitive but from a statistical standpoint you can see exactly what's going on last page I told you the last page was the last page but this is really the last page you know why analysts love betas I tell people look you give me a Bloomberg terminal 30 minutes and tell me what beta you want for your company I will deliver a printed page with that data try it out get on a Bloomberg you can change the index you can change the starting point the ending point daily weekly which means that what you see as a printed beta page on Bloomberg might just be the 54th iteration that this person tried and said this is the beta for the company so when we get back on Monday we're going to talk about what to do instead because we've dug the gray for Betas we're going to bury it and they say Well there must be a different way of thinking about it you could do hardly anything in finance what made you like to teachers but if I didn't teach Finance I wouldn't be working in finance I'd be teaching science I'd be teaching math I'll be teaching literature so my first love is Teachers that's that's my passion Finance happens to be a subject I enjoy teaching but if you ask me to rank which do you which is the bigger passion teaching is my passion Finance is not a passion if an interest okay same because you got to pick what you came you know in life what gives you the most joy and to me the joy comes from preaching it doesn't come from I mean I like Finance I enjoy Financial progress but whenever you enjoy something everything I do is intention of that basis you got to decide in your life what rank what what you value the most and you've got to find a way to do that while making a living as well right premium on average over the last 62 years five percent premium the last 20 years this is a market price for risk right it can't be a good number there can be a number that is not out of out of sync with what people accept over time it's all you can that's why I have that graph of overtime whatever those premium look like relative to the last 20 years the last 10 years the last 50 years but that's all you can do yeah otherwise there's no there's no theoretical answer right yeah it's really the function of what you settle for thank you um I was wondering uh what is kind of what um to kind of calculate maybe a health sector like like uh Equity risk premiums like I did the same thing right I've actually considered adding it to have so many things to do in the first five days of the year that I've thought about it and not done it but next year I might do my sector level s p has eight sectors that is indices for the sectors and earnings and cash flows you can download it's a little Messier because unlike the S P 500 it's already there on the as no but I have with s p Capital IQ you can take all energy stocks out of their earnings out of their cash flows you can do an implied Equity risk premium for energy companies and implied and if you do that you can skip the beta part right because then you can go directly and add that Equity with me there is free rate you got your cost of battery so with those people who don't like bagels and I know quite a few people refuse to pay they they deny it I don't like it I say okay you don't like betas here's what you need to do get an implied cost of equity for energy stock and value and energy companies that implied cost of equity there's no beta so if people are caught up in I don't like modern portfolio Theory I don't write critical return models this is a solution which is it's completely pragmatic it's agnostic about not it's got nothing to do with models but the numbers are there that's the reason I you know I I gave and I think access to capitalize is so useful because you do need access to a raw database you're not going to be able to look it up because you can do shortcuts some people use earnings to price ratios and if you make some assumptions the earnings price ratio becomes a proxy for the cost of equity in that sector but it's it's messy it ignores growth it you know lots of things are missing so this you know and you can take the same spreadsheet I would send you for the S P 500 just use it for any sector it'll work those the spreadsheet itself is malleable enough to be able but the collecting of the cash flow data is going to be the part that you have to go to capitalize you and do what again it's not even taking you just have to download it right basically take all energy companies download net income dividends BuyBacks they're all on Capital IQ aggregate the numbers that will give you the collective dividends in Buybacks in the last year from those companies so it's actually not even digging it's just downloading into a spreadsheet aggregating the numbers and using those aggregated numbers when you compute the implied expected return and I guess kind of a quick little second question um well I mean you know we are a business owner and so um do you think like there's a way that like eventually people are going to become more pragmatic about using different methods like kind of because the risk of us thing to do is to actually do what everybody else is doing even if it's wrong this is not a question of fragmented it's survival right in fact it's more risky doing the right thing if it deviates from historic Norm because we do the wrong thing that everybody else is doing when things go wrong or things don't work out you say look I no I just did I use historical risk premiums maybe they were too low but everybody doesn't so unfortunately the reality of how reward and punishment is meted out is not based on how you're doing the right thing I don't know you're doing the defensible thing right and I think that's why you see bad in a way I describe it as bad practices once they get into valuation never leave they become embedded because it becomes safer for you to continue with those bad practices because you can always use the defensive everybody uses that small cap ring you know I don't think there's one anymore but everybody else uses it so I'm going to continue to use it and do you think that that's going that changes maybe that's human nature right I mean I there'll be some people who will change but there will be people who have extra money at play right because if you're an appraiser you're an analyst you have no incentive to change it's not like you get an upside for being right here yeah you know you just punish for being wrong but if you're investing your own money you might say look this is crazy that I'm getting the same premium investing in bonds as I'm investing in stocks I'm going to start a hedge fund I'm going to sell short in stocks and and that's exactly what John I mean this room is funded by somebody who looked at real estate risk premiums you might not have used my Approach and he said this is absurd I'm going to sell short in real estate and that was something you had to be creative about and the money you made is what paid for this not just this room but the entire building right so what it does mean is for people are willing to think out of the box and usually they're doing it because they're greedy let's be quite clear they're doing it because they want to make money on it this becomes a way of saying everybody else can do whatever they want but an investment Bank you know they have a different set of objectives they don't make money on being right or wrong they make money on getting Deals they make money and you know but I make money on betting on Market mistakes and this looks like a market mistake to me so I think that's the niche that and most hedge funds are just like in like investment Banks they follow the herd they they get price they get you know but there are some that I think you know stand out because they're willing to say look you know we're not going to do what everybody else does and now we have the instruments to trade our mistakes right for the longest time real estate was overvalued what are you going to do okay so you could you could sell short your neighbor's house right it's not exactly doable but we have the instruments now to take advantage of Market mistakes so I think there's a payoff to not thinking in the box but no but if you have a job that payoff is not on your job it might show up elsewhere right yeah somebody else like Computing the sector expected returns I think it's a great idea I think companies need to be valued you try it in the South Side equity research house or an appraiser you're going to be shouted down because you said that's not the way we do it we have a discrete we have a beta we have an equity risk green we got from crawl and Duff and Phelps we had a small cap premium we had a company specific risk premium we come with 21 you're asking us to use 12 that doesn't sound right we're going to go to 21 so don't expect an easy you know audience even if you get the number but I think it's well worth doing yeah all right thank you foreign so I know it's like one of these slides you had where it seems like a big part is just estimating the percentage is it a biotech with no Revenue single product working its way through how how late in the pipeline is the product this is for a diabetes drug that's not even passed through the first stage yeah the further you get towards the end the more you will have more conventional DCF okay so it depends on where they are in the approval process if they've gone through the third stage of the approval process basically about estimating potential Market revenues growth more like a conventional valuation okay if they're in stage one then you got to estimate now what's the chances that there will be and you know you love today you know that would require going and looking at whatever's been written about the drug there will I mean this is not a process but the first ones going through this and you can look at the FDA actually it's public information they will tell you what percentage of drugs working through each stage of the pipeline make it to the next stage so first check where their where their drugs are in the pipeline you might not need a decision tree if they've already made it all the way to the production stage okay now in which case your system more conventional you know forecast the market for the drug forecast the pricing I'm not saying any of those are easy to do because when you're talking about a you know it could be like harder than a normal company it is hard it is harder than a normal company because it requires some medical knowledge right some knowledge I mean you can't value a company that is a drug for Cystic Fibrosis if you don't know how many Americans have it what percentage of those Americans actually can afford the drugs what other drugs are in the market so you're right but it's research I've interviewed if I did Coca-Cola I'd have but the research when you do cystic fibrosis is not something you're going to be able to read up you know easily on Google search or make a you know gut feeling conclusion it will require delving through it's it's in the public domain but you'll have to read through a journal article on a drug which talks about you know why this drug is better than the other three drugs so yeah you should be able I mean I mean let's face it your Competitive Edge has to be that you can bring to the sector knowledge that most people who are novices cannot bring in that you're aware of this process you can think about a drug being developed you can think about you know how drugs get approved and not approved and you know so you are working on a competitive event doesn't mean that it's going to be easy but it'll mean that you're building up your that that that that that niche you're connecting your your bio knowledge with valuation and I think that's the payoff you're looking for um but yeah so I had two different companies I was looking at one like actually has a decent amount of like later stage pipeline stuff and then one is it has I would go with the first one the second one is going to be too much it'll be a single drug it's less a company and more a drug because I guess my guess is many of the companies that look like your second one never make it as going concerned they get bought out by some large Pharma company because that's the way Pharma is evolving is a let some young company develop a drug get it all the way to through the approval process but actually taking it from there into commercial development requires a huge amount of investment in sales people and and many of these young companies don't want to do it they don't have the resources to do it so they go to option and say what do you want a cerebral palsy drug you know we worked it through the pipeline and they cash out and they go back to basic Rd so they can work on the next truck so it becomes not uh you're with the second company my fear is you're going to end up pricing or valuing something that's going to end up being a single product rather than a company okay yeah that makes sense yeah and so if they only had like a few years of cash flows then they have it right to the extent that you're forecasting the few years can help but even if you had no years of cash flows you'd still be forecasting right okay sounds good uh so for the like estimated if it's like phase two or something you just get like sort of a General market like percentage Yeah I would wouldn't get to remember the more of a portfolio you have the less payoff there is to breaking it down into individual elements I would never take a Mark or an uptrend or advisor and break down it's it's revenues by drug it's not worthy Apple because you're actually better off forecasting the aggregated number than you are individual numbers it's one of the strange phenomena in forecasting is uh aggregating a bunch of items that you're uncertain about will actually give you a better shot of getting a better estimate they're trying to forecast each individual item even when there's only like three or four items or when well when the larger the number the less pale but if there's only three or four you can then break out the three or four and do it but then remember it's a company as long as it's an ongoing company there's a pipeline and so the part that you will not catch is there will be future drugs that come out of this Pipeline and that's going to be built into your value as well so at the end of the process even if you get all poor drugs they have valued and add them up it might not be the value of the company because people might attach a premium to the fact that they have the great r d Department that's worked on these four drugs and remember when you're successful with a drug it gives you these little offshoots that you can use to develop like moderna the MRNA no it's good no I'm going to create a vaccine and revenues but the basic technology they're already thinking about where else can we use it what other drugs can we put it in you know build on it so that's what you will miss when you do a so remember we talked about some of the assets that's one of the diversions we talked about you can value companies as some of its pieces you're in a sense valuing a drug company is a sum of its pieces and you're trying to Value each piece separately and that's okay but there is an invisible piece of continuing research continuing to throw things out and you have to bring that in as well okay yeah yeah um what's his name oh Joe and Jason Jason to Jason Gray I'll just use this question he said he took my class last year oh yeah I don't know what to do today yeah thank you so much you're welcome one of my friends and dads actually was in one of your MBA classes oh wow since the 1989 class A very early class I was three years into my teaching day 
thank you everybody else pretty good exactly this isn't a MAG safe right I'll be very careful if somebody trips are going to take your computer down with you okay folks almost time so I were waiting for the almost time my two questions who's not in a group yet I don't see a single hand go up everybody's in a group or you're too ashamed and don't admit it okay who's not picked a company yet come on be honest really this doesn't match up to your master list that I looked at this morning I mean if I believe that list it's like what 60 of you have not picked company so either the list is lying or you're lying um maybe the people are now lying on it that's always a convenient excuse but there'll be an awful lot of people so if you pick the company and you haven't entered the company's name on the list please do you're not locked in it's not etched in stone you can change your mind just do me a favor just put the company's name down at least you can get started the worst thing you can do is not get started so pick a company get started you can change your mind okay so let's talk about betas you know I kind of dug a hole for regression betas buried them deep and hopefully today we will leave them there so they don't come back like The Walking Dead okay but let me tell you all the things I do in valuation the one thing I get the most pushback on is betish in fact there are some parts some audiences all I have to say is beta and I've lost them for the rest of the session they've decided nothing else is worth listening to so given that so many different people disagree with user beta don't trust it I'm going to give you a chance if you don't trust betas yeah to take your choice on why you don't trust Believers because I might be able to give you a solution so I'll give you four reasons why people give for I don't want to use betas first is that they don't think they should be adjusting discount rates for risk surprisingly large percent of people who don't want to use betas want to use one cost of capital ten percent for every company nine percent where they come up with that number I have no idea they're like idiot savants you know they go oh my God I can is that even politically correct whatever the right politically correct term is they're like Dustin Hoffman in the Rain Man lay on nine percent I know that's a cost of capital every company if you want to go that route and you want to use one discount rate one cost of equity for every company what should you be using when we did the implied Equity risk premium in this you know what do we do we back out from the index and we say right now given how stocks are priced if you want to use one cost of equity at least have the good sense to adjust it over time because the number is going to move around but I think it's extremely dangerous because we know some companies are riskier than others here's the second choice and this actually does make sense from a consistency standpoint what are we trying to do an entrance evaluation we're trying to make our judgment and what a company's word and not be influenced by trading in the market by pricing factors right that's why we do entrance evaluation well but how do we get betas by looking at returns which come from crisis the argument is why we're using a pricing measure of risk when we're doing intrinsic valuation that's what in when I do this session in Omaha and I do it before I don't go to the actual meeting I do it for the people the true believers who come this is the biggest stumbling point which is I don't believe price is why so maybe that's the reason you don't like a price based measure of risk and I think that makes internal sense in terms of what you're trying to do the third is you don't have a problem using prices but you don't like the implicit assumption we make when we use beta is that only the risk you cannot diversify the way it matters right because implicitly that's what beta measures it doesn't measure total risk but risk you cannot diversify maybe you don't like that assumption and here's the fourth one you're okay with both the pricing and the diversification argument you just don't like the statistical noise and the backward looking nature of regression leaders on the fourth one I can give you a solution it's easy but I'm going to start today by talking about choices you have if your promise would know two or three which is you don't like the pricing approach and you don't like that I'll give you a way of getting around it don't let this be you're done where you say look I don't like betas therefore I will not do valuation so I'll give you alternatives to betas you can use them you cannot use them so if you run into people say I don't like betas be willing to be flexible and say okay I'll use a different approach to risk because to me this is a small piece and a much bigger puzzle before I you know the other thing I want to talk about very quickly to put regression betas to rest is sometimes people think when they're estimating betas they're doing statistics it may explain this is a company called you know petrobras big Brazilian Oil Company I've estimated two betas for it one is the beta game supervispa and the second is the beta that I got by using the ADR which is its listing in the US against the s p 500. I've given you betas a very different I've given you the r squared and the standard errors the betas to ask you which of these two betas is better anybody want to make a pick and tell me why because that's higher r squared right the statistics class aren't we taught that a higher r squared is better than a lower r squared a load and mathematically that seems reasonable right but think of why the the debate against the purpose against the whisper is more precise the one against the S P 500 what is it about it yeah it's a big part of the index right it's like Nokia perhaps not as much dominant as Nokia is but if your end game becomes I want to get the highest r squared beta you will find it it'll be a terrible estimate of your beta but it'll make you feel comfortable don't make this an exercise of increasing our square if you get a chance you get on a Bloomberg terminal have you found one yet there must be some you know I don't even know where I don't even have the energy to go looking anymore they're there somewhere one of the nice things about Bloomberg is you type the beta for your you know type in beta for your company you'll see that page and you can start changing things change the index you can change starting point ending point and if your objective becomes increasing your r squared you will get there but if your end gate is incorrect you're not going to get a beta that matters it's going to be a beta that looks better in a statistical word so I'm going to go back to the main packet and I think we're on page 83 Maybe yeah I think we're on page 83. and give you some options and these are options you might want to use but have them as options in case you run into somebody says I don't like this beta thing do something different so the way I'm going to divide the options is I'm going to ask you what your problem with betas is because this is exactly the question to ask in Omaha you don't like betas tell me what it is about betas that bother you about two-thirds of people say it's the fact that you're using pass prices okay so I'll take prices out of the mix but if I take prices out it makes I have to use something else to estimate risk right what's the most obvious if you think in intrinsic terms what might be a better measure of intrinsic risk instead of stock prices thanks right so you can look at earnings over time and risky companies should have more volatile earnings and say if a company should have more stable earnings everybody agree with that and I've tried it in fact it's not difficult to do I compute the standard deviation earnings for every company that's publicly traded and I don't trust standard deviations and earnings for a very simple reason what do what are accountants trained to do when you get distortions smooth them out right so you have an expense you spread it out over time I understand why they're doing it but the nature of accounting is to smooth things out over time this is where I'm going when you have a risky company accountants will counter that riskiness by smoothing things up I wish I could tell you that companies with more wallet learnings are riskier but that's not what I see in the evidence but if you want to go that route I'll go with the route and I'm going to give you something that looks like abated yes it'll work I'll compute the standard deviation in earnings let's say it's 40 I'll compute the standard deviation earnings for every other company in the market let's say it's 30 percent you know what I'm going to do I'm going to take the 40 divided by 30 I'm going to give you 1.3 it looks like a beta right but it's based on accounting earnings so there are people who use accounting earnings but remember earnings are measure only once every quarter in the U.S you can only get four observations per year so if your company's been around only three years you'll have 12 observations they get smoothed out and sometimes they do strange things unexpected charges extraordinary charges so it's not a Panacea but if that makes you feel better I'll go along with lyrics here's a second way in which you can come up with a cost of equity you have a cause to death that might be observable Banks lend you money of an interest rate you can say look I don't want to play these games I'm just going to take the interest rate at which I borrow money and if I'm a risky company and have a high cost of debt I'll also have a high cost of equity makes sense right intuitively for some companies if you're a very risky tech company with no debt this approach you're going to say well there's no cost of debt so your Equity must be pretty low cost of equity must be pretty low the problem with this approach is you're effectively going to it's going to work maybe for infrastructure companies with a lot of debt but with most other companies a cost of debt-based estimate of the cost of equity doesn't make much sense I'm not trying to talk you out of it but I'm saying there's no there's no alternative here that's perfect every alternative you pick is going to come with cost you got to decide what you're poisonous so when you think about no if the price-based measures you don't believe them then of course you can go if you stay with price-based measures you say I believe them and you don't like the cap that's your the the battle you want to fight then Finance is lots of Alternatives Arbitrage pricing model multi-factor model essentially you're staying with price-based measures but coming up with the cost of equity so if you want to use an Arbitrage pricing model or a multi-factor model to estimate your cost of equity am I going to fight you no I don't think it's going to make much of a difference to your eventual valuation if it makes you feel better I'm okay with it let's move to the other half what if you don't want to make the diversification assumption so when you when you don't want to assume that investors are Diversified then again I'm going to ask you okay if investors you don't worry if you don't want to make make that assumption are you okay with price-based measures if you say yes then I have a simple solution to the beta prompt beta look at only the portion of your variance that is due to the market that's what a covariance and that regression that's kind of hidden in the regression I'm going to take your total standard deviation a little later in this class we're going to come back and talk I call this a total beta so what I do is I look at your last three years of stock prices your standard deviation in stock prices is 50 percent and the typical U.S stock a standard deviation of 20 I'm going to divide the 50 by the 20. I'm going to come eventually I want to come up with a number that looks like a beta right there's an advantage to having a number scale around one but if you were to get a chance to explore those there are a dozen different ways I can estimate cost of equity that don't require a beta and I need to move on so if this is where you make an issue I no I don't like beta as a measure risk I have Solutions so when you look at alternative models you can bundle them into either relative standard deviation models we look at total risk you can look at what I call proxy models and proxy models you tell me what type of company you have small company lots of physical assets I'll give you a cost of equity based on your care that's what a proxy model does in fact one way a proxy model works is you tell me what sector you're in technology I'll give you a 12 cost of equity why because I think technology companies are risky and finally if you want in some cases you can take the model that we went at risk-free rate plus weighted terms risk premium but you end up with a number that you think is too low you start adding numbers to it appraisers use things like small cap premium what is that you're a small company you must have a higher cost let me add four percent you're in a liquid company I'll add another three percent basically you're pushing up the discount rate to a point where you feel comfortable I don't use any of these Alternatives because to me they're an opening for bias remember we talked about how bias can affect evaluation this is a process where you're making not just subjective judgments judgments that back up your preconceptions so I'm going to stay with the cap and with all of its weaknesses and limits but if you don't like it again remember they're all turtles this is not an approach that rests on you accepting the cap M as the only way of measuring cost of outbreak and if you want to go the accounting route you trust accountants then there are earnings histories you can use them again there's a lot of smoothing out that happens you can use income statement numbers like earnings or you can focus on balance sheet numbers how much debt does a company have high debt companies you consider risky you know and if you if that is what you feel gives you a better estimate of risk go ahead and use it just try to scale it so that you know whether your company's risky or safer in a value line which used to be one of the more widely used investment service kind of fallen out of favor now it's been around since the 60s used to classify stocks into five groups based on risk from one through five not particularly creative but essentially the arguments will put the safer stocks in one the riskiest stocks in five and they had some kind of weighted judgment they made based on earnings and cash flows if that's what works for you classify companies into five groups and put them based on give them cost of equity based on risky or say I'm okay with that as well as long as you risk adjust the discount rate your 80 percent of the weight towards me why would I make beta the battle I want to fight or I said that's the only way to get a cost of equity so the reason I'm I'm spending even this time is for many of you when you do a DCF people who get caught up in this beta thing and I'm just saying let it go it's not the battle that you want to fight so ask them okay what do you want me to use instead as a risk measure bring that in show them the value doesn't change that much and most of the time it will not and kind of move on to the next phase of evaluation so now I'm going to circle back and redeem regression data you know when when you ask people where do betas come from you know people who use betas ever I had one Banker tried to tell me where babies came from I said no no betas I know where babies come from I have four of them and you know what the reactions you ask about where debate has come from they look at you like have two heads what do you mean by debate they come from Bloomberg they come from Bara because let's face it once you start working betas come from Services nobody sits and runs a regression but betas don't come from from Bloomberg Obara they don't even come from regression they come from choices you make as a company so I'm going to dig a little deeper and talk about what is it that causes some companies to be more exposed to Market res which is what a high beta is and some companies to be less exposed and there are three choices there are only three that a company makes that determine what it's beta should be the first is what kind of business are you in think about it betas measure how you move with the market and the economy right so you're in a cyclical business you should have a higher beta than if you're in a non-cyclical business historically cyclical business yet housing and steel and Automobiles and non-cyclical youth food and you know household products and until about 30 years ago this is the only line I used to draw cyclical on this side non-cyclical but the world is getting Messier so I'll give you another distinction that that I think works better the more discretionary your product or service is as a company to your customers the higher your beta will be you know what I mean by discretionary if your customers can live without your product they can delay buying it they can defer buying it you should have a much higher beta than if they cannot do that so I'll give you a sector where you can see this player let's take the retail sector huge sector right lots of different companies I'm going to break these companies into four groups and I want you to rank them in terms of based on what we just said which of these groups should have the highest beta which should have the lowest beta to luxury retailers Gucci's the Tiffany's of the world then you got department stores there are not that many left but there's still a few then you've got discount retailers let's say grocery retailers are also in the mix which of these four groups should have the highest beta yes you can live without those guccis trust me I know you feel you will die if you don't get them but who are you Kim Kardashian luxury retailers are going to have higher betas why because it's going to much be so they're going to do much better in good times and much worse in bad times who should be second on the list probably department stores which should be lowest on the list grocery retailers right you can live without your guccis but I don't think you can live without food you can experiment and see how long you last but it's not going to be that long but to show you even within sectors you can have differences let's take the grocery sector you got Safeway and Kroger and you got Whole Foods and sprouts so if I were looking across these companies which grocery store should have the highest paid and which one should have the lower beta why do you go to Whole Foods because you feel rich you said I have a lot of money I'm willing to pay three times what I should be paying for eggplant because I get organic eggplant you lose your job all of a sudden you say you know what I'm going to die anyway I go to the discount store I get the eggplant that they have in that section you know half used eggplants I'm okay with it you should expect Whole Foods you have a higher beta then a Kroger I wanted to start thinking in those terms because you told me you've already picked the company I'm going to trust you when you said that I want you to think about what your company makes and sells and ask how discretionary it is it'll raise some interesting existential questions for you like can I live without my Netflix I will let you figure that out but those are the issues we haven't tested yet I mean many of these big tech companies have never really been tested right we haven't had a severe recession a long time we're going to find out if there's a recession how discretionary your doordashes and your Netflix's so we're going to get a testing mechanism but think discretionary non-discretionary yep hey what about yeah so let's say you took you have a Ferrari no you don't right you know what about a Maserati no not that either maybe a Rolls me no but you can see the same phenomenon applies right Mass Market automobile companies will have lower betas than luxury the Ferraris and Maseratis are so selective and we'll come back and talk about them they're really not even discretionary they're like an exclusive Club they won't even let you in they definitely won't let me in I live in a part of the world La Jolla where you walk on I walk by five Luxury Auto companies I'm terrified of actually trying to go into one because they might check my credentials so how many billionaires do you know none get out of here right okay so but if you look at it at a dime or BMW they tended to have more volatile sales than a Volkswagen So within the automobile sector you have variations and I would say the same thing about electric cars right this is one of the big challenges that Tesla faces it might dominate the electric car space now but it's still what is the Tesla 3 cost forty five fifty thousand dollars you cannot become a mass Market automobile company even in the US and forget about becoming a mass Market automobile company in India China with that price so one of the challenges for Tesla is going to be how do you bring prices down not just to produce more revenues but to make yourself less discretionary okay it's not so much a wide range a lot of BMWs but they're all expensive right you need if you're from all the way from luxury to mass Market then you're probably safer than one that's just luxury products right so ranges matter if you're appealing to a much broader group and making your products and service less discretion yes the pandemic we all lost our minds I would take 2020 out of every single analysis we do because we were doing weird stuff you know because it might be that we were so attached to our phones in that period in fact I think we got more attached to our phones and our family and friends that no so the pandemic I think is a strange period because we're stuck at home we had nothing to do and God only knows what happens when you do that with you but I think if you look at every you know every historic downturn every crisis the companies that get hit the first are the luxury competition happened in 2008 this if there's a recession in 2023 that's what I would look for it's definitely not going to look like 2020 anymore so that was an aberration I think because of the nature of that crisis so that's the first stop tell me something about your product or service so I want you to think about whatever product or service your company produces a is it discretionary is it not yes they're low risk so you've answered my question right which is can you live without your legal drugs I use the word legal in French okay that's a good question no if you look at at diseases there are multiple treatments for a disease right but the thing is in the U.S patients don't make those choices right it's through a Doctrine an insurance company so pharmacists messed up space because if it's intermediary if you have good insurance you're going to get the right drugs whether your your job is shaky or not so to become the system based on what kind of insurance you have so Pharma companies historically in the US have had low betas because they tend to be things you can't live without and insurance companies seem to pay in good times and bad times that could change maybe if Medicare becomes the leading pair for medicine that could affect you know what whatever but right now at least in the U.S not a particularly discretionary product in fact this discretionary non-discretionary econ classes you had a different name for it right what does that measure elasticity of Demand right every class you ever take at the school is in service of my class only reason that econ class even matters is because it taught you about elasticity of demand and it flexibility so thank God for that class forget the rest of the class take that piece out of the class let's take our second stop tell me something about your cost structure what does that mean remember every company is fixed costs and variable costs the greater the proportion of your costs that are fixed costs it's called operating leverage the higher your beta is going to be intuitively why is that why is having a lot of fixed costs going to increase the beta for your company what do fixed costs do in good time good exactly right if you have mood swings think of having a lot of fixed costs as making you bipolar basically because your moods are going to swing I mean in Good Times you make going to make tons of money in bad times you're going to lose tons of money businesses with a lot of fixed costs will have more valid learnings more variable earnings and I'll give you my favorite example of a business that's in a sense almost defined by its cost structure it's the airline business look at a typical Airline it'll go down its cost but each one tell me whether it's a fixed cost or a variable cost First you've got to lease the aircraft fixed cost of variable costs you can't go to whoever you leave you know what our plates are half full we'll pay you half the lease it doesn't work that way fixed cost pure cost fixed cost of variable cost once you've decided you're going to fly from New York to LA you can't come and count the number of people on the plane say only eight people are let's fill it halfway let's see how far we go there will be eight people left on the plane after you do that I know there's some variation depending on the load but you're gonna burn through the fuel whether to hate people on the so fuel costs mostly fixed costs employee expenses if you're unionizella I've been on flights where I've been outnumbered by the stewardesses doesn't improve the service any but you're outnumbered there are five of them they're only remember I used to fly after 9 11. there'd be three people on the plane five stewardesses didn't make a difference in the service but still a fixed cost so guess what you get for Airlines Feast of family notice the airlines never have a normal year they're either making billions or going bankrupt I've never seen Airlines ever have well this is a normal year for an airline it's essentially this is a great year or we're going bankrupt so the more operating leverage you have the higher fixed costs the higher your beta which brings me a third and final stop well it's a function of the oil price right so there your cost structure stays the same so oil companies last year and astoundingly good year in terms of earnings oil companies in 2020 at an astoundingly bad year because it's not the just the infrastructure because operating the oil Drakes and getting oil out of the ground it's an expensive process and I think that car stays fixed whether you're taking out you know three barrels or 300 barrels so with oil companies again you get those wild swings and profits I thought you were going to ask me what about in even with the airline business when you have an outlier you know the uh who the outlier the airline business right the company that's been written about in more cases than any other company in history anybody want to guess what that company is Southwest let's think of what Southwest does that's different from a typical Airline first it leases its aircraft but for the longest time every single Southwest aircraft was a Boeing 737. you know why they did that because it meant that they could keep one maintenance crew on every and didn't have to because every aircraft is unique enough that he got to bring in you know different maintenance Crews fuel costs I hope they don't economize because I do Fly Southwest sometimes I don't want to be 20 miles from my destiny say sorry guys we're running out of fuel okay that's not a great outcome they are a unionized airline but the airline with the most flexible Workforce I've seen Stewart is have you ever been on United where the stewardess alert checked you in never I mean you could be surrounded by them the podium could be falling apart I can't do that I've been working here 27 years never checked anybody in before I'm not going to start with you Southwest you know so you actually get an adaptable Workforce but for the longest time Southwest created a template for the airline business that kept their cost law I remember the first time I flew Southwest out of the New York area and I'm using that word deliberately did I make this reservation to fly from Southwest from New York to L.A got a cheap flight very happy day of the flight comes about and I'm glad I checked in time because I'm checking which airport am I flying out about it's not newer it's not JFK it's not LaGuardia said I slip if you're from Islip I don't mean to insult you but I had no idea where I slip watch it turns out to be the small town in Long Island that they flew out of I've managed to get a cab to that town cursing Southwest all the time get on the plane say thank God I'm going into la I land in L.A come out and there's this gigantic statue of John Wayne in the middle I said this isn't L.A it turns out to be Orange County airport and they did this in city after city right you fly out of one and why did they do that what is the benefit of doing that how do you get to fly out of New York I mean have you ever been to Terminal C in New York it's a con it's a United terminal used to be the Continental terminal it's like 200 Gates and they do things like fly you into gate seven and give you a connecting flight and plate 153. I think they do it just for laughs I think there's some guy upstairs with a with a camera on you say look she's never going to make it let's switch the signs on her okay it's like a hundred gates in there and how do you think United keeps those Gates it pays airports for those Gates they're expensive it's a fixed cost and for the longest time Southwest said we're not paying that fixed cost you fly into Chicago you still flying to Midway not O'Hare on Southwest and this is a pattern that other discount Airlines have copied elsewhere if you go to Europe please don't fly a discount Airline you think you might be flying into Paris but you're flying into the rough vicinity of Paris it might be a hundred miles away and you get out and say how do I get there and say just start walking maybe three days from now you'll get there but the higher fixed costs the higher rate and Southwest deliberately created a model to keep fixed cost at you know how this manifested itself the month after 9 11 Southwest had a higher market cap than all of the other airlines put together it's the only airline that showed any chance of surviving that downturn because it is the most flexible cost structure or another example Hospitality business hotels are bound down by a lot of fixed costs the one big Advantage Airbnb has over a Hyatt or a Marriott is they have a cost structure that's completely flexible they don't own that so during during the 2020 when people are doing crazy things that was a perfect time for Airbnb to go public because their advantage over the rest of the business was greatest second stop so what business are you in how much fixed cost you have 35 yes go ahead okay yes the people would do it for their assistive control first there are two things in a farm right one is where they can predict how much your crops will be right and that's in much of the world that that part is the the variance in that is low so what's driving the variants it's what the price of corn is what the price of in the U.S you know how farmers stay in business is because the U.S government steps in and provides price guarantees they have to otherwise Farmers would just go out of business if fixed costs are so large you would not make it through downturns so agriculture around the world that's a big factor is the more commodity prices swing the more difficult it becomes for a farm to continue because of huge amount of fixed cost that cost is not going to go go away whether you have low prices or high prices so it's a question that's around what people have to ask a a factory farm run by a corporation is a better shot because they can diversify right they can own Farmland in or in Iowa they can own Farmland in Australia and things can average out but an individual farmer is completely exposed which is why there are fewer and fewer of them left around the world which brings me a third and final question so what business are you in what fixed costs do you have how much have you borrowed you see why this question is relevant if you own equity in a company when you borrow money you create a fixed cost you did not have until you borrowed the money what am I talking about what's a fixed cost that arises the minute you borrow money interest expenses you got to make it in Good Times not a problem but you also unfortunately Banker seems to insist you make it in bad times as well right it makes your Equity earnings more volatile you can take a safe business and end up with risky Equity if you borrow enough money so here's what I'm going to do to bypass regression Pages I'm going to take what I've learned about the drivers of betas and say rather than trust one single slice of history and one regression I'm going to build up to a beta by looking at what business it's in what its operating leverage looks like and maybe how much it's poor so let's start with the with the first step we're going to start with the bait of the business if you're in the steel business you don't invent this business it's been a business that's been around there are other companies in the business I'm going to look at risk at other companies the business to get a sense of how risky is this business now if you happen to be a business like any other steel business I'll assume your fixed cost and variable costs look very much like any other but if you're like a Southwest you've got this new way of doing business then I've got to factor in the difference in operating leverage that you're a steel company with much more flexible costs finally I'm going to say how much have you borrowed and I'm going to try to bring that into your bed sounds like a lot of task so let's start with the first of those tasks am I missing a page okay so let's talk about the second step in the process adjusting for operating leverage did I skip a page was it an 87 I've been losing Pages as I go through okay so we're okay okay we're 87 is the page that I'm okay we're okay there okay so let's talk about how to adjust for operating leverage you understand the logic High fixed cost should have higher betas there's actually a mechanism for adjusting for leverage that we know how to use so if you tell me what the fixed variable costs are of every company in a sector I can tell you how much lower Southwest beta has to be than other airlines but what did I say you have to know how much fixed and variable costs are in every company I challenge you to pick up an income statement for any company and break costs down into fixed and variable because accountants don't break costs into fixing variable right there's cost of goods sold is it you can try to guess it's a sgna probably fixed r d I have no idea the problem is not with adjusting for operating leverage it's getting the information I'm preemptively going to make a confession which is when I look at companies in a sector I'm going to assume that they all have the same operating leverage not because I want to but because the information to differentiate across the companies is just not there question I'm sorry it's calculated through a bunch of different regressions you're actually good so in fact I'm going to get to that point how is this a solution the regression beta problem because if you get an industry beta what did I do I took a hundred regressions and I averaged the beta I've already given you one of the clues as to why an industry beta is better than a single regression beta but but I'll come and back it up because that's a very good question how is this getting us out of the regression beta problem because you know getting those those betas for individual companies you still need it so adjusting for operating leverage I know how to do it but I just don't have the raw data but on financial leverage there is a way I can adjust betas and the data is there when you borrow a lot of money you know where it's going to show up it has a high debt to equity ratio and I'm talking entirely in market value terms so you more you borrow the higher the debt to equity is going to be when you run a regression you get a beta you get what's called a levered beta what does that mean the beta reflects not just the business you're in but how much debt you took on so if you could tell me how much debt you have as a company I can tell you how much higher your beta should be given that day so the equation that gets used it's called the Hamada equation it's been around 50 years it's to basically start with the beta of the business units the unleavid is the bait of the business you're in and then bring in the effect of debt through your debt to equitation and the higher debt equity ratio the higher your levit beta listen what's at 1 minus t doing in there why is there a one minus t in that equation debt is a fixed cost but the government stands by your side say you know what I'll give you a little benefit here you have 500 million in fixed in in interest expenses you get a tax savings of 25 you're really paying only 375 million that equation is built on the premise that all of the risk in a company is born by its Equity investors that lenders are there to get a contractual claim that there are that that's not a bad assumption until you get to really risky companies you know why right if you led to a really risky company your debt is going to start to behave like equity your claimants are being a contractual claim will start to look like a residual claim you get whatever's left over because you don't want to push them into bankruptcy so there will be cases where people say well you're making a strong assumption here you're assuming the beta of debt is zero and my response is okay so tell me what the bait of debt is because there's a version of this equation which is almost never used where if you know the bait of debt you can adjust the bait of equity for the fact that sometimes that that carries some of the risk of the business so let's review so to get around regression betas I'm going to start with a business beta adjust for operating leverage if I have dated fixed variable costs and then adjust for financial leverage using the simple equation and if you really push me the more complex equation either way I'm ending up with the beta that reflects the business you're in your operating leverage in your financial leverage so here's my way of estimating beta so this is the only way I've estimated weight is the 30 years I've never I haven't used a regression-bated value company in a really really long time I compute what's called a bottom-up beta and to illustrate the process I'm going to let you be my guinea pig so you started a business you started company it's in two businesses pick any two what two businesses would you like to be in so you want to be in healthcare you want to run hospitals you want to no okay so you're in healthcare so what's the other business okay so you want to be in healthcare and hotels and you say look you want to know your beta I'll be back tomorrow here's what I do I go back to my office I find as many publicly traded health care companies as I can and the reason I pushed you on what aspect of healthcare is if it's hospital I look for Hospital companies if it's emergency clinics I look for Clinic companies I find a hundred companies publicly traded that are in that business I find a hundred publicly traded Hotel companies and if they're publicly what can I look up at each of them a regression paid on each of them I take the average regression beta for the 100 healthcare companies and the average regression beta for the 100 Hotel companies have an average beta for each business remember that beta I said is reflects the business therein as well as the debt they've taken on so I'm going to look at the debt to equity ratio for healthcare companies and the debt to equity ratio for hotel companies I'm still staying with a comparable list and I'm going to take out the effect of debt sounds fancy but it's called unlevering a beta I'm taking out the effective debt from the regression rate I'm almost there I now have an unlevered beta being in hotels and Healthcare they come back to you okay you told me you're in two businesses how much value do you get in each business your reaction might be I have no idea but I got 70 my revenues last year from from Healthcare and 30 from hotels help me out now what do I do next I take a weighted average 0.7 times the healthcare beta plus 0.3 times a hospital beta I now have an unlevered beta for your company can I ask you a final question do you have any debt what I'm hoping for is your answers I have no debt in which case I'm done right but if you tell me your debt I compute your debt to equity ratio and level your back paid up to reflect your Leverage it's called a bottom-up beta and now let me get back to the question how is this saving me from the regression beta Cuts instead of one regression beta all I've done is used an average of a hundred right what is one of the issues I had with regression betas big standard error right so let's say I have a hundred betas all of which have high standard errors and I average those 100 betas up what is the standard error of the average going to look like in this case help me out she picked 100 if I picked 100 I made your life easy right it's going to be one tenth the standard error of any degree 110 because square root of 100 if I have a hundred companies in my sample I've now creativated that's 10 times more precise than any individual regression so my first reason for using bottom up 8 is is I got more precise betas here's my second what is the other problem I had with regression betas it reflected your company as it used to be you told me you're in two businesses let me fill in the details let's suppose you entered the hospital the healthcare business yesterday you did it because you did an acquisition until then you were just a hotel company if I run a regression on your company's stock price I'm going to get the wrong regression beta even if the regression bait is right because I'm going to get a beta for you being in the hotel business but if I do bottom-up pages I get to set the weights in fact I can ask you what are your plans for next year maybe you want to start a software company you know what I'm going to do I'm going to take a weighted average reflecting how much software is going to be of your business tomorrow not only do I get a more precise beta I get a beta that reflects the business mix you are in and that you plan to be in here's my final bonus if I have to Value Porsche to racially in public man there's no regression made it right it's not even a choice it's not listed I can now estimate the beta for a company that's not listed because I don't need past prices I just need to know what business you're in how much debt you have a bottom-up beta is not a Panacea but it removes many of the issues you have you still have to deal with the Diversified investor part if you don't like that but it makes my life so much easier because when I sit down to Value company I'm not running 15 regressions on Blue Book I'm looking at what business is here and I'm coming up at the bottom of beta and then I'm moving on to the cash flows yes Quest how would you play around with an average of 100 numbers to require a lot of playing around right can you pick a sample that gives you if you but remember what I said up Fred if you have strong enough bias you're going to find a way through any system but here's what I would suggest you do if you know people do that near the other side of the table and they show you a list of 27 companies as the companies they use to get the beta you know what the question you need to ask them is right did you start with 27 they would lie and say yes but the truth is they probably start with 60 and started shedding high band is low betas but you know what the bias is that strong no approach used is going to be mute from it but at least you'll be less effective you know what will make you what will make you suspicions hi is if you have an infrastructure company with a bait of 0.3 at the average is 1.1 you can see the average yourself you don't have to have this guy tell you the beta for ports businesses or airports businesses you know if you go to my website and click on data and I've been doing this for now 25 years you can get the beta by Industry Group for every publicly traded company in the world I give you Global averages U.S averages and it's built into every one of my Excel spreadsheets that I do for valuation and I do it because it gives me perspective it tells me when I'm using a number that's unusual for a sector it forces me to explain why okay so you're right people will play games so you don't have to let them play games you can compute the average yourself you have Capital IQ if you open style create it started your access to Capital IQ yet no right do it now okay that is the advantage of capital IQs you can pull up every steel company in 15 minutes you can give me the beta for sale companies you don't have to let other people drive the agenda because it's easy to push back so my argument for bottom of betas is they're less noisy smaller standard errors they're updated they reflect the businesses you're in and the businesses you could be in and I can use them for private businesses divisions of companies I now have a toolbox that I can use to do valuation a much wider array of cases so let me give you a few examples of bottom-up beta calculations the first is a beta calculation I did and this is I do use this clear company in my corporate finance class company called violates a mining company It's Brazil based it's PR it's one of the law it's the largest ironr Mining Company in the world but it also is in a bunch of other businesses other metals fertilizers Logistics so I valued Vale a few years ago and I wanted to get a beta for the company I took its businesses I looked up publicly traded companies and I used Global samples because these are businesses where it competes against companies elsewhere in the globe for the same Market do I get the law of large numbers working for me God do I have a lot of large numbers working look at the fertilizer business I have 693 companies I didn't prove the sample why would I prune the sample and that's actually suspicions when people start pruning samples you could ask what's your end game so if you have a good reason and say I want to look at small fertilizer companies because they're riskier than large companies I'm willing to listen but he said I took all the companies whose name style you know started with c and d I'm not willing to listen because that seems awfully arbitrary they are the unleaviders for those businesses so that's what I report on my website so this is the Time Saver once you've estimated them at the start of the year I'm not redoing it every time I do evaluation and the beta football is a weighted average of the betas of the different businesses they're in that's a question I asked them but wait no if you're in a hurry you can use revenues to weight the businesses but the promise revenues is that not don't always go with value if you're a high margin business you'll get a higher value for the same Dollar in revenues than if you're in a low margin business so here's my quick and dirty way of converting revenues to that remember all those publicly traded companies have pulled up to get my betas I also have the market values of these companies called Enterprise Value that's a Market's judgment on what these companies are worth I can look at what multiple of revenues publicly traded companies trade at in this space so typical metals and Mining Company trades at 1.97 times Revolution I take bali's revenues from matters and Mining multiply by 1.97 I get an estimated value for each of the businesses that's what becomes the basis to my waste and based on my looking at Violet this looks like a company about 77 percent iron ore mining 16 metals and five five percent fertilizers and one point seven six percent Logistics the Only Rule you cannot violate is you better make sure your weights add up to 100 percent because otherwise all kinds of bad stuff can happen to you no matter what weighting mechanism you use I'm okay with it as long as the weights at up to 100 yes I'd be very careful about pruning out loud should everybody get a question let's say you're you know you sit in front of a Bloomberg terminal or S P CAP like you you put up 50 companies you notice one company has a bait of 3.3 he said I'm going to take that out it looks High you know the danger of that is if you want to take that out I'm going to ask you to look at a beta point two because you want to take it then you take out the 3.3 and 2 point and point two you know what's going to be the outlier the 2.2 this is not a game I want to play the larger your sample the less you care about outliers so go for bigger samples that's the advantage because it's small samples outliers can be a factor and there's a simple fix for outliers right instead of using the average what should you use instead just use the median it's a much simpler fix you won't have to worry about outliers yeah but essentially what you're doing is replacing a single slice of History one company with this average across companies so my beta for for Valley across the businesses you take the weighted average is 0.84 I use the debt to equity ratio for Vale to come up with the leopard betas not just for the company but for each individual business why do you think I want betas and cost of equity for individual businesses one is if I want to Value each business separately the second is in this case Wale actually was thinking about selling its Logistics business and if they called you and said hey value the logistics business I want a beta and a cost of equity for the logistics business so when you're in multiple businesses this is a way in which you can get a beta for the company and it's it's good work because it'll make you understand what what does my company do where does its value come from now there's a there's a there are a couple of mechanical questions I want to kind of address here in terms of doing this because you know this is something I've described long time people do it you know sometimes they run into at least this issue now this was actually a beta that I was Computing for embryer Brazilian Aerospace company so initially I said I want to find publicly traded companies like embryo and you've got s p Capital IQ you can actually constrain your search you can say find me all aerospace companies and initially I said find me all aerospace companies in Brazil and I ran into a bit of a prop you know the promise only one company showed up it was called embryer this is not helping me I'm replacing Empire I said find me all aerospace companies in Latin America came back with one company called embryer and then asked why am I staying geographically frozen embryo makes aircraft that it sells in Europe it sells in Europe U.S it competes not against other Latin American it competes against Bombardier it competes against you know even even the smaller Jets at Boeing producers I said it's a global Aerospace company increasingly when I value companies I go to my Global averages I get two benefits one is and always find lots of companies so the law of large numbers requires large numbers that's useful but the case of embroidery gave me a way of getting betas which was so when somebody says I can't find enough companies first question to ask them is how are you defining companies and often you'd see you know Peruvian analysts I'm looking just at Peruvian companies of course you're not going to find enough companies same thing the Portuguese Market right small Market just expand your search so when you think about hey my sample's too small and that's why I want you to get access to S P CAP like you because you can play with that screen to see how it changes as you put in additional screens take screens away okay so to the question of can I use the unleavened beta for U.S and European companies to look at it I don't see why not and here's why what's the average beta across all U.S companies it's part one it's about one because it's a weighted average what's the average weight across all Brazilian companies it's about one beta is not supposed to carry any risk measures the reason I say that is I've seen analysts that say I'm going to use a higher beta for Brazilian companies because Brazilian companies are riskier not the right place if you're worried about risk with Brazilian companies what's the number you should be adjusting the equity risk premium betas were not meant to carry the risk in a company they're going to be scaled around one so don't worry about using developed Market company betas to look at Emerging Market companies or Emerging Market companies look at development because bait is scared I mean the best way to think about is you have 10 rooms of students and within each one you get the weights of every student you can't compare the weights across the rooms if some rooms are filled with obese students and others are the undernourished students right but what if I took the weight of every student and divided by the average weight of the students in the room that's what a beta does it gives you a relative measure of risk so a beta 1.2 in a risky Market is much more worrisome than a beta 1.2 in a safe Market because I'm going to multiply by a much larger Equity risk premium here's the other one you know if you work in Latin America and Europe and even parts of Asia people prefer to use what I call Net debt ratios rather than gross debt ratios let me back up when you think about a debt ratio I said debt to Capital you take total debt outstanding divided by Equity plus debt that's a gross debt ratio in a net debt ratio what you do is you take the debt and you subtract out cash that's what net debt is and use that net debt number which would be a smaller number than gross that to compute things like debt ratios sounds like it should be consequential right if you take a Breyer for instance their gross debt ratio is 19. take total debt and if I use that gross debt ratio the beta that I get for embryo starting with the Aerospace company beta is 1.07 the net debt Ray Sugar is minus 3.32 percent you know when you get Negative net debt ratios what has to be true just look at the equation a little bit if cash exceeds debt you're going to have a negative net debt treasure apple has a negative net debt ratio in fact all the tech companies have negative net debt ratios if I use a negative net debt ratio I'm going to end up with the unleavened beta you know this I'm sorry 11 beta that is actually lower than my unleavened beta it's weird using from bringing that in but net debt ratios can be negative Now by itself you're saying this is going to make a big difference to my cost of equity you're right your cost of equity with net debt ratios will be lower than your cost of equity gross debt ratios but remind me again what the rest of the process requires I have to take that cost of equity put it into a cost to Capital calculation right so cost of equity gets multiplied by the weight of equity your cost of debt gets weighted by the amount of debt you have you use gross debt ratios for a prior you're going to have a higher cost of equity but when you do your cost of capital you're going to get this weighting down effect because 15 of your company comes from debt and the cost of debt is much lower you're gonna end up with a lower cost of capital if you use a net debt ratio let's play it out you're going to end up with a lower cost of equity but when you do your cost of capital you know the weights for equity and debt are going to look like with a negative net debt ratio you're going to end up with 102 equity and minus two percent debt you're not going to get the benefit of cost of dead weighing you're done you're going to end up with if you don't believe me try it out the cost to Capital you're going to end up with for a briar it's going to be roughly the same whether you use gross or net debt ratios which means pick one just stick with it consistently don't go back and forth I prefer gross debt ratios when I do no limit betas and keep cash as a separate acid but if you prefer to net them out many or as I said many European Latin American analysts do I'm okay with that as long as you do that all through the analysis so let's summarize where we are if I asked you for a cost of equity three ingredients right what risk free to introduce let me out here so I'm going to ask you what was created if you're doing an analysis in US dollars so first thing is it depends on your currency your screen rate and in some currencies it's going to be more work than others and ask what Equity risk premium am I going to use what's your answer going to be they could what Equity risk premium should you use for a company for the U.S or for where the company operates you have to take a weighted average of where it operates or your risk-free rate reflects your currency Choice your Equity risk premium reflects where in the world you operate and what is your beta capture what kind of business you're in how risky it is everything has its place in your cost of equity don't mix and match don't bring in country risk into your beta and you're risk reading that's why it took out the default spread from the Government Bond it should prevent the double Counting so risk-free rate bait is equity risk premiums lots of moving pieces there but go back and review the last 60 70 pages of notes because they were leading up to this page of here's how we come up with riskery rates here's how we think about Equity risk premiums and this is how we get paid any questions on costs of equity the best way for this to stick is do this for your company otherwise isn't it I kind of get it you know what if you kind of get it you don't get it man this is to get it it's got to stick you got to do it for your company and that's why I keep nagging you pick a company do this because until you do it and get your hands dirty it's really not going to stick so that's your cost of equity right so what you pay what you're costing out the equity portion that's complete the other half the picture there's another way you could raise Capital which is you can go and borrow money so I want to deal with the question what's your cost of debt and I'm going to lay out the principle that's going to govern how I think about the cost of debt the cost of debt for a company is the rate at which it can borrow money long term today let me repeat that again the cost of debt for companies the rate at which it can borrow money long term today two key words there long term and today let me take the first one long term companies can borrow a short term or they can borrow long term right most of the time which one will look cheaper tomorrow short term or long term most of the time borrowing short term is cheaper because the term structure is usually are put stroke that's not true this year but in most years got an upward sloping term structure so if you let CFOs pick tenor for their debt and you told them look we're going to attach a cost to debt based on the maturity of what you borrow you know what you're going to they're going to do right they're going to take all the debt make it short term and tell you that debt got cheaper so I'm gonna avoid that I'm going to say look tell me how much debt you have I'm going to attach a long-term cost today bring you to the process I mean if you look at a company's existing debt some of it was borrowed in 2022 some in 2021 and if you look at the interest rate on the debt what are you going to see lower numbers than you have today or higher numbers it's free rates for much lower risk premium so much slower the 2021 debt in the 2022 debt is going to look like it's much cheaper than today I'm not going to let you use that as your cost of debt even though you already have it on your books I'm going to recalculate the cost of debt as if you are borrowing money today which means I'm going to start with today's risk reading which is three and a half percent not the one and a half percent you saw a year ago an ad on top of that a default spread so cost of that is a rate at which you can borrow money long term today how do I get that if you have a company that has bonds outstanding they're traded it looks like you have an easy it's like a slam dunk you're saying I know what the cost of debt is all I have to do is look at the yield to mature in the bond that should be a rate at which you can borrow money today and that's technically true but here's why you should be cautious can a risky company issue a safe Bond no you don't think so when you are bondholder what do you look for to decide how safe it is you look to see what secures it right that General obligation but you also look at the assets behind the cash flow so if I have a risky company but there's one very safe let's say there's a government contract otherwise it's guaranteed earnings and cash flows and issues a bond backed up by its safest segments you're going to get a much lower interest rate in the bond than you're going to get in the company this is why Moody's and s p in addition to rating companies also rate individual bonds you can have a single aerated company issuing a double a rated Bond and a triple B rated Bond at the same time because it depends on what's backing up those bonds so if you decide to go with a bond be careful that it's not a bond that's an outlier that it does but I'll give you an easier way if you have bonds outstanding you also have something else observable outstanding you can use to estimate your cost to debt which is a rating is it do companies have to have a rating to issue bonds is it a requirement no you can actually issue bonds without a rating nobody does that you know why because if you decide not to go for a rating and you decide to issue a bond what's the signal you're sending to markets I don't want the ratings to look at my numbers and you then but so almost every company that has bonds outstanding in fact many that don't have bonds out selling still are rated because they don't preemptively just in case you see how this helps you and me when we do evaluation right so when I ask you how risky is a company from a debt perspective you have two choices you can do all the Dirty Work yourself of computing all the default risk measures and the ratios or you can trust Moody's be honest with me which of those two Pathways looks more attractive to you at the moment I'll be honest every single time I get to the session the last thing I want to be doing is being a fixed income guy projecting you know earnings for the next 50 years and figure out how to default risk I know Moody's is not the sharpest knife in the drawer but you know what it's there it's free and save me so much time could that get you to trouble sometimes absolutely if you have a rating for your company you can use it to come up with a default spread and once you get a defaults credit card it cost to debt so when you think about cost of debt if you have a rating your life got simple you use the rating to come up with a default spread an increasingly large percentage of companies have Bond ratings it used to be at one point in time that U.S companies have Bond ratings but outside the US companies did not because even in Europe companies used to borrow from Banks so but as you know as recently as 25 years ago now of course Bond markets have developed in Europe they've developed in Asia you have ratings for about 30 maybe 35 of global companies but that still still leaves you with 65 of companies primarily in Emerging Markets in parts of Europe where you don't have a rating for a company oh my God what do I do now I don't have the crutch I usually use I'm going to give you a very simplistic way of coming up with default spreads for these companies for a brief moment in time I want you to be act like a ratings agency you're going to be Moody's for five minutes but you have only five minutes to do this Moody's claims to use eight financial ratios to come up with rating in fact for the longest time we went to the Moody's website they would list out or the S P website they'd list out the eight ratios Avid data fixed charges ebit to interest expenses debt to Capital and so we use these eight ratios and one thing I've learned by looking at these Services is they like to throw a lot of noise into their measurement mechanisms so I said okay maybe use these eight ratios but I'm going to try to reverse engineer what you really look at to come up with theoretics I downloaded the ratings for every rated company and the eight ratios they claim to look at and then I did a little sorting I sort into Triple A Double A what I was trying to figure out is hey can I reverse engineer how they came up with these ratings by looking at the ratios and here's what I saw with non-financial service companies Banks and insurance companies a different game altogether non-financial service companies one of those eight ratios seem to be carrying the bulk of the weight and the other seven were along for the ride so this is a purely empirical statement I'm not saying this is a good ratio but the ratio that best explains differences in ratings across non-financial service companies is called an interest coverage range it's a very simple ratio you take the operating income earnings before interest and taxes and you divide by interest expense so the higher this ratio the safer you feel as a lender right you got more buffer so this ratio is seven you've got seven dollars of income for every dollar in interest expenses you feel much safer than if this ratio is three now for embryer in 2004 that ratio is 3.56 I'd use an average across time because the income is all over the place you know what that number was for adani last week before the Hindenburg group 1.42 right and it's not unusual infrastructure companies and does it mean they're going to go bankrupt not necessarily but you don't have a whole lot of buffer right because your income operating income drops by 30 to 35 you're already below the interest expense which means you've got to come up with the money somewhere you don't have to default but it's I can compute the interest coverage ratio for every company I don't need a rating I don't need a ratings agency this is operating from the web address expense if you can compute an interest coverage ratio for your company I can guess what the rating for your company is remember I said I started by looking at ratings agencies and reverse engineering what they did one of the things I did as part of the reverse engineering is I built a lookup table around the interest coverage in order to lookup table is you tell me what the interest coverage ratio is based on how ratings agencies attach ratings I'll tell you what a rating will look like for your company my interest coverage ratio table in 2004 and the 2023 version is on my website if you if you're a large company so there are two sets of numbers here one for large and one for small because life isn't fair if you're a small company you need a much higher interest conversation to get the same rating so if you're a large company with an interest coverage ratio of 5.75 your rating is going to be a plus if you're a small company that interest coverage ratio of 3.60 your rating is going to be double b plus so you see what I'm going to do if you don't have a rating I'm going to take your interest coverage ratio I'm going to look up the rating that goes with that interest coverage ratio and once I do that then I can get a default spread and a cost of debt so the 65 percent of companies that if the company is the rating don't go looking for trouble you don't need a synthetic rating trust Moody's to have looked at more than just the interest coverage rate but if you don't this is a quick and dirty way of coming up with the rating and a cost to 10. in the case of embryo for instance with the 3.56 interest coverage ratio the rating I gave them was a minus the purely synthetic rating based on so 3.56 let's see where that is now there it is 3.56 and a minus rating a minus rating gives you a default spread of one percent but there's one final piece of this puzzle that's a little messy that one percent default spread is what I would charge as a default spread for the company but embryer is a Brazilian company this is another one of life's big unfair you know unfair blows if you're in Emerging Market company you carry two burdens on your shoulder one is your burden in terms of company risk so there's a default spread but you think the fact that you're a Brazilian company or a Greek company might affect your cost of debt as well yeah that's why I said life's not fair you're a Greek company you walk in you tell the bank I'm a great company the bank says 30 interest rates I haven't shown you my financials I'm really strong 29 Maybe pack for the longest time ratings agencies in the U.S used to have a sovereign ceiling on your rating that no company in the country could exceed the rating of the country you were in and imagine that poor Venezuelan company that's struggling right now because they're rating a c or stuck at sea ratings agencies have removed the explicit ceiling but implicitly it's still there when you look at how they rate Emerging Market companies for the same numbers you will get a low rating and this isn't a conspiracy they're doing it because this is an extra burden of country risk in your analysis so the long story here is my cost of debt for Empire starts with the risk credit I was doing it in US Dollars adds a one percent default spread for Embry but also brings in a portion of the country default spread why only a portion because embryo gets 70 of its revenues outside or 97 outside Brazil I would expect to be less exposed to default risk than a company that gets all of its revenues in Brazil it's like a Lambda playing out here but when you do costs of debt for emerging market companies there could be two default spreads one for the company and one for the country so that's the cost of debt I will leave you with one final question the rate the table that I developed came from looking at all rated companies and when I first did it was a U.S table because as early in us but I used to use it all over the world and as long as you didn't have interest rates which are very different from U.S interest rates I felt comfortable if your interest rates are much higher it gets messaged so when you start on Wednesday we'll talk about how do you adjust synthetic rating for the fact that you might have twenty percent rates or 30 rates because things do get trickier for a large country 
thank you foreign first is there's no class next Monday it's a great it's a celebration of President's Day I'm not even sure what how exactly you celebrate presidents here but I guess guess we go shopping big shopping day do whatever you need to do but it's a long weekend and because it's a long weekend I've decided to go home to me is California which means I leave tomorrow morning and I don't want to come back on Tuesday for just one class so next Wednesday's class is going to be a zoom class okay you guys like Zoom classes I guess but somebody in the last class said should I still come to the classroom to watch a zoom class my reaction is are you out of your mind it's a zoom class do it in your pajamas at home if you need to but I will send you the link the Link's out there already but I would send it to you the class will be a zoom class and it'll be interesting because I know 350 people which meets five you know the number of maximum number of people you can see on a gallery page in Zoom 48. the reason I know it intimately is because I taught this class entirely online one semester and you keep flipping Gallery page to Gallery page but it'll be a zoom class the second is I want to ask you whether you picked a company already because I will assume from this point on that you picked a company and you just forgotten to enter the name into the master list I will let it slip for the moment but I will keep an eye and at some point I will email you saying I notice you have no company next to your name you remember the email addresses are there as well please so don't make me do that and to the neck the third is I know some of you are feeling a little overwhelmed because I do drown you and stuff right every day there's something coming at you and you've got to give it up you're saying I'm not even reading this guy's emails and the reason the reason I say that is yesterday I got an email from somebody who shall remain unnamed saying I'm in your class I've been reading your emails is that enough for the class can I just read your emails and will I keep up with the class I wish my emails were that productive and but I understand you have a life to live you have other classes to take I don't know why you take all those other classes but you have other classes take I think you need the credits not particularly for the learning but you take the classes anyway which means that you know I'd love for all of you to be obsessed with this class make it your whole life but that's not healthy for you it's not healthy for me so I understand you have time constraints so one of the things I'm going to send you in the email today is a list of what you should be doing depending on your time constraints so I'm going to break it down into have a really full life you're just intruding on my life I want to spend as little time as I can less than three hours on top of the lectures right so in less than three hours including the lectures means you really are not spending any time outside I'll list out the four things you should do you should do the post-class tests every session it's about 10 minutes you should review the lecture notes which will take you about 30 minutes no and you should prepare for the quiz at least every three weeks or so you should be spending you know maybe at least take four quizzes and then I go three to six hours six to ten and if you're really obsessed with the class and you're willing to say who needs sleep I have 15 weeks I can spend every moment on valuation I give you a full list of things to do as well so be realistic about what your constraints are if you feel you have limited time spend it in the places where it makes the biggest difference which means you're not doing a valuation of the week each week right because if you have only three hours I want you to focus on getting the stuff that you absolutely need to do I think you're missing something with evaluation of the week you know I think so otherwise why would I waste you know spend the time coming up with it but I think there's a difference between what you want to get out of this class in terms of a grade and what you want to get out of lunch you can get a perfectly good grade without ever doing a valuation to me no you know yesterday I put up a ramco right right you don't value ramco it's not like you can't do valuation you can't answer the problems on the quiz I do think it's good for learning because you learn you when you value a ramco what do you value you're valuing Saudi Arabia right why because 80 percent of Saudi Arabia's GDP comes from oil and a ramco is the receptacle for that order you're not just failing Saudi Arabia you're making a bet on the house of South right whether you like it or not this is a joint bet on a country and a ruling family because if any of those pieces breaks your investment is going to break as well so vices takes over Saudi Arabia tomorrow God help your aramco investment God help the rest of us on everything else but you see basically I want to do the aramco valuation to illustrate there are some companies with a big question to face are not about the company they're about country and politics how do I bring that into the analysis so read that email make your judgment on how much time you're willing to spend then focus on the line items I suggest you should focus on given your time constraint and if you have more time of course you can spill over into the other list but don't end up spending your time in the wrong places and then find yourself unable to do the basic mechanics of the class because that would be epitome so with that long leading let's talk about cash flows and earnings today we're going to leave discount trades behind and I'm glad we will be because in this kind of cash flow evaluation I think I said this early on we focus too much on discount trades and too little on cash flows So today we're going to we're going to start the cash flow calculation and you're going to notice that I start with a number that I get from a group that I've kind of besmirched their reputations all the way through which is a concrete I've said some terrible things about accountants I'm not going to take any of it back but the truth of the matter is we are dependent on accountants feeding us a number that gets our cash flow calculations gone right all cash flow calculations start with an accounting earnings number net income operating income and remember you are valuing your company as of right now so please don't turn in valuations as of January 1st 2023 it doesn't help me in the least telling me that you'd have bought a stock on January 1st 2023 is completely useless you can't go back in time and do it so you're going to be valuing company on March 7 you know April 15 however late you want to put this off but you're going to Value it as of that day so what if you're buying a company in April 15th of 2023 you want your numbers to reflect what things look like on April 15th of 2023 some of the numbers are going to get updated right like what your t-bond rate you should be using a t-bond rate from the start of 2023 on April 15th there will be a d bond rate maybe even implied Equity risk premium because I'll update it in April 1st you can use the updated premium so the market based numbers are going to automatically update but you also need accounting numbers right accounting numbers don't update every second of every day every minute or even every day they update every time accountants come out with a new financial statement the U.S that's once every quarter so you want updated accounting numbers the only problem is those numbers don't and if you're stuck with annual reports they update once a year so given that we want updated earnings numbers I'm going to ask you how to compute those updated numbers and I'm going to give you four choices to come up with updated earnings for your company so let's say you're doing evaluation right now February whatever 2015 16 17th 18th 19th yeah you could take the last 10K if any of you check to see what your last 10K is for your company what is the last 10K which which year you got 2022 already Tesla has it but for most of the companies I've checked so far the last 10K I found was 2021. many companies haven't come out with their fourth quarter yet so you're stuck with 2021 numbers if it's 2022 you're home free because that's the most updated number so Tesla you got lucky but aramco was September 30th 2022. you can go with the last 10K and say what choice do I have but the last 10K for you might be 20 21 10 game you can multiply the last quarter's earnings by four you think that's a good idea technically it makes a quarter into a year what's the problem multiplying the last quarter's earnings by four or seasonality right so basically their seasonality and your retail firm and you take the last the third quarter and multiply by four I will not get a number close to my annual number so don't do that I can add together the earnings over the last four quarters what's that called it's called LTM last 12 months or trailing 12 months basically it's obtained by which means for many of your companies you're looking at October 1st of 2021 through September 30th of 2022. it's called trailing forward now part of this thing but my 10ks of April 15 2023 my you are being consistent you know how you're being consistent you're using the most updated numbers you can for every single input in the case of accounting unfortunately that input is going to be a lagged input and if you really even that makes you uncomfortable then you can try to fill in that quarter that's missing get a forecasted number the only problem with forecasted number is analysts don't forecast every item you might be able to get this for earnings but not for revenues you're going to see me use trailing 12 month numbers as my starting point because you want the most updated number and the realities around the world you will face different issues with trailing 12 month numbers for some not the quarterly numbers are the standard in the U.S and in much of the world but there are some parts of the world we have only semi-annual updates some parts of the world where you don't get full quarterly reports you get pieces being reported take what you can get get update what you can because your objective is to get the most updated valuation you can now once you get earnings you have to get from earnings to cash flows and I'll give you the standard equation earnings plus depreciation minus capex minus change in working capital here's where there can be an issue with what you've been taught in accounting and what we have to think about here I'll give you the account the the the big definition of capex that accounting claims to estimate a capital expenditure is any expenditure that creates benefits over many years that's what I would start my account my first class in accounting that if you have an expense that creates benefits over many years it's a capital expenditure now I want you to think about whether accountants are consistent with their own definition of capex and I'm going to give you a list of items and you tell me whether they meet the the the big definition of capex and whether they meet the accounting definition capex building a manufacturing plant clearly and they're the accounting and the right thing match up right so if you have a Manufacturing Company what you see as capex reflects true capex the land the building this up technology company though you have r d expenses pharmaceutical company is r d expense meet the the big picture Criterion for Kappa is or the question I'm asking is do companies do r d to get benefits this year or do you think they do r d to get benefits over the future it's like super capex right a pharmaceutical company who does already this year if it's luck you might get revenues 10 years from now but what do accountants do with r d screw it up big time they're expensive I'll talk about the rationale the use it makes no sense but they use it over and over but I'm going to argue that because they can they exp they can expense r d the financial statements for technology companies and pharmaceutical companies are completely screwed up their Ripple effects that come from it r d is capex it should be treated as capex how about advertising for a company like Coca-Cola you guys see the Super Bowl ads right you get these big name companies many of them are not advertising to go over now Budweiser Super Bowl ad since I don't know how long they don't expect you to maybe they do some of you might go and say I need six pack of Budweiser right now I just saw the ad the reality is some of this is to build a brand name to build an image that will pay off if you're lucky in long-term growth You could argue that some are a big chunk of the advertising expenses for a consumer product companies really capex and if you are a McKinsey or a KPMG think of what your biggest asset is what is KPMG or mckinsey's biggest ass people comes in at eight in the morning works till 10 at night or whatever it is it's human capital right so you know what the analogous capital expenditure is how do you increase your value recruiting and training expenses that you incurred but that human capital is really capex what I'm trying to say is the accounting definition of capex was designed for the old-time manufacturing company and when it was built every company was a big time manufacturer there were very few service companies it worked fine in the 1940s and the 50s and the 60s it is beyond getting frayed right now it's just broken because you look at the 10 largest market cap companies in the world there isn't a single manufacturing company on the list of the top 25 there's one manufacturing company that makes the list the rest are service companies technology companies pharmaceutical companies financial service companies and in all of those companies the accounting definition of capex doesn't match up to what we'd like the best so we'll talk about what to do about that today but that's the topic for today is to get from you know first get an updated measure of earnings and get to cash flows so let's go back to what the heck is that whoever that was I hope they did not not intend to show that but because everybody now has it on their Zoo okay so we're talking about the cost to that few last loose ends on discount rates let's complete them what do we say the cost is somebody repeat back to me what we're trying to estimate with the cost of debt first is it long term or short term what they borrowed at or what they would borrow it right now forward-looking it's it's what you can borrow at long term today that's a cost of debt right so I'm going to introduce a couple of twists here in the course of that you tell me what you would do there are some sectors which gets subsidized like what no green energy early on you know governments often gave loans Tesla in its early days got got bonds that were below that's that's what subsidized is you have a market rate based on your default risk and you're allowed to borrow to lower rate let's assume no that that we have subsidized that incidentally to get to a cost of debt you need default spread so we'll come back to that okay but basically we ended with synthetic ratings that's where I left you off and the synthetic ratings give you default spreads and default spreads change over time and you want the most updated spreads you can get if you look at the at my website you'll get the spreads at the start of 2023 but I'll also send you a link where you can check it at the start of every month they update the spreads great site free that's always something I look for in a site you know so I won't make you pay but you know you can go in there and check it's uh so you can get the updated defaults prints because they can change over a month over two months but I want to get to the subsidized that question yes now let's say let's take umbrella used to be a Brazilian government company now it's this Global aircraft manufacturer and Brazil was very proud about the emergence and growth of Empire it's a company that essentially became a global company from its Bristol base and the Brazilian government that says decides to lend to embryer at a below market rate if you remember the cost of debt I had for the company was 9.25 based on remember how we built up to restart with the risk-free rate then we added a default spread for embra and then a default spread for Brazil 9.25 is the rate you would charge them based on their risk the Brazilian government has lent to them at six percent below Market rates you're trying to compute a cost to Capital to use to value in brand so this is a very pragmatic question when you do your caustic Apple calculation for embryer should you use a six percent cost of debt because that's what they're getting it at should you use the market cost of debt of 9.25 percent or is there some intermediate solution you would adopt that actually lets you get to keep your cake and eat it too let's take the six and nine point two five percent if I use six percent that's my cost to debt in perpetuity I put it into my cost of capital what's a danger that I expose myself to as an investor what am I implicitly assuming about the subsidized debt that'll be subsidized forever right and we know subsidies kind of dissipate over time governments pull that so the problem with using six percent forever is I might be understating my cost of capital even after it's become a more normal cost of capital if I use the 9.25 as my cost to debt what's the mistake I'm making I'm missing the benefits I get from the subsidized act right because it is nice to have debt it's six percent when you should be paying 9.25 so in a sense I've ruled out the two extremes right is there a way I could use the 9.25 and bring the subsidy in in other words can I value the subsidy of here is just separately what would I do but then out of two costs of capital right to take away this so that's one solution to start with the six percent as it scales out move to nine point two five percent work through the cost of that right which is there another I mean if they break it down in their financial statements you could maybe wait how much they got the government loans which is a variation of the same theme let's just take the weight saves the weights over time when you borrow money forget about it you know and bro if let's say your actual cost of debt is nine percent and somebody lends you let's say you have 100 million dollars you borrow at six percent when you should be paying nine percent so it's a 10-year low is there a way for you to tell me how much that three percent subsidy works out as a gift to you you should be paying what nine million a year as interest you're paying only six million you're going to save three million dollars every year for the next 10 years you take the present value of the 3 million over the next 10 years you get a dollar value of the subsidy you know the advantage of doing this is once you have a dollar value of a subsidy you can always ask what does the government want in return for the subsidy trust me governments never give things away without expecting something in return there's always another you know another shoe waiting to drop here and you had what do I have to do in return I'll give you an example I was building a sugar company in India about 20 years ago for a family friend and sugar in India as the subsidy you get from the government so you get these prices they're higher than and this is true around the world U.S farmers get a subsidy so the the the I value the subsidy from getting that higher price but in return for the subsidy the sugar manufacturers are required to sell a portion of their sugar at below Mark below cost to a portion of the population that can't afford sugar so I valued at the cost and they were paying twice as much as they were getting as a benefit they weren't aware they thought of the benefit of we can't walk away that's a benefit and I said you really can walk away because what you're getting as a benefit is less than the cost but to do that you've got to identify the subsidy value it so here's my solution use the 9.25 as your cost of debt you're going to come up with the value of the company you're not quite done then take the amount of the bank loan you have from the government take the take that loan isolate the loan and take the present value of the benefits you're getting just because and then you'll make judgments 15 years the subsidy is going to go away it allows you to isolate the subsidy benefits and present it separately from your evaluation and it's good as an investor to know how much of your value comes from the business and how much is coming from subsidy any questions on subsidized staff yes you may have said this what rate do you use to discount if you'd actually use your 9.25 rate because that's your true cost of debt so take the 3.25 savings for the next 10 years discounted back at 9.25 because that's your true cost of debt what you get is a present value will then be the present value of the subsidy yes always be checked I think in the case of things like green energy green bonds it's going to last until green energy becomes more the norm than the exception so you are going to have to make a guess on that the history of subsidies is they don't last for more than 10 or 15 years so the subsidy might be for export oriented companies you know what you're not going to get that forever so it's usually for a finite period usually a fixed load what makes it easier is the government actually has a Term Loan just use the term of the loan use that as your your period of the subsidy and assume after that term you're not going to get react it's probably the most sensible thing to do in that okay so we have a cost of that that reflects the rate at which you can borrow it so let me bring this all together for embryer because I've been talking about Emperor off and on and I talked about Equity we did lambdas for Emperor so this was my caustic Capital calculation frame dryer let me start at the top I made a choice to estimate my cost of capital in US dollar terms because in 2004 the Brazilian government did not have 10-year Bonds in Riya so I basically had no choice but to go the dollar cash flow so it was a choice and because I made the dollar Choice the risk free rates you're going to see are going to be T Bond rates even though Empire is a Brazilian company so 4.29 is my t-bondering so that's the first choice the beta that you see there 1.07 is a bottom-up beta for embryo based on global aerospace companies if you don't remember that we we talked about that last session using Global averages so 1.07 is a levered beta for Empire based on global aerospace companies the four percent was the implied Equity risk premium for the s p five in the mature Market premium he's saying where's Brazil it's in that extra 7.89 premium this was a time when Brazil was considered a very risky country the country risk premium for Brazil was 7.89 percent and I estimated a Lambda that no because it brought us risk I was so worried about Brazil I focused on Brazil and this was the Lambda I got by running a regression of embryo returns against the seabond remember the Brazilian dollar denominated part risk-free rate plus beta times mature Premium Plus Lambda Times Country risk premium if I'd not been not computed Lambda what would it be different I'd use the beta but instead of the four percent I'd use a weighted average of four percent times the proportion 97 revenues came from Brazil three percent I'm sorry from U.S three percent from Brazil I could have used a weighted average in which case there'd be no Lambda but it's a dollar cost of equity the dollar cost of equity I have for Empire is 10.7 percent everybody so far risk-free rate in U.S dollars beta from a bottom of beta mature Market premium being the implied print for the S P 500 the land and the country risk premium mopping upbringing in the country risk let's move to the cost of data come back to the market value is Noah start with the same restricted as a general rule when you do cost you Capital your starting point for both your cost of equity and the cost of debt should be the same in other words you should be using a 10-year bond rate for equity and a 30-year bond rate for cost to debt same risk free rate two default spreads one for the country that's a four percent and one for embryo one percent remember we've got the synthetic rating cost of debt of 9.29 percent foreign tax rate is 34 marginal tax rate so I'm using that marginal tax rate to come up with the after tax cost today I've got a cost of equity of 10.7 percent a cost of debt of 9.2 percent 9.29 net of the tax benefit that was the based on the rating if you remember we compute an interest coverage ratio for embryo in the last class and then looked up the synthetic rating I think it was a plus or A's or no that was the default spread for the rating lots of moving pieces all coming together one calculation what's the last thing I need I need weights I'll State the first principle here the weights in a caustic Capital calculation should be market value rates repeat that again the weights in the cost should be market value rate so I need a market value of equity and I need a market value of debt which one is going to be easier to get it's a publicly traded company market value of equity I just took the share price times number of shares that is the 11.042 billion Rios that was easy market value of debt is really messy you know why because most debt at companies is Bank debt it doesn't trade if every company issued bonds you could look up the bond price and come up with market value but most debt in even in the US a lot of debt is Bank debt you don't have a market price so you know what Bankers do because there is no market price for debt they wave their hands for a little while and they say this is too difficult to estimate we're going to use Book value of debt as a proxy for market value I don't have a problem in most companies doing that but if you're doing Bed Bath and Beyond right now you think there might be a difference between the book value of debt and the market value of debt which one's going to be higher I mean the book value of debt is probably going to be four times higher than market value because the market value reflects the fact they're probably not going to pay so I'll give you a quick and dirty trick for converting book Debt to Market debt even if it's not trade you remember how to price a bond nod act like you do because if you if you don't we're in big trouble there's like three classes along the way how do you price a bot somebody help me you have the coupons you have the face value what do you do you take the present value of the coupons and the face value using a market interest rate right so the market interest rate goes up the price of the bond drops I'm going to draw on bond pricing to revalue the book value of debt so here's what you have when you see debt on a balance sheet that's like the face value of all the debt you have due right if you go to the income statement you see interest expenses like that's like the coupon you're paying on the debt and if you dig a little deeper in the footnotes you'll probably also see a measure when the debt comes to you so let's assume that you take the debt in this case it was about four-year debt you could see that in the footnotes the interest expenses were 222 million that came from the income statement the book value of debt is 1953 million came from the balance sheet so I've converted their entire debt into a gigantic coupon Bond a foil coupon bond with a coupon of 222 million and a face value 1953 million a price reprice the bond using the 9.29 market interest rate what I get as a present value is 2.083 million the book value of debt is 1953 million but in market value terms it's about 2.1 billion not a huge difference but I've converted book Debt to Market debt it's not going to make a huge difference in this calculation but you can see that by doing that my car my weights become 16 Equity 84 debt and my weighted average of cost to Capital is nine point nine seven percent so if you have booked that you want to convert it to Market debt you can do it if you have the maturity for the debt the interest expense and the face value which you should for most debt and then using the current market rate that you got as a pre-tax cost debt as the discount discount rate so what does it mean when when will book Debt and Market debt be roughly the same for a company what has to be true yes your book interest rate if I take your interest expense divided by a book where I lived at and I get eight percent your market rate is about eight percent as well your book Debt and Market there are going to be the same if your book interest rate is six percent and the market interest rate is eight percent then the market value of debt is going to be at a discount to book value just like you know in a bond if the coupon rate is lower than the market interest rate you're using exactly the same mechanics used for bond price here to convert Book value of debt to market value debt so all of these calculations this is the end game that becomes the cost to Capital you'd use to Value employer if you're doing evaluation in U.S dollar terms any questions why do you guys look shell shocked is Bond pricing that foreign you probably because you hit that yield to maturity but it's the present value equation so yes if you want me to describe it and calculate a mechanics here's what you will do take 222 million hit the payment button if you actually have a physical calculator if not the virtual calculator so 222 million is your payment n is equal to four years putting it the 1953 million as a future value and then hit the present value but then you're going to get the number that I got try it out when you get a chance essentially it's a present value problem that I'm solving treating all of the debt as if so you could compute let's say you get there with your company right you will that's you don't have to assume you will get there but you know even if I have to drag you there let's say you come up with a dollar cost a capital for your company why because you decided you wanted to do a dollar based valuation to Colombian Peso company or a Brazilian company so four weeks from now you have a cost to gap for your company in dollar terms and then you change your mind by currency it's like a major deal right so in this case let's assume I've got a dollar cost to Capital Empire and I said look I want to do my valuation in nominal reals go back and start from scratch right come up with a new risk free rate and realize come up and you could end up with a cost of capital doing that but I'll give you a much quicker way to convert your dollar cost to Capital to react cost of capital and it goes back to what we said about currencies why don't risk free rates vary across currencies differences in inflation right if the inflation rate in Brazil is eight percent the inflation rate in the US is two percent here's all you need to do to convert a dollar cost to Capital into a nominal real cost to Capital take one plus the dollar cost to Capital and just for the inflation effect that's a 1.08 now if you're in a hurry you can just add the six percent onto your dollar cost to Capital you get roughly the same number but if you want to do it right you take the compounded effect you come up with the dollar cost a capital of 16.44 percent get comfortable moving across currencies right because all it requires is you take a dollar cost per capotech inflation differences played out and you can convert a cost to Capital any currency to any other currency so my cost of capital at two ingredients right debt and equity and most of the time for most of your companies you're going to have debt and Equity but once in a while you'll get what are called hybrids you know what hybrids are hybrids are securities which are part debt and part equity I'll give you an example a convertible Bond somebody explained to me what a convertible bond is and why companies might issue it what does it convert what do you get with a convertible Bond who's your first let's be clear the buyer of the bond gets a bond so if you keep the bond what happens you get interest expense collect the coupon payments face value treat like but somewhere along the way you can convert the bond into shares at a pre-specified conversion ratio what has to be true about the stock price for you to do the conversion under what conditions would you convert if stock prices go up if stock prices go down yes in other words there's convertible bonds on Bed Bath and Beyond nobody's converting right they become all dead but if stock prices go up you might convert into equity the conversion option a convertible bond is equity the rest is debt so if you have a convertible Bond you can break it up into its debt and Equity components because leaving it as a hybrid leaves a mess right because if debt you have Equity that you're a convertible bond which is neither fish nor far so if you have convertible debt you can actually take the convertible debt break it down into its debt and Equity computers how am I going to do that I remember what he said like if you held the convertible Bond kept it as a bond water you're going to get coupons and face value right act like there's no conversion option value the convertible Bond as if it were a conventional Bond you're going to get a fairly low value because the coupons are probably low but price it as such that's the bond portion of your convertible Bond the rest the conver is all conversion option take it as equity your job in Costa capital is to keep it to two ingredients if you can you don't want to add a third ingredient unless you absolutely have to because otherwise you create these illusory ways of of lowering your cost to Capital which are really not true so if you have a convertible Bond break it out and see what portion is equity what portions did I actually break it down mechanically and send it to you when I when I when I when I send my email after the class so you can see how much of a convertible bond is detonated there's another type of hybrid that gives me nightmares I hate it it's called preferred stock preferred stock in Latin America is really common stock without voting rights so it's like you know it's regular Equity preferred stock in the US is like debt but that without any of the good stuff that comes with it and let me explain why in preferred stock when you issue the stock you set the dividend up front so unlike Equity where you get whatever's left over preferred stock I promise a six percent dividend every so it's like a bond right I've set the coupon rate of it but here's the difference when you pay interest on a bond it's tax deductible but new pay preferred dividends it's not it's a stupid way to raise capital and you know who issues the most preferred stock in the U.S Banks you know why they like it because it lets them win at the regulatory game banks are regulated based on regulatory capital and for whatever reason the regulatory authorities have decided to treat preferred stock as equity so what it allows Banks to do is issue debt and at the same time see their Equity go on the only problem is it's very expensive that right because you don't get any of the tax advantages so those of you valuing Banks it is entirely possible that 10 15 percent of your Capital comes from preferred stock and if you have preferred stock unfortunately you have to open a third front new cost of capitalist debt there's Equity there's preferred stock the wage will all add up to 100 but the cost of preferred stock is just your preferred dividend yield whatever the dividend is divided by the price should attribute cost of equity is a function of risk-free rates betas risk premiums cost to debt is a function of risk-free rates and default spreads and if you have preferred stock it's going to be whatever dividend you promise the weighted average across the three becomes the cost of capital for your company I promise you an email but I actually did this so let me show you how a convertible Bond could be broken down yeah this is actually a convertible bond with a with a face value of 125 million and a four percent coupon rate usually convertible bonds will have very low coupon rates because you're giving people a conversion option the convertible bond is trading at 140 million and you're trying to figure out how much of this 140 million is debt and how much is equity let's say based on the risk of the company and it's rating it should actually be paying eight percent remember the coupon rate is only four percent should actually be paying eight percent so I took the bond took the coupon four percent of 125 million the face value discounted the cash flows back at the eight percent rate which they should be paying and they get a value of 91.45 million that is the value of the bond portion of the convertible Bond remember the bond trades at 140 million you subtract the 91.45 million from the 140 million what's left the 48.55 million is the value of equity I put the 48.55 into Equity the 140 million in the 91.4 million into debt a problem goes away I no longer have a hybrid to worry about I've gone back to just debt Network that won't work for preferred stock but at least for convertible debt that option is there don't worry most of you will not have convertible debt in your in your financials so this is a very selective problem that some of you will have now and if you do have it as a problem just break it down move it into debt and Equity move on it's not if you want to treat it all as debt especially the stock price is down it's fine just move on because this is just an ingredient in Costa capital so I did that review of cost of equity now let's talk about what goes into cost of capital the cost of equity of course you said risk free rate beta risk premium you get a cost of equity cost of debt is a function of your default spread that default spread would reflect the risk of the company if it's a developed Market company but sometimes can spill over into country risk so you solve them right the tax rate you're multiplying it by reflects the tax benefits you get from borrowing and I'm going to introduce two different tax rates you're going to run into in this class and in finance that I want you to keep separate the first is called an effective tax rate the second is a marginal tax rate the first is what you'll see in financial statements you know you open up Capital like you you open up your 10K you see an effective tax rate somebody just defined for me how accountants compute an effective tax rate per company what is it what does it measure yeah it's basically accrual taxes divided by accrual and taxable income so if you go to the income statement they have tax accrual taxable income of 100 million accrual tax of 20 million 20 divided by 100 is 20 percent do any of you use do your own taxes with Turbo Tax or any of the tax software you don't have any incomes I guess it doesn't really make a difference but you will one day have income and have to report taxes okay but one of the most depressing things about Turbo Tax is when you're done just I think to make you feel pissed off they'll say congratulations this year you paid 28.33 percent of your adjusted gross income in taxes and here's what they do they take your taxes paid and divide by be glad if you get 28 but if you work in the New York area it's going to be more like 47.53 to 56.22 they take your taxes that that are coming you divide by a just gross income they're doing an effective tax rate that's what an effective tax rate is the average effective tax rate for U.S companies last year was about 18 and a half to 19 percent so that's effective tax rate it's going to vary across companies some companies have single digit effective tax rates some have effective taxes 23 24 25 percent what's a marginal tax rate it's a tax rate in your last dollar of income it comes from the tax code right so somebody helped me out here if you're a corporation in the U.S what is a marginal tax rate look like right now what's a federal corporate tax rate it's 21 right plus you have state taxes low remember the U.S you have multiple layers of taxes and roughly speaking it's about 25 percent so you got an effective tax rate of 16 17 18 the marginal tax rate 25 the margin tax rate 25 is the same for every company which makes money because you get to that 25 very where there's no tax bracket for companies you hit that very quickly when we do cost of debt which of those tax trades do you think we we are using I mean I gave you the answer but why why do we use a marginal tax rate you go back to turbo taxes let's suppose you have income I don't want to insult you let's say you have a million dollars in income if that's still insulting add an extra zero right you have a million dollars in income and you have a hundred thousand dollars in interest expenses tell me what happens in your taxes you take the million you subtract out the hundred thousand your taxable income of nine hundred thousand on which you pay taxes right think of where you saved on taxes it wasn't on the first hundred thousand it wasn't on the middle hundred thousand it was in the last hundred thousand that tax rate is going to be much higher than what you paid in the first hundred thousand but that's the tax rate that you should be using for your after tax cost of debt because you save taxes at the margin outputs effective tax rate last year was about 15 percent why because there's a lot of foreign income on which it pays lower taxes than the US but guess where all of Apple's debt is parked it's all in the U.S getting tax benefits at the 25 percent so the tax rate we use to come up with after tax cost of debt is a marginal tax rate the weights on market value rates but along the way lots of little places we can stumble and forward right in terms of risk free rates and betas and risk premiums so my suggestion is keep no take those big picture pages and work backwards think of this like a web page we click and you go to a bigger page because you start with the detail it's very easy to get lost think of the big picture what you're trying to estimate with the cost of capital any questions on cost of capital so let's talk about estimated cash flows did I get the right picture so I'm going to first set set the table here there are two ways you can estimate cash flows and this goes back to what we talked about very early in the class you got to make a judgment on whether you're going to estimate cash flows to equity or to the firm pre-castrated equities cash flows left over after debt payments free cash for the firm Are cash flows before debt payments I've set the calculations next to each other so you can compare them with each other when you do free cash flows Equity you start with net income why because you're an equity investor you think about income from your perspective it's Equity income net income when you start free cash for the firm you start with operating income why because you're looking at a pre-debt number net income is opted you subtract out the taxes now from the operating income that you would have paid if the entire operating income had been taxed so basically your starting points are different net income in one case after tax operating companies with both cash flows you subtract out what you're going to put back into the firm and I'm going to talk about three items here that will go in one is depreciation that in a sense is cash available to you to cover your capex this capex which includes what you're putting in for future growth and of course you have working capital think of that as investment in short-term assets to keep going as a company that's the same in both cash flows with free cash to the firm after you've subtract those you're done you got a free cash for the firm with free cash flow Equity or one more stop because you're an equity investor you have to worry about cash coming in when you borrow money and cash going out when you repay that you're going to bring in the debt payments as a separate item I want you to hold on to this page because as you look at the two calculations look like you're doing different things but you're actually doing the same thing but to different claim holders in the company so we go through each item because obviously what is capex what is working capital what is depreciation or items we've got to deal with but that's the end game so let's start with each of these cash flow calculations and set the process up each of the cash flow calculations we're going to start with earnings number right net income in one operating income in the other which means you have no choice but to be able to read financial statements that's why at the start of the class I said if your accounting is weak you're going to struggle with valuation because you're still trying to figure out what's the difference between operating income and net income what's the Habit as opposed to operating income so get yourself comfortable reading a financial stake is going to start with current products and there I'm going to talk about a couple of things we need to do make sure you get the most updated numbers you can and then clean up for your accountants things that they might have misclassified second stop you're going to stop and see how much the company is reinvesting back into the business of course we trust the accountants you're going to look at traditional capex land building equipment but I'm going to argue think think wider if you're a technology company that r d expenditure it's incurring is capex if you're uber or Netflix what's your biggest capex where does your value come from having more subscribers having more writers right so it's the analogous capex how do you get those new writers and it's a cost of acquiring new subscribers and New Riders now has to become your capex so we're going to talk about defining what you're going to reinvest do you have to reinvest that can a company choose not to reinvest yeah but if you do that what kind of growth should you give them either zero growth or negative growth which is fine so if you want to assume your company will not reinvest I'm not going to stop you but you better not be telling me a soaring story of 40 growth for the next 10 years while putting nothing back in the business we're already starting the elements of preserving consistency when you tell stories looking at cash flows to equity you got to bring in how much are the cash flows from in two days now along the way you're going to see multiple ways of getting free especially when you start working through past quizzes you're going to say they're true now hundreds of ways of getting free cash for the firm not really it's the algebra kind of working in different ways I'll start with the traditional definition of free cash flow after tax Avid plus depreciation minus capex minus change in working capital so those become your reinvestment gives you free cash to the phone if I consolidate those three numbers I can call them reinvestment I'm not changing the equation I'm just consolidating what's being put back into the business in long term and short-term assets so when you see free cash flow minus reinvestment reinvestment already includes working capital Acquisitions r d Etc that's why in all my valuations you've seen so far there's been only one line item look at the aramco valuation look at the tell you know look at the valuation of um of adani group look at the there's only one line item that line item includes capex depreciation working capital all consolidated I can even take the reinvestment and state it as a percentage of the after tax operate income so instead of telling you there's a a hundred million dollars in after tax operate income and I'm reinvesting 30 million I can say I have a reinvestment rate of 30 percent am I changing the question no I'm just restating so what I'm trying to say is when you see these different variants show up they're basically trying to get to the same end game I'm not giving you three different free cash of the firm I'm still trying to get to the same end Place how much cash flow do I have before I make my debt payments oh if you look at that calculation one of the things that um always puzzles people is I take the operating income and I act like I get taxed on the operating income and I don't right I get to subtract our interest expenses it looks like I'm completely ignoring the tax benefits of debt when I do cash flows I'll take the looks like out of the way I am ignoring the tax benefits from debt when I do the cash flows well I'm able to get away with it aren't those real benefits because when I discount them I discount them back at a cost of capital what goes into cost of capital cost of equity and uh after tax cost to debt my tax benefits of debt are already in my discontract if I count the same tax benefits and increase my cash flows I'll be double Counting 3 in 10 discounted cash flow valuations I see double count the tax benefits from interest expenses they just subtract Actual taxes pay from after from operating income you can't do that if you're doing a cost to Capital valuation your cash flows should not include the tax benefits from that I can do the same thing with free cash flow Equity okay it's a free cash flow Equity I could write the full equation out net cash net income minus reinvestment plus debt but I can consolidate right I can take the capex depreciation working capital and write it as reinvestment and the cash flows from debt as a net debt cash flow or I can simplify even further I can make that Consolidated number I can call it Equity reinvestment so if you see me because you hear me use these words the reinvestment is I wanted to step back and say no that reinvestment includes so don't ask me where's the working capital change where are the Acquisitions it should all be consolable number we do it for convenience so that when we do projections we're not projecting at five line items were projecting one line item before the class you know what's your name again Jason and I were talking about projections he's actually way ahead of the cash flows you should be a little jealous he's projecting cash flow of the future and he has you know when you look at financial statements he has lots of line items he's doing a Chinese company 10 line item 15 line items and as you project line items you're going to pull your hair out because you're trying to protect working capital projecting a capex you're protecting depreciation projecting Acquisitions projecting r d my advice when you're projecting multiple line items if you consolidate you actually have a much better shot of projecting the Consolidated item than each individual line item I'll send you a link I did this for Microsoft a few months ago just because I saw so much confusion in how people are Computing free cash flows that I said okay let's take a company apart so we can see what the numbers look like so this is from Microsoft I'm not suggesting there's anything specially learned from it but essentially to illustrate how we get from after tax operating income to free cash flow okay so let's start with three cash flow Equity there's my net income green there's my reinvestment that's capex depreciation Acquisitions that's the the chunk out of the there's my debt cash flows and there's my free cash flow Equity so you can see that my reinvestment in my debt cash flows went out of my net income to give me a lower free cash flow equity you have free cash for the firm there's my after tax operating income that's really there's my tax I'm sorry there's my operating income there are my taxes my reinvestment my free cash flow essentially we start with earnings and work our way to free cash for the fund by looking at what has to leave the income before I get clear claim on the cash flows so as we go through this process we're going to take each item and we're going to spend some time what operating income what tax rate what capex what depreciation what working capital but as you know don't get lost in the details step back and think about what we're trying to do we're trying to get let's do a free cash for the firm calculation and all of these details are essentially helping us get there you guys look like you're ready for a long weekend so I'm not going to drag you through but I at least want to get this process started as I said the first step in this process is accounting honors now this is where you're going to start your valuation you're going to start with an annual report or you know set of annual reports and you're going to say hey what did this company make I already talked about why it's so critical why it's so critical to update the numbers because you want a valuation as of right now not six months ago nine months ago so the updating part and we talked about how to update look trailing 12 month numbers you know but there are two other things that I think you might want to think about you know the most most profitable companies last year were oil companies made a lot of money last year especially with trailing for McDonald's why were trailing 12-month earnings for oil companies so high last year because oil prices between October and of 2021 and September of 2022 were high if I take those trailing 12-month numbers for an Exxon Mobil or Royal Dutch and let them grow at three percent a year from now on I'm going to overvalue these companies why because oil is cyclical it goes up it goes down even in the last three years it's gone from thirty dollars a barrel at the peak of covet to a hundred plus dollars a barrel in just a year ago so what's the fix for it one of the things we'll talk about commodity companies is normalizing on which is a nice word for instead of using last year's earnings I'm going to look at an average earnings over the last three years last five years across the cycle not easier said than done but normalizing earnings is basically a way of saying earnings go up earnings go down I don't want to build a castle on top of last year's numbers the other of course is this accounting issue that I talked about that accountants are not always consistent about the way they classify expenses that there's one Financial expense that they're routinely used to categorize as an operating expensive finally thank God they're fixed what am I talking about 2019 accountants came to their Center leases I'm going to talk about why leases have always been debt in the 30 plus years I've been reporting numbers I've always treated Lisa as Dead starting in 2019 accountants seemed to have joined me which should make me a little nervous but no thank God they've come to the from the Dark Side to the light side on this one I'm going to talk about why I've always treated Lisa as dead and why accountants have come to the same recognition the other expense I'm going to talk about is an expense we just start started this class with which is r d this is an OP which is a capital expense but routinely treated as an operating experience so I want to spend the rest of this class talking about why we make those fixes and how it can change the way you think about a company the updating earnings part nothing magical here if you can get four quarters of earnings put together for some you're going to get lucky because for many of you by next month you should be getting your your annual report but for some of your companies remember your ends don't always have to be December 30th right if you're valuing I think Disney is what September 30th of each year so if you have a company who's your end is September God help you because you're not going to get an annual report that reflects where you are now you'll have to use the trailing 12 month numbers but it's better to always use updated numbers to value your company and the younger your company the more critical it is that you update the numbers do you see why can a lot happen to a young company in six months absolutely if you don't believe me you're valuing a young company take a look at the last 10K and take a look at the trailing 12 month numbers your revenues could have doubled or hacked your losses could have quadrupled or become profits updating is not this minor issue it can make a huge change in how you think about the company so let's talk about the two accounting mistakes the first is lease I'll give you my rationale for why leases are dead and then I'm going to expand the discussion because it's not just about leases it's about any expense that looks like leases and guess what there are quite a few of those that you might have to factor in then you value company so I'm going to talk about how to convert an operating expense into a financial expense accountants do that for you with leases but at least you can take you through the process you can see it's not rocket science the second is a capital expense that's being treated as an operating expense I'm going to take you through the logic of why irid has always been a capex why accountants have mistreated it through its life and what to do about bring them back so let's start with leases what makes that that sounds like a weird question but human being what is it about that that makes you treat it separately from Equity go back to the basics you have debt and Equity what is it about that that you look for to to separate from equity yes it's a contractual claim right so if you have a contractual claim as opposed to residual claim you're going to treat itself so Bank debt obviously that corporate bonds obviously that help me out again if you sign a lease agreement you're you're a retailer you sign a 10-year lease at a store are you signing a contract oh I think so right is a lease to me that's the basis right if you have a contractual payment it should be done so you're saying why did accountants treat leases as operating expenses for as long as they did they had this weird fixation on ownership you know let me explain what what I mean by fixation ownership they said if you will not own the asset at the end of the contractual period it's really not debt try using this logic with your landlord you know I don't really own the apartment so I don't feel the urge to pay you every month you're not going to be in the apartment very long it's a stupid line to draw but they used to divide leases into operating leases and capital leases so we had effective ownership of an asset they would say that's a capital lease we're going to treat it as that but if you don't have ownership then it's an operating lease and we're not going to treat it I said we're going to treat as an operating expense foreign at the edges a long time ago you know when accountants realized they had a problem with leases I actually found a panel it was a brochure those days I'd be physical brochure that people said that about a panel discussion that was going to happen at the then NYU School of Business never no it wasn't called Stern on how leases should be treated as that 1949 1949 is when accountants realize that a problem why didn't they do something about it 2019 that'll give you a rough timeline between when accountants realize there's a prom and something gets done 70 years what I'm trying to say is if you think accountants are doing something wrong don't wait for them to do it right it might take until what 22nd century just do it yourself and doing it yourself is not a big deal to convert leases from operating to financial expenses here's what I need to do I need to get your contractual commitments you've entered into so I'll go through your contract and say this is how much and you know what U.S companies have been reporting that in the footnotes for the last 40 years you take the present value of those commitments that becomes your debt value so I'm going to show it as debt on your balance sheet so if you owe 100 million next year 200 million the year after I'm going to take the present value of those commitments I'm going to treat this down but balance sheets have this very unpleasant requirement which is they have to balance right so if I take the present value of leases and treat it as debt I have an unbalanced balance sheet and I think you're going to have trouble getting it past the Auditors so to make balance sheets balance what do I have to do I have to create a lease asset it's called a counter asset it's a balance sheet balance and once I have an asset what do you have to do in subsequent periods as an accountant I need to write it off it's like give the mouse a cookie time right have you ever read this book I used to love it I love reading it to my kids give them as a cookie I'll tell you the story because you look a little jaded that's what happens the mouse gets invited in you give the mouse a cookie and the mouse says I want a glass of milk very demanding Mouse you give it a glass of milk makes a mess the mouse gets in the bat the whole thing is this one thing on top of the other this is very much like give the mouse a cookie you thought you were done when you took the present value of least commitment because guess what it's got a ripple effects it's going to create an acid which is going to create depreciation now you got to go back and restate your income statement because those lease expenses are no longer operating expenses you know I would depreciate you're saying what a nightmare but at least it's a repeating nightmare it's exactly the same thing every single time it's built into every single amount of evaluation spreadsheet we want leases I'll convert it for you I've done it for 30. it's basically this same process but I'll give you an example using a real company so you can see how this would work out so the Gap in 2003 okay you know who has the most leases I might have skipped that page what kinds of companies do you think have this operating lease commitment most lease commitments one is retail restaurants Airlines sometimes because depending on how they're classified most Airlines used to be capitalisters but some of them managed to get through shipping companies so you can see that leases are not equally a problem for everybody technology companies not a big deal right it's not like Facebook or Google enter into 15-year leases so this is the gap big retail store at that time now a much smaller retail store probably getting even tinier as you go through time these were the contractual commitments that they showed in the footnote so what do you see in the footnotes for a U.S company as lease commitments are not expected lease payments they're contractual commitments so 8.99 year one day and Beyond year five U.S companies were quite sure lump sum they didn't have to break it down anymore of commitments beyond your fund so basically the Gap said but one thousand I just split it up into two years because I don't think it's all going to come during here's all I did I took those lease commitments discounted them back at the pre-tax cost of debt so in terms of sequencing do you see why I had to do the cost to Capital first because that gave me the cost of equity in the cost of debt that pre-tax cost to that becomes a discount rate you take the present value of the lease commitments what you get is a present value is 4.4 billion dollars okay I'm going to put that on the balance sheet instead if you thought retailers had very little debt prior to 2019 it's because you were trusting the accountants most of their debt took the form of lease commitments and that debt was not on the books I'm now bringing it on the books so the 4.4 billion dollars becomes dead outstanding which almost more than doubles it actually triples the amount of debt that the Gap that is the debt I'm going to use in my cost of capital calculation but it's also going to mean that I've got to go back and redo my operating income the operating income the accountants used to report used to be after lease expenses and now I'm claiming hey those are not really operating expenses are Financial expenses the definition of operating comes before Financial expenses so add back the actual lease expense from this you're saying I shouldn't have subtract that but evolution to tie up if I had been trading leases as debt there would be an asset which would be depreciating I have to separate now editor it's not particularly Pleasant thing to do but at least it's the same thing over and over their operating income by just releases is closer to 1.36 billion there's a shortcut you can use which sometimes if you're in a hurry you can know but the shortcut basically takes the interest payment you'd have had on the debt and say I should add that back because it's earnings before interest and taxes is operating income I actually did this for the gap because their management was interested at that time the accountants were talking about how Lisa should be dead at first when the Gap called me I said do you know how slowly accountants act by the time they get to it'll probably be a decade I underestimated how long it will actually take them they said we'd still like to know what our numbers would look like if leases are treated as that I said okay so I'm going to take you through the presentation I made to them of what would happen to their numbers if Lisa converted that and I'll tell you up front that they went through various stages of delirium before coming back down to earth so I said okay let me show you your actual numbers now and what the numbers look like what leases treated as that so the First Column is what the accounting looked like in 2007. their operating income according to the accountants was 1.012 billion I said that's not really true because you're subtracting at least expenses I'm going to capitalize lease expenses remember the from the previous page and you know and add back that lease expense subtract the depreciation your true operating income is 1.362 million you can see people patting each other like this is good we're making more money than we thought we said okay so let the delirium build up and then I met plenmore I said if I treat Lisa as dead then your debt only go up and they said is this a good thing is that a bad thing I said it's no people might be worried about that but it's a good thing from your cost to Capital perspective because your cost of capital now will have a much bigger debt ratio and a lower cost of capital at this stage they're hitting the ceiling saying this is great our earnings are higher cost of capital is lower well it's a great place to be in and then I said this one small catch the way we measure the quality for companies by looking at what kind of returns you make on your invested capital with the old accounting investor Capital included only conventional debt and the return on Capital they were making was 12.9 percent but if I treat leases as dead and bring it into my debt my return on Capital drops to 9.3 percent they said what does this all mean will it be good for us bad for us it's a very simple metric you can use to see how leases will affect the company value comes from making excess returns over and above your cost of capital what does the excess return the company was making before 12.9 percent minus 7.31 right roughly 5.59 percent what are they making after the adjustment about 3.05 percent the net effect here was it lowered the value of the Gap because it made them a less attractive company I did this for Starbucks at the time and this was when Starbucks was just going crazy now this is when you need Wi-Fi in New York all you need to do was Point your laptop and there was a Starbucks at that time Wi-Fi was cheap in Starbucks no and there was one every block right you missed the Starbucks there's one one block further down they were competing with each other they've gone crazy but on a conventional accounting basis it looked like they were making 14 returns but this was a company growing by putting leases in the middle of the most expensive real estate you converted the leases to debt that 14 became seven percent and that was less than the cost of capital it took three years for Starbucks to realize they were opening stores in places they shouldn't be opening them in they had to come back shut down like five and they go through this cycle over and over again it's not healthy to realize to not recognize how much you're investing and that's exactly what you're doing when you don't capitalize leases if you don't know how much you've borrowed you're going to do some really stupid things and that's effectively what was happening pre-2019. so why again remind me again what is it about leadsis that makes me treat them as that the contractual commitments right you're going to make them in good times and bad times and if you value Netflix nobody's running Netflix some of you will I know by the end you'll be like five people value Netflix because you wouldn't have picked a company you'd be watching some Netflix shows oh my god I've got to pick a company you're going to end up picking Netflix turn on Netflix it's not as bad as it used to be you have this menu of shows right some are original content but you know until last year the most watched shows this might still be true for Netflix I think last year the most watched show on Netflix was France but two years ago until they lost the contra you're most watched show on Netflix is not stranger things or you know whatever the new show is it's some old show that's how does Netflix get the rights to these shows in fact they had They Carried the rights to the Avengers movies until three years ago how do they get the rights to these movies they basically go to the original content provider Disney in the case of Avengers is entered a five-year agreement to pay a hundred million dollars every year for the next five years in return they can show The Avengers show contractual commitment if you look at the Netflix footnotes take a look at it they'll have lease commitments which are already converted but they also have content commitments they still have I think 15 billion dollars in content commitments spread out over three four five years I think we should be treating it as dead it's exactly like that one final example and we'll end for the day I'm a Yankee fan it's not a Mets fan Yankee fan and 2009 the new Yankee stadium got built and I decided to take three of my four children to the game the opening day in Yankee Stadium this is going to sound sexist but I actually took my three sons and not my daughter I gave her a chance but she said will there be Dippin Dots there I said I'm not taking you to Yankee Stadium and spending half the game looking for Dippin Dots I'll get to the Dipping Dots at home you just eat it here you don't have to come to Yankee Stadium and look for Dippin Dots so I took my three sons and we get sick tickets in the bleachers right good you know it's opening day it's a day game and the Yankees come running onto the field the home home team always you know is on the field first and here's what I saw I saw a guy called Mark Teixeira right to first base and as he was running up I thought about 23 million dollars every year for the next five years guaranteed thank you then I saw this guy called Robinson canoran to second base he was a relatively cheap debt he had like 20 million for the next three years and he had Derek Jeter go to shortstop I think it was 26 million every year for the next four years and then I looked towards third base and there was an imposter that day the guy was supposed to run out was a guy called Alex Rodriguez he was owed 27.5 million dollars every year for the next 10 years on the mound was a guy called CC Sabathia I think 18 million a year every year for the next four years and behind the plate was Jorge Posada 15 million for three years this is a very sick thing to do but then like the game was done I took the present value of the contractual commitments in the infield forget about the Outfield I came up with the total present value of 600 million dollars in the infield if you're a Mets fan this year Walk Hard and take compute the present value of your commitment there and be glad they did not get Carlos Correa for 30 million for the next 10 years but if you're a soccer fan and you want to look at PSG and the contracts they've entered into this is more than just leases it's contractual commitments and why you have to worry about them selves yeah thank you um thank you 
looks like you can turn your cameras on and make my life a lot easier to speak to faces rather than gray boxes so please do foreign foreign first things first I mean you probably received that email from like before before I gave you the two day break when I sent you the the quiz past quizzes links to the Past quizzes and review session just a reminder that your first quiz is a week from today right so I will send you another email today with the past quizzes the review session links again just in case you've lost the last one and also you know it's um don't put off preparing for the quiz to the next Tuesday it'll be too late so in a sense it's best to get started over the weekend and you need to work work through past quizzes it's not just reviewing the slides and saying I kind of get it you need to actually work through the step one more thing about the quiz I will send you room instructions because 351 people which is what we have in this class in Paulson at one time is catastrophic I mean there's no way you can actually work through a quiz there are too many people too much stress too much crowding so what I have is two other rooms that I've got for the 30 minutes the quiz is only in the first 30 minutes of class so I've got two other rooms so I'm going to send you an email as to which room you should go to for the quiz so that we can spread people out they're more room to put your stuff out because you're going to be looking at you know notes and you know it's open book open Notes open iPads even laptops as long as you just use them to review your slides not to use Excel or any of the other tools so that's a week from today first 30 minutes of class I just want to let you know your class the quiz is in person so I want to also make that clear it's going to be in person spread across three rooms and if you're going to miss the quiz you need to let me know before the quiz so by 3 30 on next Wednesday you need to let me know I'm not coming to the quiz because you'll give me the reason if you do miss the quiz as you know the 10 gets moved to the remaining quizzes in the final but you lose the option of dropping the worst quiz this will be your worst quiz if you missed the quiz so keep that in mind when you think about maybe I'll miss the quiz because I don't feel ready because it might not be strategically the best decision for you so that long lead and let's talk about some of the things we're going to cover today with the start of the class test and today's start of the class test I'm going to focus on a few loose ends we're going to cover with cash flows so here's the first one some of you should have money losing companies why because I required at least one person in every group pick a money losing company maybe you're that unlucky person with a money losing company and if anybody in this first Gallery with the money losing company is your company where the heck are the money losing company people they're not here so here's my question when um no one of the tactics you can use it's often the simplest tactic to deal with money losing companies is to replace the laws with the average income over the last five years so if you have a company that had lost last year but made profits in previous years replacing it's called normalizing it's kind of a fancy word for here just replacing last year's numbers with an average number when you do that when you take the last five years average and replace last year's number with that five-year average which of the following assumptions are you making in your valuation the first is that that loss you saw last year was unusual the companies historically made money is that a fair assumption that that you're making yeah that the problems that caused the laws have largely gone away they're right you're producing the laws with the average income you're saying problems have gone away the business has not changed in fundamental ways it's not being disrupted so you can go back to what you used to do the company is not scaled up or down in the last five years why does that matter because the company gets bigger or smaller using average earnings over a period can be a little misleading every single assumption in that list is being made by you so before you just replace last year's number with an average of five years be very careful because it might work for a few companies but it doesn't work for a lot of companies because the assumptions you need to make to get there so when you get your money losing company take a look at the loss take a look at previous years and before you jump in and take this normalizing route check to see what these assumptions are meant today we'll also get to free cash flow equity which is an after that cash flow cash flow to equity investors so let's say you're valuing a young company and you're projecting out free cash flow Equity You're Expecting negative free cash flows to equity for the next five years what does that mean when you have negative free cash flow Equity what are you assuming the company will have to do each year yes go ahead Jason it should be growing in a pretty fast pace and also but the negative free cash rate Equity also tells you something about what they will need to do in capital markets right that they will have to raise Equity every year to cover that negative free cash flow equity you discount those free cash flow Equity back at the cost of equity to get to the value of equity day implicitly you're assuming that your company will be able to raise the cash flows to cover that free cash flow Equity is that a safe assumption because we do that every young company is negative free cash flow Equity we discount them back is it safe to assume that they will always be able to raise these negative free cash Capital to cover these negative free cash flows Jake I I see nor you had no tell me why what can happen um I kind of just spitballing here but maybe the like the company's investor basis losing confidence in the business or I mean if you've been reading the articles about Venture capitalists Venture capitalists are now getting more scared you can see in the way they're investing so you've been dependent on Wednesday capitalist for your free cash for Equity all of a sudden the world has changed around you venture capital is kind of pulled back it happened in 2001. it might happen again in 2023. put simply if that happens you're never going to get to Nirvana which in your evaluation is in your 10 with the big terminal value so is it a safe assumption perhaps if you're looking at a market where you feel pretty secure about that market staying healthy for the next five or ten years get away with it if not you've got to bring in the likelihood that this might not be a good assumption you know how you bring it in if you've ever if you've had a chance look at the fcff Ginsu simple Ginsu spreadsheet that I sent you one of the inputs I let you set is a failure rate what is the chance my company will not make if you have a nice money making company that number is going to be close to zero but if you have a company with negative free cash flow equity and saying what if something goes wrong that becomes the mechanism that used to bring in the likelihood that something could go wrong and you might not be able to raise that free cash or equity so today we'll talk about free cash flow Equity because it does convey information to your body evaluation that you might find useful in valueing the company so let me stop the these slides and go back to the lecture note packet so if you remember last session we talked about why leases are really debt and why we need to capitalize them but I also extended that discussion right they said anytime you enter into a contractual agreement you're effectively borrowing money you guys soccer friends some of you must be you know what Ronaldo's contract with all nasar the Saudi Arabian soccer clubish but then what is what is this contract anybody Daniel do you know no 75 million each year for the next three years this guy's not exactly poverty stricken now I'm not suggesting you have to Value all necessary but if you're valuing all necessary as a club guess what that three-year contract is debt so here's the bottom line when accountants miscategorize contractual claims as operating expenses as we used to do with leases they missed State operating income mistake I didn't say understate or overstate the mistake they subtract out the least expenses they should do so the operating income is wrong they also mispecified they under report that the actual debt you see on the balance sheet is not the true debt of the company and they're also missing an asset so in other words the income is misstated the debt is wrong the assets are wrong so let's be clear about why we capitalize that capitalized leases we capitalize leases because we want to correct the operating income you correct the operating room by adding back the lease expense saying I should never have subtracted and subtracting our depreciation you're correct for debt by capitalizing the leases and treating it as debt and you also bring in an asset so what you're effectively doing when you capitalize leasing is correcting for the accounting mistake that led to this flaw in the first place until 2019 I used to have to do this with every company that I value that's why it's built into you against the spreadsheet is that lease conversion worksheet is every company that I entered into identities commitments it was public information wasn't like I had any secret source of information and converted least commitments to debt so and it took accounting a long time to come to its census 2019 70 years after admitting there was a problem they finally dealt with the problem saying why did it take so long I'll take a charitable view the reason accounting takes so long to deal with its mistakes even though it knows it's a mistake is because there's a legacy effect right so much of accounting is built on the way that it is we have CPAs were churned out with the old accounting rules you can't abandon those rules quickly because it leads to all kinds of side consequences the second is every time accounting talks about doing the right thing I remember in 2007 accountants said we need to be treating employee options as expenses sensible thing to do because when you give our employees options as part of compensation it is an expense I said I should I said thank you for doing it you know who pushed back against accountants technology firms they said don't do this it'll kill us it'll kill us because if you treat these these options as expenses going to lower income true but it's actually the truth that you're fighting here not the fact that income is being lowered it took accounting almost six years to fight through the lobbying from Tech firms before they were able to do it but finally in 2019 IFRS and Gap chose the path of capitalizing leases so starting in 2019 accountants have been capitalizing leases but in parallel because I have access to the raw data it's still in the footnotes I've been capitalizing leases as well to see how close I am to the because we're both doing the same thing right we have the same lease commitments we should Converge on the same number I was trying to see am I coming in pretty close to what accountants are doing in the U.S I'm actually pretty close I have I I come up with a higher value so my estimate of leases is always higher because I have no Escape clauses accounting gives companies Escape losses if you have renewable leases they sometimes allow you to escape so I understand my least commitments are higher but I'm pretty close in the US right my estimate is but if you look across the world you can see that in much of the world what accounting is reporting is least debt is much lower than what I would get if I use the raw data what I'm trying to say in an indirect way is if a Japanese company or an Asian company even if accountants claim to have capitalized leases and shown it as debt don't trust them do it yourself it's not rocket science the least commitments are there because there are too many Escape Clauses built into these contracts allowing companies to evade the rules so any questions about why leases are debt and how to convert leases to that okay let's talk about r d again let's look at where what sectors you're most likely to see r d as a big issue so what I've done here is listed the 10 sectors where r d is the biggest percentage of Revenue and the 10 sectors where it's the smallest it's a nobody the alcoholic beverage business is doing a lot of r d what are you going to do r d on rum is from you know beers beer they are deer is at the margin but if you look at the other side you see a lot of Pharma companies not surprisingly you see a lot of technology companies Telecom equipment has now become a big r d Spender and Automobiles are climbing up the wrecks so when you look at the kind of company of value and I assume you've picked a company depending on which sector you're in what I'm going to say next is going to have significant impacts on how you value your company or how you think about your company let me give you again my rationale for y r d is really capex if you go back to my original definition of capex my definition of capex is any expense that creates benefits over many years let me repeat that again capex is any expense that creates benefits over many years that's why land is a capex buildings are capex machineries capex but let's do the test on R D does any company do r d expecting to get a benefit this year not unless it's crazy if you're lucky maybe in two years if you're a pharmaceutical company maybe in 10 years r d is there's no contest is capex it's always been capex so why do you think accountants have insisted on treating it as an operating expense what is the rationale that accountants get actually about 12 years ago I was asked to give a keynote at the aicpa conference you know the aicpa conferences it's basically CPAs from around the country and ironically you know where the Conference was held was in Vegas accountants in Vegas some of the kinds sounds to me like there's a contradiction why in Vegas because they have the biggest room so there's a thousand CPAs in this room and for whatever reason they invited me to give their Keynote I don't think they're going to invite me back again because the title of my keynote is 10 things that accounting does that I don't quite get and one of them happened to be leases I said what are you guys doing with leases they fix that but one of the questions I raised was why do you guys keep expensing r d it seems to violate your basic principle of what capex is supposed to be so I'm going to ask you to guess these are all thousand accountants they're all expense r d every day of every year what are the reasons you think accounting gives for expensing r d think like an accountant for a moment think or use your accounting class to get perspective what are the reasons accounting has for expensing r d anybody to try go ahead Yuki would it be like tax benefits would it be like what I'm sorry what sorry it's a little while in here um would it be tax benefits benefits um so expand on it so when you say so give me the logic for it why that would lead you to expense something like if you if you if you had if you expense R D um would it lead to like income tax benefits like you pay less oh that's a good reason I wish they'd given me that reason but be careful if you get that reason the tax guy is going to say hey you guys are cheating us that would be actually a sensible reason right you get bigger tax benefits that wasn't the reason they were thinking like accountants you're thinking like a common sense person I'll give you a clue uncertainty what do you think they're rational go ahead press pronounce I was going to say that they're saying r d is like it's an OP they like an operating expense because it has to do with profitability so like they have to expense it like an operating expense like every year that's a that's a strength what do you mean has to do with profitability everything has to do cash in cash out you build land you know you build it you build a factory it affects your profitability you can't use that as your as your rule for Capital exp for deciding operating expense and something right yeah you don't you don't take a blend of building and treat it as an operating expense even though it affects your profitability foreign everything affects your profitability think about the word uncertainty they said the benefits from r d are too uncertain because they're uncertain we're going to expense it think accounting right conservative the benefits are uncertain which is a very strange line to draw right because when you build a factory to make let's say a new kind of phone are your benefits guaranteed no it's all uncertain no it's always uncertain you can't use uncertainty as a dividing line it makes no sense so I said that makes no sense they said no no that's not the reason they're thinking on the spot thousand accountants haven't even thought about the reason for why they're expensing r d they said we want to be conservative we're accountants do you see how it's conservative right by expensing r d you're lowering earnings they're saying it's better to give you cons we can debate whether conservative is a good way of judging earnings I want reasonable I want most likely but conservative I get it but is it conservative when you expense something what are you showing about on your balance sheet nothing remember when you expense something it disappears of your balance sheet you know what accounting or what accounting rules are doing a technology firms and pharmaceutical companies they're taking your biggest assets off the books it's not showing up as assets it's not showing up in your book Equity you think so what remember how we computed returning equity and return invested Capital we use book equity and Book value of invested Capital if your biggest assets are not on the books guess what your return Equity is going to look like for a technology firm it's going to be 85 90 even if your projects are average projects you're going to report stupendously higher counting returns because your denominator doesn't reflect what you're investing in that's not conservative to me we cut to the chase there's no good reason for why accountants are doing what they're doing you're saying why aren't they fixing it remind me again how long it took them to fix leases as a prom 70 years so maybe in the year 20 you know 20 95 2089 they'll come around and do the right thing on our day I'm not waiting around for them so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to capitalize r d on my own and to capitalize r d I'm going to go through a three-step process I'm going to start by specifying what I call an amortizable life saying what's an amortizable life you're answering a question you're saying on average how long does it take between the time I do r d and a commercial product emerges from that r d let me repeat the question again on average how long does it take between the time I do r d and a commercial product emerges see why through the on average up front because I know some r d will not pay off some might pay off in two years some in five some in seven tell me on average how long it takes four years okay I'll take that I'm going to go back and collect r d expenses every year for the last four years if four years is your life and if I've been capitalizing r d i can't just start no I've got to act like I've been doing this through time so I'm going to go back to the r d four years ago and spread it out over four years so basically I'm taking your Rd expenses and spreading it out over your amortizable life sounds too abstract right so let's take an example say company called sap it's a German software company competes with Cisco in the in the it's a B2B company that's why you might not have heard of it it does r d I'm going to give it a five-year amortizable life I mean I I'm not going to finesse this I use amortizable lives between two years and 10 years I use 10 for Farmer companies why because of the approval process go through it's an incredibly long term software companies I use two to three years right you you turn things around much more quickly so sap because it makes computer hardware somewhere in the middle so I'll take five years I collected r d expenses for the last five years minus one minus two minus three minus four minus five of the last five years and the r d expense in the most recent so here's what I'll do I'll take the r d expense from five years ago remember I've been writing off one-fifth every year I write off the last one fifth this year there's nothing left over so I keep track of both what I'm writing off and what's left over r d from four years ago I write up one-fifth there's one-fifth left over r d from three years ago I write a one-fifth there's two fifths left over are different you know so basically each year I write off one-fifth I see what's left over trust me it's going somewhere you add up the last column you come up with the total value of 903 million dollars in the last column you're saying what is that going where is it going to show up and what is that if r d had been capitalized all all the way through I'd be amortizing it right the 903 million which is the sum of the last column will become the amortization you see in the income statement this year you see what about this 2.9 billion which is the second to last call that will now show up in my balance sheet as an asset that's the already expensive from previous years will also show up because balance sheets have to balance as an increase in Book value of equity so when I capitalize r d I'm going to come up with an amortization number I'm going to come up with an r d asset and I'm going to increase Book value by that ask final step I go back and clean up my operating income in what sense remember this year I'm subtracting out the 1020 million as my r d expense I'm going to take that r d and say I should never have subtracted that's not on operating expense and replace it with the 903 million which is the amortization expense this is the point that uq is Raising right now I'm getting a 1020 million dollar tax deduction for r d if r d were capitalized that tax deduction would be 903 million lower so from a tax perspective I'm worse off and if that's the reason you're capitalizing your expensing r d then I understand what you're doing just don't be too open about it because the tax guy is going to come after you so again let me look through again just like I did with leases I'm going to trace out how this changes the numbers and valuation and let's say in front of sap and they say well if you capitalize r d what will happen to us first your income which was 1.285 billion will jump to 1.359 billion you have higher operating income but because the tax guys are still allowing you to subtract r d expense as a tax deductible remember this is something I'm doing to you it's not the tax rules you're still going to get the entire 1020 as a tax deduction which means you get a tax benefit of 43 million that I'll miss if I capitalize r d and don't Factor it in so one simplistic way of thinking about it is your after tax operating income will increase by the difference between the r d expense and the amortization expense of 117 million so your earnings will be higher by 117 million dollars so you have higher earnings this is good right if I go to my balance sheet you will now have a book Equity that is higher than it was before in the case of sap their old book Equity was 3.768 billion I add the 2.914 Billet which comes from adding this column up and that sum of 6.782 billion will now meet my new book Equity I'll have higher book Equity higher earnings my capex if I trusted accountants it looked like I was reinvesting nothing in the statement of cash flow is 2 million but once I capitalize r d that number jumps to 119 million so my after tax operating income increases by 17 17 million my net capex increases by 117 million so if my income increases by 117 in my net capex my free cash flow of the firm remains exactly the same you see we went through this torture nothing's happening the free cash flow if your end game is Computing free cash with the firm capitalizing Rd does nothing to that free cash flow but here's where it makes a difference remember we talked about the return on invested Capital having to be higher than the cost of capital to make create value my old calculation for the return on Capital I used the book value of equity I saw on the balance sheet 3.768 billion with the 530 was the debt outstanding but the 3.768 was their old book Equity now that I've capitalized r d my book Equity jumped from 3.768 to 6.78 per billion my return invested Capital becomes much lower and that's going to have a huge impact on evaluation so why do we capitalize r d not because we want to get a better measure of the free cash flow last year but to get a better sense of how much is my company reinvesting and how well is it reinvesting two key questions in valuation you're going to answer better if you capitalize r d so let's review what are what accounting as it stands now is doing to companies which have a lot of r d and then let's review what will happen if you capitalize r d right now I think accounting as it exists is understating the earnings of technology companies and pharmaceutical companies Microsoft Apple and Salesforce are actually much more profitable than you think they are looking at the accounting statements you see why huge r d expenses that are being expensed right away you also are overstating the return and equity in these companies because their book Equity doesn't capture all those assets so you're understating net income and overstating overstating return and equity so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to go back and restate your income you'll be a higher income for most companies restate your book Equity including the r d capitalized and I think I'm going to get a much better sense of what kind of returns you're actually making on your projects than what I get by looking at the existing financial statements so r d meets these criteria being an operating Capital expense that's being treated as an operating expense right can you think of analogous expenses I think at the start of the class test last week we saw some of them right like an advertising company what should now be treated like r d capitalized some of the advertising expects that builds up branding is really for the long term we should be doing this a consulting firm the recruiting and training expenses we should be capitalizing do you see that this is a problem not just for pharmaceutical and technology companies it's a problem for about 70 percent of companies where expenses are being miscategorized and for an Uber or a door Dash that defines its value based on users as subscribers or Netflix you know what the equivalent of capex is right that customer acquisition cost that right now is being expensed I'm going to argue should be treated just like r d this is the opening wall in a much bigger issue that accounting faces of miscategorizing expenses so there are any questions on both the mechanics of what I do to capitalize r d as well as the intuition behind why I think we should do this for any firm with R D or R D like expenses okay built into your genital spreadsheet is an r d capitalization sheet if you decide to capitalize an expense use that sheet it'll do the cleaning up for you so everything I just described will happen in the spreadsheet automatically but don't make it a black box it's essentially going through a very simple set of steps go through the steps because that's not correct that's critical not just for you to use the spreadsheet better but also for the quiz and understanding exactly what happens mechanically when you capitalize an expense so we've talked about updating numbers we've talked about cleaning up after accounting let's move on to the third issue might run into some of you when you look at last year's numbers you'd see items which are called extraordinary items one-time items so let's talk about what to do about one-time items if they're truly one time and you'll see what I mean by truly one day let's assume you have a company that's reporting a loss of a half a billion let's say this is your company it's a money losing company but it's losing it because it had a one-time charge of a billion for a strike that happened last year or a lawsuit that got settled against the company for one-time loss in valuing the company this you need to base your number right if it's truly a one-time loss what should you do but it's all about the future it's truly one-time loss it's already happened the fact that you had a half a billion dollar loss last year was entirely because of this charge should probably not count the loss but you should actually take the loss out of the picture and if you do that your profits will become a plus half a billion your problem just went away so if you're one of those people who picked the money losing company and it turns out to be because of a one-time charge you just got lucky just take the item out and what you get as earnings will be the earnings that you use in evaluation you now have a money making company you can do everything that your teammates do but before you do that there's one thing you should check with s p Capital IQ which I think you now all should be able to access you could pull up numbers for the last 20 years and let's say here's what you see every five years you see a one-time charge of a half a billion that make you a little suspicious that every five years you get this one-time charge of a half a billion to make me suspicious because you know what it looks like you're doing you're taking a 200 million dollar every year charge you're lumping them up and taking a one-time charge and what do you get by doing this because it's shown as an extraordinary charge you can tell the world well we actually made money before extraordinary stuff this year so let's say that's the case that every five years you get a you know one billion dollar charge what should you report as you start I mean when it was a truly one-time charge I said take it up but if the once every five year charge then rather than take the whole thing out what should you take out If This Were normalized what would you have 200 million dollars is an expense every year right if they were doing the right thing so you know what I'd suggest replace the one billion dollar one-time charge with the 200 million dollar normalized chart saying you guys are playing games with me if minus your and if you do that you're minus 500 million loss will become a 300 million dollar profit because you're adding back 800 million that's then going to become your base here there's value looking across time for things like extraordinary charges if a company is extraordinary expenses that job year after year after year they're not extraordinary this is being called extraordinary treat them like operating expenses bring them into your analysis don't ignore them any questions on one-time stuff Jason looks like you have a question go ahead um I remembered like like with lease operations there's like some valuations to it and there could be like I think gains and losses on those depending on like like how do you how do you treat those yes what operations I'm sorry when you see these operations let me just yeah it was like this one line item in um the company that I was looking at maxing on that like it fluctuates like a lot every year does it go positive negative positive negative or is it always positive and negative a lot this can also happen the other item this can show up in the exchange rate effects can go positive negative when you have positive negative your life just got a little easier right because sometimes you make profits on this on exchange rates for instance when it moves in your direction you can report a profit when it moves against its losses just average over time um but I think it's like a VA it's like a revaluation of like that's fine right because that's again because it cuts in both directions that's why I asked you is it Paul if it's always negative then there's something systematic going on but to the extent that it cuts in both directions it's just an accounting see the minute accountants decided to capitalize things you know like branding and customer list this is a consequence of that right because when you capitalize things you got to go back and change the capitalized value if something fundamental changes so that can cut in both directions and because it cuts in both directions I would say you know what as long as accountants are not playing games it's going to average out to zero or average out to some number based across time so look at the average over time and see what it is and just put it in as an operating expense or an income this year and move on because there's nothing else you can do oh it's um the item is called um re-measurements loss and gain on physical delivery and Ford prepaid for get some accounting that they're doing it's it's it's it's only an accountant would name an item like that because to me it's completely uninformative as to what exactly they're doing so I'm just going to look at the number average over time and just use it okay but this is an interesting question we're at the mercy of accountants right they can play games on us and sometimes they can commit outright fraud if you read my adani group no this is what you know the Hindenburg is claiming a Danish Guru group is doing is that they that they're actually manipulating revenues and earnings and committing outright accounting fraud how do you know whether that your company is not committing outright fraud huh that's you know after the fact we always know but before the fact is there a weight no there might be have you heard of forensic accounting forensic accounting is about going through going through financial statements looking for clues that people are committing fraud I'll give you a few examples you know there's a income number in your income statement right there's also a cash earnings number that you can get from your statement of cash flows in other words you take the first part of the statement of cash flows which starts with net income and it's just for working capital you have an accrual net income and a cash net income and the numbers would be different some years the cash income will be higher some years the accrual income will be higher but let's say in your company the accrual income is always higher than your cash income which make you a little suspicious again it's not definitive but it's a clue or if you have a line item you don't even know what the line item is Jason just gave an example of a line item you really so what the heck is that but unlike Jason's line item this line item delivers bounty after bounty after Bounty three billion in income but you have no idea what it is you should make it a little suspicious where is this magical income showing up from sudden changes in accounting routes where you go from one way of adding inventory to another but you keep doing this year after year antenna should start quivering in the U.S you get 10ks but if you go and look at the SEC filings to your company it'll also see for some companies restated 10ks because when you restate your 10ks you have to refile with the SEC you think what's the big deal once in a while if your company has to do it so it's a big deal but if your company has to do restatement year after year after year hey you should start to say what's going on at this company and finally item one item that you need to keep your eye on is this deferred tax item I'm always suspicious about companies that report Big deferred tax assets or big swings and deferred tax liabilities because somebody's playing tax games on you none of these items individually is enough for you to conclude that your company is committing accounting fraud but collectively that's what Short Selling companies like Hindenburg and Citroen use to detect when companies are playing games if any of you are interested in forensic accounting I'll send you a couple of references in the email after class don't try to read them before the quiz you don't need them for the quiz this is for the rest of your life but they're actually kind of fun books to read because the next you will never read another financial statement the same way you did after you read these books because it'll set off all these red flags that you keep watching for and accomplishment I got that red flag maybe I should start worrying but accounting fraud is a real and present danger and you have to keep your eyes open as to what that fraud is doing which brings me to money losing companies and I'm going to give you a template for thinking about what to do if you have the money losing company to value the easiest scenario is the one-time loss right if your company lost money because it had a one-time lawsuit you're home free just add it back your problem's gone if your company had a loss because of a macro Factor or to be an example in 2020 oil companies all lost money you know why because oil prices dropped to thirty dollars a barrel in the middle of the covet crisis and oil prices drop even the the even companies like Exxon Mobil reported losses the fix there is rather than look at the most recently you might average out across the cycle right so 2020 they lost a lot of money 2022 they made record profits I'm not going to use either number I'm going to look at an average between 2017 and 22. so if you have a company a commodity company a cyclical company where it's a cycle that's causing your losses normalize average across time but let's look at the two cases which are more problematic if you're adding Peloton money losing company it's got a problem right it's problems are structural it can't figure out a business model that works and until it figures it out it's going to continue to lose money in which case you can't replace its losses with profits next year you've got to ease it into profits over the next five seven ten years it could also be an old a more mature company an older company which has structural problems that are fixable in which case you say if they can update their plant and equipment to make it more efficient they can do okay again you're looking at a long-term solution but be careful it's got to be a structural problem that is fixable right any of you valuing Bed Bath and Beyond let me ask you a question do you think Bed Bath and Beyond's problems are fixable but exactly would the fix be people are not coming to the stores because they just don't like the stores anymore your business model is broken the stores you're offering are like a throwback to 20 years ago I don't think Bed Bath Beyond problems are fixable in which case they ask me what will the future look like it's going to be more of the same it's going to be you're going you know it's it's the end game here is you're going to go towards bankruptcy because there's no fix so if you pick the money losing company where you look at the future and it looks Bleak your conclusion might be the equity in this company is worth nothing and I'm completely okay with you concluding that but you have to base it on a story and say it's not just because it's losing money but because I don't think that they can ever find a way to a profitable future so that's really the template I want you to think about when you think about losing money so when you see a company losing money ask yourself why is it losing money is it because of a one-time loss is it because of a macro factor is it because it's a young company working its way through the cycle or is it because it's an older company with a structural problem because that's going to give you the template and how to fix the problem and the Ginza Spreadsheet will work for all four of those companies it's a nice thing about that spreadsheet is it'll work for any type of company but you still have to make the choices that drive the value of your company go ahead Bernard I'm sorry a couple of us are sharing the zoom together um I had a quick question about money losing companies so if you're kind of working with a company where they have negative earnings um and they become slightly less negative due to an acquisition um but I guess that's like very inorganic growth um and and it's in a different space than what their original business proposition was in how would you kind of approach that in terms of understanding like margins well first the acquisition is done right yes so the margins today reflect the combined companies margins correct so you're starting with numbers that already reflect the fact that acquisition has been done the question now is what will the combined company look like if you feel the company that they've acquired is not just positive earnings but it's going to give them the potential to actually fix or grow at a rate that it fixes the other problem you can then you can you can actually when you do your projections have two projections one for the old business one for the business they're quiet so to add just two line items above revenues all business new business and if you're lucky maybe the new business will grow enough to give them positive margins which will drive the value of your company but it might make sense if the the business they acquired is very different from their old business you're a hotel company you're quite an Airbnb like company you might say look as a hotel business the end game looks awful but as this other business there's enough growth you can succeed so one suggestion I would have is maybe look at the two line items separately have different stories for each and different assumptions about growth and margins for each and then see if the Consolidated value is large enough to justify buying the shares today okay got it and I guess people don't have to worry about like organic versus allergenic growth in the sense that like takes care of itself right those are words that strategy people use in finance it doesn't matter right because what do we treat Acquisitions as capex the fact that one is organic one is inorganic is irrelevant what matters is what kind of return you're making those Investments so okay it doesn't really matter thank you so let's now talk about you've got the operating income so you got the earnings number nailed down a lot of work together but let's say you've never done you think now I need to multiply by one minus the tax rate remember when we did cost of debt we talked about a tax rate after tax cost for that the tax rate and that calculation is always a marginal tax rate because you say taxes at the margin when you borrow money interest expenses saves you tax in the margin but this is a different tax rate this is a tax rate you're going to apply on all of your income so I'm going to give you some choices on tax rates you tell me which of these tax rates you should use in your valuation and this is actually one of the inputs in FCF of Ginsu that I ask you about let's work out the intuition behind Which tax rate to use you could use an effective tax rate you could use the tax rate that you compute by taking taxes paid in the in the statement of cash flows divided by Ebbitt it's kind of low much lower than the effective tax rate you could use the marginal tax rate of the country in which the company operates you could use a weighted average marginal tax rate across all the countries it operates in because it could be in five ten countries maybe the answer is none of the above pretty nice if f for the answer unfortunately it's not that you can use any tax rate you want as long as use the same tax rate for your cost of debt and your cash flows that'd be nice right because if that were the answer if F were the answer what tax rate should use in valuation what's the easiest tax rate to work with a zero tax rate right if all you have to do is be consistent then you just act like there's no taxes so clearly f is not the answer so really the question is effective tax rate or marginal tax rate what could through intuitively as to what it will do to your valuation and remember also one of the classes I mentioned the average effective tax rate for U.S companies is about 16 17 18 the marginal tax rate is 25 percent so for most companies the effective tax rate is going to be much lower than the marginal tax rate so let's work it through if I use the marginal tax rate all the way through to get my after tax cash flows I'll be using a higher tax rate right and I'll end up with lower cash flows what am I missing in my valuation if I do that what am I implicitly assuming from this day on that you'll pay 25 of your income and taxes if you continue to pay only 16 percent of your income and taxes to the next five years I've understated your value because I missed the fact that you figured out ways to save on taxes so I don't want to go with the marginal tax rate all the way through because that's going to push me into doing some weird stuff could I use the effective tax rate of 16 percent I could but let's say I leave it at 16 forever what am I affect what am I assuming then I'm assuming that whatever the reason was for my tax rate being lower than my marginal tax rate will stay in place forever there are two reasons why your effective tax rate can be lower than a marginal tax rate for Apple the reason the effective tax rate is lower is because of income in other countries which have lower tax rates than the US that reason is never going to go away so in valuing apple I'm okay using a 16 effective tax rate in perpetuity but for other companies the effective tax rate is lower than marginal tax rate because they're very good tax lawyers who are deferring taxes the key word is deferring taxes what does deferring taxes mean that eventually they're going to catch up with you right if you have a company that's deferring taxes you can start with the 16 tax rate when you start the evaluation but as you go through time you're one year two year three year four year five and you approach your terminal year guess what should happen to your tax rate it should start to move towards your marginal tax rate so three scenarios one is a scenario where you see a company with an effective tax rate low the marginal tax rate but do you think the difference is coming from some permanent Factor usually foreign income leave it at the effective tax rate second scenario you have a company that's deferring taxes in which case you start with the effective tax rate and you move to the marginal tax rate over time because eventually it's going to catch up with you third scenario you say look the effective tax rate is there but it's jumping all over the place it's like Jason talked about his company I see companies with 16 27 23 percent you throw up your hands and say I'm just going to go with the modular tax rate that's why I give you that option in the FCF of Ginsu for you to pick it's not because I want to lead you down One path but because I want you to make the choice for your company that reflects what you've learned about your company any questions about taxes so in terms of the right tax rate you know if you use just the marginal tax rate for an undervalue company if you just use the effective tax rate forever you probably will overvalue companies that are deferring taxes so you want to split the difference don't take the average of the two start with and that's what the spreadsheet actually does is if you pick an effective tax rate of 16 and you leave the spreadsheet to do what it wants to do it'll take the 16 use it for five years and after five years move the 16 percent to the marginal tax rate so the default is I will do it for you but if you want to override the default I'll let you do that in the spreadsheet as well now let's do a little detour on money losing companies because you know you don't get a tax taxation but component in any of your classes right in your accounting do you deal with taxes at all other than to just talk about it as a side a side question no you don't really need to delve into taxation deep but when you lose money as a company we don't obviously don't have to pay taxes but in addition to not paying taxes what else are you allowed to do as a money losing company that loss you made this year is it just gone you're allowed to carry those losses go ahead I'm sorry Jake you're probably going to give the answer I'm going to let you give the answer I was gonna say that you can offset your future you can offset your future capital gains again it's called an nol or net operating loss so if you look at many of your companies that are money losing companies check the footnotes and the nice things about having PDFs rather than physical copies is use the search box type in nol net operating loss try different things who knows what accountants are using to describe it there they will tell you what accumulated losses they have from previous years so when I valued Uber in 2019 this is a company that made an art form of losing money year after year by the time they went public they had 1.5 billion dollars in nols carried forward think so what so I expected them to lose money in your one year two year four I was expecting them to make money but you know what they paid in taxes that year absolutely nothing why because they had this one and a half billion dollar loss with the losses over the next three years and in the spreadsheet here's what I do and the reason I keep going back to the spreadsheets for you to be aware of what I would do with their losses is I'll accumulate your losses and because I asked you for the nol in the spreadsheet as an input I will then when you start making money use those losses to protect you from having to pay taxes for one two three four years depending on how big the nol is so just to give you an understanding of how animals work I've taken a very simplistic example here let's say you have a company that is a billion dollars in NLS from previous years it's expected to have half a billion in operating income every year for the next three years it's turned the corner so I want you to you know and I've kept the numbers nice easy numbers to work with how much will this company have to pay in taxes in Year One it's got a billion dollar annual it's got a half a billion profit it'll pay no taxes right so you pay no taxes and your tax rate in year one will be zero percent you're too Gain No taxes because you still have a half a billion left over tax rate zero year three you're going to pay whatever your tax rate is 25 40 percent that's what I do when I do your cash flows is I keep track of the nol I use it to offset whatever you'd have owed in taxes otherwise and I save you in taxes allowing you to have higher cash flows because you got nanows Jason because for for companies operating in different regions for some of their uh reasons they are profiting so they're even though a company is like holistically losing in one business or one reason yeah you pay taxes as a corporation right so those companies don't have to carry things forward they will actually offset their losses against existing profits and pay a tax rate because you don't want to wait to get your tax savings if you can get it this year why wait two years so if a company has an option of offsetting current profits in some other region of the world or some other division against losses on a Division they will take it this year right okay I see so but for the company that I was looking at the the uh to come with the really weird line item um I I took through their 10K and there was this um there was a valuation allowance and they were intentionally marking down their valuation allowed significantly you know what the red flags are going off for me as you describe the things your companies are doing I'm clearly getting closer and closer the forensic accounting stages saying maybe we need to worry about but sometimes companies because of the way they've set up their subsidiaries might not be able to offset it so maybe it's a way they've structured it that a money losing subsidiary has to file taxes individually in which case you can have an nol that's carried forward but one subsidiary where another substitute is making money so it adds complications to your valuation because it means that you have a composite income I wouldn't worry too much of if that's the only issue then I wouldn't worry about it if there's something more more devious going on underneath then of course you know it it'll blow up somewhere in your valuation but keep tabs of these things because as you go through and you see these strange looking line items remember this is by Design right it doesn't happen accidentally and when you see things like this happen by Design you worry about opacity you worry about control you worry about who's running the company what their incentives might be I'm not saying that you know that this means your company is worth nothing I'm saying that it might mean once you value the company even if you find it slightly on the value you might hold off on pulling the trigger saying you know what I just don't trust these guys they play Too Many accounting games there's too much opacity in the income statement so file it away for the final decision part of the process because otherwise you can very easily get mired in some of these details talk about capex capex is the difference between capital expenditures and depreciation and all through this class I've emphasized that you know accounting words often don't mean the same thing when we talk about them in valuation but before we go into defining capex a couple of things remember one is what you're saying about net capex cannot be independent of what you're claiming about growth in other words if you want to give me a high growth story you have to reinvest to create that growth rate it's your story so your net capex assumptions have to be tied to your growth assumptions everybody agree that that's common sense severe manufacturing firm you tell me its revenues are going to quadruple over the next five years it's got to build capacity that's not going to magically happen and unless it is a huge amount of excess capacity now you will have to set aside the capex to cover that capacitor so your assumptions about net capex need to be tied to your assumptions about growth with that said my definition of capex is much more expansive than the accounting definition of capex you remember the accounting definition of capex is land building equipment machinery end of story I've already talked about what we do with r d we capitalize it because we want to treat it as part of net capex acquisitions organic inorganic some you know the question is asked about it to me there's no difference you can grow by taking projects internally you can call it organic or you can acquire other companies you can call it inorganic but it's all capex to me so in my story it all swims together in capex or a company growing through Acquisitions I'm going to count Acquisitions as part of capex that said though I hate value companies that grow primarily through Acquisitions because getting information on capex can be tricky if all of the capex takes a form of acquisitions because if you're acquiring another company what are the two ways you can acquire another company you can pay cash or you can use shares in other words you can issue shares in your company you can do an exchange offer if you pay cash and just got lucky valuing the company because it'll show up in your statement of cash flows as cash acquisitions but if you pay with cherished guess what it disappears into the footnotes you don't even realize this company spent six billion dollars on capex because they use shares to pay for it I I can't suggest an easy way around this but I'll give you an example of a company which I valued in the late 90s at the peak of its Glory is a company that grew to its Glory by doing acquisition Cisco it's a company That Grew From four billion dollars to 400 billion dollars over a 10-year period in market cap and it did it by acquiring company after company to 1999 at the peak of their Glory I actually valued Cisco remember that an acquisition-driven company so first I wanted a statement of cash flows see the first three lines it's called pooling that type of accounting is gone but the pooling accounting is when you pay for cash you have to do pooling so the first three Acquisitions were cash Acquisitions I found them in the statement of cash flows the rest I'm sorry the loss the purchase accounting is what I saw on the statement of cash flows but the pooling we're all paid for with share so the first three were all paid for with shares they weren't in the statement of cash flows the laws notice that the biggest acquisitions were all pooling Acquisitions they paid for with shares I had to go digging through the fit and footnotes to find those Acquisitions and once I brought them in it looked like Cisco spent 2.5 billion dollars on Acquisitions in 1999. when I did the net cap backs for Cisco I started with the accounting definition of capex and depreciation from the state of the cash flows and if I just stopped there it looked like Cisco was reinvesting nothing 98 million then I brought an r d i capitalized r d that added another one point now we're starting to talk real money another 1.1 billion and then I brought in acquisitions and you can see that Cisco in 99 was incredibly active in the act on the capex front they invested 3.7 billion dollars back from the company is this good or bad I'm not passing judgment yet I'm getting a much clearer sense of what this company is doing and what I'm seeing is a company that's aggressively trying to grow but my promise if I trusted the accountants that have completely missed it right because they'd have told me 94 million not a whole lot don't move on but the fact that they were doing it in an r d and Acquisitions meant that was happening under the radar so when you look at your company you will learn a great deal about your company and how it's growing if you start breaking out these these items and seeing where it's coming from and it'll help you tell a much better story when you value the company 30 questions on capex acquisitions r d go ahead okay so would you um under I guess like capex like if if it's we're talking about like a manufacturing company and they rely a lot on like say their like Workforce um would you count like plans I guess to like increase the workforce as like capex let me ask you a question if you're just going to hire more workers it's an operating expense you know why because things don't work out what do you do you fire them you just you're the hire workers on Five-Year contracts then it's a different story right because then it's going to become like capex because you now this effectively it's like borrowing money and acquiring an asset so it's not the increase of the workforce that matters it what kind of terms you've entered into I mean after all necessary the Saudi soccer team increased its Workforce by one by adding Ronaldo to its Workforce right but by doing it it probably doubled its debt overnight right yeah it was a huge capex so it really depends on the terms that you've entered into in the U.S for the most part it's an operating expense in Europe because of the rules on laying off people it might start with some kind of capex that you've got to worry about which is one reason many European companies hold off on hiring people even when they need new people because they have to think about what do I do things change thank you let's talk about working capital the accounting definition of working capital is current assets minus current liabilities right that's not the definition that we use in valuation I'll give you the valuation definition of what can happen it's the difference between non-cash current assets and non-debt current libraries let me repeat that again it's a difference in non-cash current assets and non-dead current libraries let me explain what I'm doing here start with the current libraries you look at the financial statements for a company and you look under current libraries you're going to see lots of items right inventory accounts receivable you're also going to see current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt I'm saying those two items take out of current libraries treat them as debt when you do cost to Capital and because you treat them as debt when you do cost of capital you shouldn't be counting them as part of working capital as well so what's left in current assets usually inventory receivables and accrued items accrued taxes accrued salaries those should stay part of current assets I'm sorry card libraries but when you talk about current assets there's always a cash hide and historically cash has been treated as a current asset accountants but I want to step back and think about why items like inventory and receivables Warriors as he run a small store you turn and look at your storeroom and it's filled to the roof with inventory you know why it should make you cringe what is the problem with having that much inventory Jake what's the problem with having a lot of inventory um like Peloton you have to sell it and if you don't sell it and as long as it's sitting in the store room what is it making for you absolutely nothing it's a wasting asset right you sell items on credit and you don't charge interest it's a wasting asset until you get it back you know now earlier on I said current liabilities I should have said accounts payable supplier credit would be what's left after you take our debt so on the asset side you take out cash you're going to receive be left with receivables and inventory but cash used to be a wasting asset 50 years ago you know until the early 70s even corporations with hundreds of millions of dollars in cash had to leave them in bank accounts earning some two percent rate on the market rate was seven percent or checking accounts with no interest on them amazing to think about but we have cash investment checking account it's a wasting asset right why is it wasting because while it's sitting in your checking account it does nothing for you if you take your money out of your checking account and put it into a money market account earning 3.58 roughly what money market accounts are making right now close to the table rate your cash is no longer a wasting asset it's earning a fair rate of return you see but it's owning only 3.58 if it's investment something liquid and riskless that's what it should earn in a long-winded way I'm saying cash is no longer a wasting asset at companies apple has a 150 billion in cash I promise you I guarantee you it's not sitting in a checking account somewhere it's invest in commercial paper and tables earning a fair rate of return a low rate of return but a fair rate of return cash is not a wasting asset so I'm going to take debt out of current libraries why because it's going to be treated as part of my cost of capital I'm going to take cash out of my current assets and what I'm left with is what I'm going to call a non-cash working capital so as you think about working capital in your company first and most of your companies it's a secondary issue right unless you have a retail firm or a firm heavily dependent working capital this is what's not going to drive you cash flow but for some of your companies it is a key item as you think about breaking things into detail remember what we said about detail earlier in the class unless you have some special powers at forecasting receivables for the next 30 Years inventory for the next 30 years payables for the next 30 Years don't go there just take the Consolidated non-cash working capital in fact I'd make it a percentage of revenues forecast the Consolidated number rather than individual line items second be ready if you look at the past to see this number swing all over the place so when you look at non-cash working capital in a year-to-ear basis it's one of the most volatile items in terms of changes on a year to year basis and there will be some companies but this number can be negative non-cash current assets can actually be less than current liabilities Amazon for the first decade of its existence had negative non-cash working capital you know what they were doing they were using supplier credit as a way to grow because the way Amazon worked early on was an online book retailer right so they would get books from a publisher say we'll pay you in three months you and I would get on the site we'd buy the books pay them immediately and they'd wait three months to pay them pay the suppliers so there are some businesses where working capitalists are being a source of cash can actually be a use of cash so be ready for that if that is the case in your company don't freak out it can happen it happens in about 25 of all companies it does mean that when you do valuation working capital is not a key item driving evaluation it's a secondary item but there's old factors to keep in mind we're getting towards the end here but I at least want to set the table for the last piece of the cash flow calculation precaster to the firm is a pre-dead cash flow free cash flow Equity is the cash flows to equity investors and for the longest time if I asked to estimate the free cash flow Equity we took the easy way out you know what I mean by the easy way out rather than estimating it we looked at what companies paid as dividends and said that's a free cash flow equity implicitly whenever you use the dividend discount model that's what you're assuming companies pay out what they can afford but we know beyond the shadow of a doubt that companies don't pay out what they can afford how do we know it because we can actually compute what a company can pay out as dividends because it's whatever cash is left over after every other need has been met you give me a statement of cash flows for a company I can tell you what the company could have paid out as dividends this year I'm going to call it free cash flow Equity but think of it as potential dividend cash left over after taxes after debt payments after Capital expenditures is a potential dividend for some companies what you pay as dividends would be less than the free cash rate Equity Google for instance pays no dividends it is significant free cash flow equity you use a dividend discount model for this company you can understate the value some banks pay out more than the free cash flow Equity if you use a dividend discount model you're going to overvalue the company so what I'm arguing for is you can try the dividend discount model which often we do for financial service companies but if you have a company we can estimate free cash flow equity for God's sakes don't go with the dividend discount model because you're trusting companies to do the right thing so let's talk about how to measure potential dividends I ask analysts this question I get the strangest answers some analysts say well it's earnings earnings are potential difference technically I could pay out my earnings as dividends but you know what happens if I pay my earnings out as dividends what kind of growth rate should I then be using in my valuation I take all my earnings paid out as dividends is zero growth rate if you're willing to do that I'm willing to go along earnings are not cash flows and I can't pay them out so earnings are not dividends I've seen ACT people actually discount earnings at companies and call them discounted cash flow models there's a horrendous mixes of I don't even know what and what you earnings are not potential dividends so I'm going to argue that potential Dividends are cash left in the till so the way I want you to think about it think like the owner of a small business what I'm trying to measure is how much cash is left in the till after you've met every conceivable need so let's see what you have you start with net income you add back depreciation right because depreciation is an expense but it's not you you pay out so think of yourself sitting there writing checks old-fashioned but think of it that way right so you've got net income you added back dividend that was your starting cash flow then you write a check out the capex a check out to working capital the checkout for acquisition so check out to the debt plan what you're left with after you've written all these checks out is your free cash flow equity so free cash rate Equity is a residual cash flow it's whatever's left over it's a cash flow you can pay out without damaging any of your prospects because by definition it's after you've met your reinvestment needs take a look at each of those those line items remember I said the statement of cash flows is where you should go every single item in that isn't your statement of cash flows net income is where every statement of cash flow starts with right if you go to the top of the the so don't use the income statement just go to the statement of cash flows capex and depreciation are both in the statement of cash flows changes in non-cash working capital be broken down into line items receivables payables in the statement of cash flows debt issuances in the financing section you see debt repaid debt taken every single line item there isn't the statement of cash flows so the free cash for Equity is basically the free cash flow Equity you can get from the statement of cash flows and I'd encourage you if you get a chance to pull up the statement of cash flows for your company even if you're not going to do a free cash flow Equity valuation this is a great exercise in understanding what drives dividends and potential dividends take the statement of cash flows and remember in the statement of cash flows each item will already give you the sign of the cash flow right so next to capex you'll see a minus right because it's a it's a cash outflow so all you have to do is just sum up all of those numbers because the cash flow signs will take care of is it a cash in Florida outflow see what the potential difference is now final question let's say you do this for your company if you come up with a free cash flow Equity could it be a negative number tell me what it can be in fact it's tell me what kinds of companies you're going to end up with a negative free cash flow equity on take a look at the calculation now first is any money losing company you're already starting in the whole you're probably going to end up with a negative free cash flow Equity right unless something uncommon happens but let's say you're a money making company what might make its free cash flow Equity negative you're doing a lot of Acquisitions a lot of capex relative to depreciation it's a growth growing company free cash flows Equity will be negative when you're in the growth phase of your life cycle it's a feature not about you know VCS call this cash burn they know that they they get all upset about this cash but in the company hey guess what that's what you should expect to see in a growing company because when you're reinvesting large amounts cash burn is exactly what you should say so when we start in the next class I'm going to start with a life cycle so you can see how free cash flows Equity evolve across the life cycle and we tried on Tesla to see how Tesla's free cash and Equity have evolved over time but it will help if you did this for your company so since this is part of preparation for your quiz anyway try this as part of with using the statement of cash flow to be good exercise not just for your project but for thinking about getting ready for the question so I will see you on Monday in class in person back in New York okay so no more zoom so no links on Monday so I hope to see you all in class have a good week and take care thank you bye-bye thank you thank you thank you Professor I had a question yes do you consider Disney acquisition intensive I'm not valuing Disney but I was just wondering 
foreign all right possible okay foreign okay folks quick reminder if you needed one that your quiz is day after tomorrow in the first 30 minutes of class in person I want to be specific some reason since covered people seem to assume that everything can be online no that's you know every it'll be in person I did send you three rooms because we look around you and this is not even the full room if everybody were in this room and we were all doing the quiz the stress level alone would blow the roof off so there'll be three rooms and I've assigned you to a room you have why do you look at me like I have two heads so you do do so you got that right so if you know make sure that you go to the right room otherwise we'll get overcrowding in the rooms so the first 30 minutes of class 3 30 to 4 so don't be late otherwise you'll miss a big chunk of the quiz it's open book open Notes you can keep your iPad open you can use your laptop but just to look at slides don't open Excel don't play around it's for your own protection that I'm going to keep you from using Excel no so it's uh 30 minute quiz so time is not your ally so don't sit there for the first 20 minutes pondering what to do scattered do I pick a problem get get going there will be office hours tomorrow from 5 PM to 7 P.M I sent you the link for those for the zoom office hours so I thought Zoom would be more flexible for that so you know if you're working from home you have questions accumulated I wanted to put it off as late as I could before the quiz because there's no point having office hours before you're ready so hopefully by then you can go through past quizzes see questions that come up repeatedly and see if any of them need to be answered any questions about the quiz before we start the first 10 or 15 the quiz is only through cash flows so which will be done with about 10 minutes but really the bulk of what you need is almost everything you need is already been done 15 minutes into this class we're going to start on growth rates which are not on the quiz so if you go back enough quizzes you'll notice that our growth rate questions in the quiz they won't be on this quiz because that was a different kind of quiz different material cover it will be only through cash flows so today as we as I said we're going to start talking about growth rates I want to ask a couple of questions about growth to get it started yep if you look at the past questions it's exactly the same format right there are no there are have you ever seen a multiple choice question in my question that's your answer right which which ports the website that was the 2020 online because when you took the quiz online you could not do it except so maybe that's a throwback in time so it will be free it will be open so make sure you show your work because you are getting credit not just for the final answer but how you got there so make sure you do show your work the reason I don't like multiple choice questions is you can't really get partial credit so this is actually far better than having four multiple choice questions trust me you can it's all or nothing there so this is basically show your work try to be neat because I'll be grading 350 quizzes and I will not be in a particularly good mood by the time I get to quiz 274 and you've scribbled on the side and the top and all over the place I'm not going to follow you all over the page looking for where your answer is so if you keep it neat it's actually to your benefit because then I can follow your work and said this is where she screwed up and he screwed up that's a half a point since we're losing two points because I have no idea where your work is show your work and if you want to have scratch paper on the side you really don't need that much everything should fit on the quiz itself so you don't bring need to bring any exam books or something it'll be four pages each prom will have its own page and you can use the back of the page if you screw up and you want to cross out what you did hopefully that doesn't happen now so there should be plenty of room to show your work any other questions on the question so let's uh let's start talking about growth I'm going to start with a question about growth that we tend to kind of think we know the answer to but we really underestimate people talk about the compounding effect of growth but let's see how good your compounding instincts are okay so don't operate in a pull out your calculator yet you can check your answer let's say you have and you can take the name of the company out LinkedIn is no longer the appropriate you have a company with revenues of 200 million let's assume you decide to give this company a growth rate of 30 percent a year every year for the next 10 years I want you to guess what your revenues will look like 10 years from now with a 30 growth rate just give me a gut instinct we talk about compounding will they lower will they be half a billion one billion two billion 3 billion or four billion how many of you think are going to end up at a half a billion if you let 20 nobody good okay how about a billion in fact if you did a rhythmatic growth it should be around a billion right what do you think it's going to be it's actually around three billion dollars try it out on your calculator okay 200 200 million growing at 30 years three Bill what if I double that growth rate the 30 I use 60 percent it was three billion with thirty percent so it'd be around 6 billion with sixty percent right it's more like 25 billion the reason I bring this up is often when you sit down to value a company and you like your company you want to put in a high growth rate right it's a 50 growth rate be careful because that growth rate will create really large numbers and you have to stop and ask is my company's market big enough that I can have a 20 billion dollar Revenue that's why I don't like to think in terms of growth rates I like to think in terms of end revenues so when you use that fcff simple ginson spreadsheet don't think of the growth rate look at the end revenues there is my company capable of delivering those revenues so that's one thing we'll talk about is growth rates and how they compart we'll also talk about where what what metric are you looking at when you look at growth see what are you talking about I could look at growth and revenues I can look at growth and operating income growth the net income growth in earnings per share which growth rate should you be using if you're doing a firm valuation you're very estimating free cash for the firm which of these growth rates would you need to use first you don't want net income or earnings per share because it's Equity numbers you know so when you look at revenues and operate income think of the conditions under which the two will grow at the same rate when would revenues and operating Come Grow in the same rate what's got to be true about margins margin has to be stable if your margin is stable projecting one will give you the other if margins are changing then you can keep moving up the income statement when you look at growth rates As you move down the income statement you're going to probably see growth rates be very different in fact when you look up growth rates for your company on Yahoo finance or in Blue Book the growth rates are usually getting a growth rate in earnings per share analysts don't protect growth and revenues a very very few project growth in operating income almost all of them project growth rate earnings per share so when you look at the evaluation and you want to use a growth rate and use that growth rate using an earnings per share growth rate where you should really be looking at Revenue growth or operating income growth foreign towards the end of today's session we're going to talk about what it is that ultimately drives growth and fundamentally if you think about what drives growth it's we know what are you putting back into the business so let's assume you have a business which is after tax operate income of 75 million on revenues of rebellion right it doesn't plan to reinvest any money and it'll maintain its existing assets and its existing return on Capital I've kind of given away the problem if you don't reinvest any money and you're going to maintain your existing return on Capital what's your growth rate going to be you maintain existing return on Capital your capital is not growing you're not reinvesting you're going to stop be stuck with a growth rate of zero put differently if you want to grow what do you need to do you either need to increase your investment Capital by reinvesting more or improve your return on Capital and today we're going to talk about both ways of thinking about growth it's a much healthier way to think about growth because it traces back growth to what you have to do as a business growth is not magical you and I don't have the power to go around endowing companies with high growth just because we like them says you think about your company again you're thinking about what kind of business is it and how it how does it run this business because that's going to give you an indication as to what kind of growth rate to use so I'm going to close up that and go back to who this person is with this now I know who that person is and I'd like to very much meet them one day now because it's always on Zoom hopefully on Wednesday he will be here for the exam I will I will I will talk to him directly we ended by talking about free cash Road Equity free cash flow Equity I said is net income minus reinvestment minus a plus whatever you get from cash flows or repay to to lenders or repeat lenders I want to hold on to that thought because I want to go back to a structure I introduced at the start of this class remember we talked about corporate life cycles I'm going to go through each stage in the life cycle and you tell me what you'd expect to see as free cash flow equity you have a startup or a very young company let's start the top what kind of net income are you going to see at a startup or a very young company probably a net loss right you're starting your business what kind of reinvestment are you going to see at a very young company lots of reinvestment because you're hoping to grow so you have negative net income lots of reinvestment and generally they can't afford to borrow money there's no cash flows from debt you're going to have negative free cash flow that equity BC is called this cash burn it's a feature of young companies is you have cash per so let's say this company's business model starts to get traction its losses start to become profits but it's still a high Growth Company it still has a huge reinvestment need and that reinvestment is going to be far greater than that small net profit you're still going to have negative free cash flow Equity so as you're a Growth Company lots of promise your net income might turn positive but your free cash flows to equity will still be negative you keep moving your business model not only has traction it starts to generate profits and your growth starts to level off keyword is level off so what does it bring you as a bonus if your growth starts level off you're disappointed but you also don't have to reinvest as much so your profitability improves your reinvestment drops off and you might even be able to tap into debt for the first time right some of you read investment control from debt your free cash rate Equity now has a chance of turning positive and then you become a mature company you now have very little growth you don't have to reinvest much your existing business are throwing off profits like crazy you can have huge cash flows this is peak-free cashword equity territory and then you're going to decline and your free cash flow Equity start to decline as well but if you look at the pathway of net income and free cashword Equity net income turns positive before free cash flow Equity it Peaks before free cash flow Equity does and then in the last stages it'll actually fall below your free cash rate Equity as you liquidate yourself as a company sounds like an abstraction but I thought I'd try this out on Tesla the first time I valued Tesla was in 2013. young startup big money loser so what you would see in this graph is actually my net income and free cash flow equity for Tesla every year from 2006 the year of the founding all the way through 2021. so the green Co the green column is your net income or loss and you can see it's a net loss net loss in fact until 2019 Tesla had never made money but in those years look at the free cash flow Equity while you have a net loss it's a free cash flow Equity is even more negative which makes sense right you have a net loss you've got a reinvestment you got negative free cash flow equity in 2020 the net income turned positive for the first time you're saying what happened to the free cash flow Equity seems to have disappeared it actually was very close to zero but remember the net income turned positive free cash flow Equity did finally in 2020 in 2021 you can see net income is positive but free cash flow Equity is still lower than net income because it's still a growing company if I track these two over time if you are an upbeat investor and Tesla what do you expect to see these numbers look like for the next decade first net income will have to continue to increase right free cash or Equity will stay below the net income if they're going to grow but it'll start catching up in fact one sign that Tesla has matured as a company is when free cash Road Equity finally catches up or gets close to net income that might happen when the growth rate gets one to two percent you don't want that to happen as an investor but think of that as a steady state here one of the indicators I use to detect where a company is in a life cycle is I look at their net income and I look at the free cash flow equity if the net income is running way ahead of the free cash rate equities much higher I think of it as more in its growth phase whether it's good growth or bad growth I still have to make a judgment if the numbers are starting to catch up it's towards its mature phase and the free cash rate Equity starts to get higher than the net income your company's starting to actively shrink it's becoming a smaller company so when you think about net free cash flow Equity factor that now this table in your notes is uh is incorrect so I had to replace it it's not incorrect but I wanted to replace it with a table that I think better tells the story so this table here's what I've done I took all publicly traded companies in 2022 I got their aggregated net income across all companies the aggregated free cash flow Equity across all companies so think of this as potential dividends China actually had negative free cash flows equity 2022. potentially Chinese companies should be paying dividends in the aggregate but think of 2022 maybe there was an aberration then you have dividends and BuyBacks and I looked at the percentage of cash flows within each part of the world that come from BuyBacks notice the outlier the U.S now 65 of all cash returned to shareholders takes a form of BuyBacks that's why the dividend discount model no longer works in the U.S you're focusing on a small slice of the cash flows but it's not just the US you're starting to see this number rise across the world more and more companies are shifting away from dividends to BuyBacks so when we talk about cash return to shareholders we need to talk about BuyBacks as part of the process or missing a big chunk of those cash flows one final number and this I think is potentially troubling especially if you think about the US economy take a look at the cash flows returned cash return to shareholders dividends plus BuyBacks 1.5 trillion take a look at the free cash flow equity 232 billion remember I said you can tell where a company is in the life cycle by looking at net income versus free cash flow equity in a sense in countries where you start to see growth start to become close to zero or negative you'll start to see the cash return to investors start to exceed potential dividends you're seeing that in the U.S and it's not just now it's been going on for quite a while so any questions on free cash flow equity there's one final point in free cash flow Equity just to mop up if you have a company which has decided on a fixed debt ratio in other words they tell you from this point on 20 of all our reinvestment needs are going to come from dead 80 per equity and lots of companies have Target debt ratios there's a shortcut you can use to get to free cash flow equity so rather than go through that six lines that you saw before here's what I'm going to do I'm going to start with net income like I did before then I'm going to look at the equity portion of net capex in other words instead of counting the entire net cap access reinvestment I'm going to count only the 80 that comes from me as an equity investor and count only the portion of the 80 that comes from me for working capital I have a shortcut to free cash rate Equity the reason this works is I'm implicitly assuming that any debt that gets repaid will get repaid with new debt that's raised and that new debt will be taken on as I grow as a company it keeps my debt ratio stable so when you think about free cash to record again remember it's a post debt cash flow and how much you borrow can affect that free cash flow equity which opens a door to one way in which you can increase the free cash flow equity and companies often walk through the store thinking this is a free lunch so I'll illustrate this with a very simple example long time ago I computed the free cash flow equity for Disney so in 1997 the net income was 1.4533 Billet the debt ratio was about 24 so 76 percent of whatever they reinvested came from equity and they seem to have settled into that so let's say I computed a free cash rate Equity there's my net income I subtract out 76 of net capex and 76 percent of change in working capital I end up with a free cash load Equity of 704 million that year they paid out 345 million dividends showing that they're held back on cash I'm going to play a little game here and you tell me what I miss it the debt ratio that you see of 24 let's say I made it 30 or 40 to 50 as I raise the debt ratio what's going to happen to my free cash flow equity so that ratio goes from 24 to 40 remember net income is still my net income it's still there but now I'm going to get only 60 has to come from Equity so the more I raised from debt the less I need to reinvest as Equity investors I have more cash flows left over myself right there's the free lunch looks like if I just raise my debt ratio my free cash flow Equity goes up as my debt ratio goes up this seems like every lbo guy's dream right you go borrow money your free cash flow Equity shoots through the roof at least on a per share basis what can go wrong this is the value of equity the present value of free cash flows equities of a higher free cash flow Equity doesn't this mean My Equity should be worth more what do I discount the free cash flow to equity at what's the discount rate I use by now you should have done enough review on the quiz get that right should I use the cost of equity or cost of capital cost of equity because it's free cash to equity and what's a key number that determines how high or how low the cost of equity is it's not the risk created the equity risk screen they have nothing to do with my company it's my bail right and what beta do I use leopard beta or non-level beta I love it Beta And as I borrow more money and I make my free cash flows Equity higher what's happening to my level beta there's my cost of equity as my debt ratio goes up so as I borrow money I will have more free cash with Equity because I have to reinvest less as an equity investor but I'll also face more risk as an equity investor I left a higher cost of equity so which effect do you think will dominate the cash flows are going up the discount rate is also going up let me give you the choice and you tell me which of these choices would best describe what will happen to this company if it borrows more the first is that increasing leverage will increase value because the cash flow effects will always dominate the discard rate effects think through that if that is true then what should happen every company should be at 99 there the second is increasing leverage will decrease value because the discount rate effects will always dominate the cash flow of X in which case if that's true nobody should borrow money maybe increasing leverage will not affect value because the risk effects will be exactly offset by the cash flow effects does that sound mildly familiar remember in your corporate finance class you talked about Miller Modigliani you don't remember them right you probably had it in passing but somebody remind me what is the millimeter clear any theorem set it doesn't matter right word it's c that will apply whatever you gain my increasing leverage and don't dismiss it too quickly there are some companies where leverages in fact a neutral Factor changing it will not affect value and there's a fourth statement which is increasing leverage can increase value for some firms and decrease value for others I fall on D and in fact you know I put up my latest data update on debt if you get a chance review it because it's a good review of your debt sessions from from corporate finance of how that plays out in value because too often in practice people look at one side of the equation so people who look at only the cash flow or the return Equity side those private Equity investors tend to borrow way too much because they're not factoring in the risk but there are other conservative companies that look at only the downside of that they factor in the risk it brings and they don't factor in the cash flow effect and the return Equity effect it's a trade-off I'm not trying to convince companies to borrow more but borrow less but they need to think about the trade-off in terms of will increasing the debt ratio of my company actually increase its value but it's Equity investors any questions so let's talk about growth I'm going to set the table for growth by first arguing against the notion that growth is always a good thing right now how deeply entrenched that is I mean whenever you heard the CNBC analyst get on and say I really like this company because it has low growth or negative growth right so at least if you listen to these people they always seem to think higher growth is better than lower growth and lower growth is better than negative growth that's not true growth is a double-edged sword the good side of growth is it makes your revenues grow it makes your income grow that's a good sign the bad side of growth is you got to reinvest to get that growth right you got to put aside money it goes into capex and working capital reduces your cash flows weather growth is good or bad will depend on whether the good side overwhelms the bad side and we use a very simple metric and we'll come back to this if you can earn a return in capital over the long term that exceeds your cost of capital you're going to create value from growth if you're in roughly your cost of capital you're running in place with growth it's not adding or destroying value and if you earn less than your cost of capital you're actually destroying value as you grow that's going to become the basis for this entire session on growth is to talk about good growth as opposed to bad growth rather than say any growth is good therefore I'm going to go out and grow as a company so let's look at the ways in which you can estimate growth for your company by now I hope you've already picked a company I'm not going to nag you anymore I've stopped looking at your master list obviously you're never going to fill in the name of your company until I start saying five points for putting the name of your company in you're probably waiting for that point to come and who comes you know because I need the names eventually but let's say you're sitting down trying to think about hey I want to estimate growth from my company how do I do it let's set up the three ways in which people try to estimate growth in the early three everything you do has to go through one of these three Pathways one as You Look Backwards right you look at the past you say how fast is my company grown last three years last five years last ten years it's called historical growth it's natural that's where we start the second is we Outsource you know what I mean by Outsource let me see if somebody's told me what growth rate to use for IBM what growth rate do you use for medic takes the weight off your shoulders it's not that their growth rate is better but now you can blame them if something goes wrong and in the context of valuation there's actually a group out there that you think of as experts equity research analysts that's all they do they track these companies they've given me a growth rate I'm going to use that growth rate so the second approach to estimating growth is you look at analysts you look at managers you try to get growth rates from them and say they must know more than I do therefore I'm going to use that growth rate so you can look at the past you can look at where other people are forecasting or you can start with the business that's at the company itself and say I'm going to look at how well my companies run what it reinvest and how well it reinvests and if you can answer those two questions how much it reinvest and how well it reinvests I'm going to give you a very simple mechanism for coming up with growth for your company it's called the sustainable of fundamental growth so let's start with historical growth the conventional wisdom often is you know said the speaking language to English I thought I was speaking in English but I guess I wasn't right um no the conventional view of historical growth is that you know you're looking at the past you're going to come up with the growth rate so I'm going to start by looking at historical growth rates and why they're not as clean clear-cut as they look from the outside so when you try to estimate the historical growth for your company here are some of the choices you'll have to make first is are you going to compute an arithmetic average or a geometric average part of he's already saying who really cares you're going to be amazed at how big the difference is when you look at growth on an arithmetic average basis or when you look at a compounded average in some cases I've seen people even bring in statistical tools like regressions Overkill in my in my view to try to estimate growth so there's a the mechanics of how your estimating growth second it the the growth rate you get for your company can very much be a function the period you look at for your company I'll give you a very simple trick you can use to make the growth rate for your company look high pick a really bad year as your base here take a hotel company you make 2020 as a space here it's going to have 250 Revenue growth since then why because all the hotels were closed it's also going to depend on the metric you used to estimate the growth is it revenues it operating income is it net income is it earnings but you can get very different numbers so growth rates you get can depend on the method you use to compute the growth rate the time period and the metric you use and in some cases you're going to hit a brick wall and not even be able to estimate a growth rate you see why would I you know with revenues you can always estimate a growth rate but let's say you're looking at growth in earnings per share and let's say you had minus a dollar as you're earnings per share last year and plus the dollar this year first was this a better year than last year let's start with the easy question you went from minus to plus that's good right minus to plus is good but then when I asked you what growth rate did you have this year think about it how do you come up with a growth rate and you go from minus to Plus we're going to look at tricks people play but they're tricks they're not really dealing with a fundamental problem and I'm also going to talk about the compounding effect what happens if you're not careful about taking past growth rates and projecting them out to the Future so let's start with the first question arithmetic versus geometric averages how much does it really matter so this is a company called Motorola Semiconductor Company late 90s I estimated the growth rate in revenues ebitda inhabit so basically I turned it took six years of numbers and the first where estimated growth was an arithmetic average what's an arithmetic average you compute the growth rate every year and you take the simple average of the growth rates so the arithmetic average growth rate in revenues over the five years is 7.08 the geometric average when you take the starting number and the ending number and you look at the growth rate between those two is six point eight two percent missing so they're pretty close and revenues they are pretty close we look at arithmetic and geometry Capital just the arithmetic average is 10.9 the geometric average is 5.39 percent adapt if you look at Abbott the arithmetic average is 42.4 percent the geometric average is four percent notice the arithmetic and the geometric averages are diverging as I move down the income statement this is almost always going to be true and here's why they're diverging remember the two arithmetic and geometric averages will converge only one condition is met which is the growth rate is the same every year in other words if there's no there's no standard deviation in the growth rate your arithmetic and geometric averages will be the same the greater the standard deviation of the growth is the more volatile growth rates are in a year to year basis the bigger the difference As you move up the income statement growth rates become more stable revenues don't go 500 percent minus 100 per earnings get that's why arithmetic and geometric averages tend to be closer for revenues and much more Divergent when you look at net income it gets worse with earnings per share so if you're saying you know which one should I use a geometric average is a much more realistic estimate of growth I don't even know why we computed arithmetic averages still but geometric apertures are much much more realistic because you're talking about growth and earnings over time a compounded average better captures that any questions on arithmetic versus geometric averages now let's take that scenario where you go from negative to positive and talk about what does that tell us let's say you're looking at Time Warner in 1997. in 1996 they had negative earnings per share minus five cents in 1997 the earnings per share went to 25 cents I just put into my Excel and said compute the percentage change here's what it did took the change from last year to this year which is 30 cents and divided by earnings per share last year I got a minus 600 percent growth rate of course does the sign even make sense I went from negative to positive it was a good year right but look at the growth rates it's terribly a minus six hundred percent this thing I can fix that let me make the minus into a plus I can do that and some people do that they use the absolute value of the earnings the denominator neat little trick but it's kind of meaningless the second is what's giving you the negative number here the the denominator is negative right this is the second wave mathematically you fix it rather than divide by last year's earnings per share you divide by the higher of the two numbers what a neat little trick now you've gone from minus six hundred percent to plus one twenty percent because the denominator will now be 25 cents my bottom line though is none of these numbers really make sense in terms of forecasting future earnings per share if you have earnings going from negative to positive you cannot estimate a growth rate might as well just say there is no historical growth rate I could use I can see trend lines I'm moving from negative to positive that's good but kind of move on so the Assumption you can always get a past growth rate is not true especially when you have numbers that go from negative to positive positive to negative because growth rates can't work with sign changes that well so as I said you could play all kinds of tricks with negative earnings and one trick is use the absolute value use the higher the two values none of these numbers though have any meaning any resonance in terms of forecasting future growth so my suggestion is start with your with your history see if you can compute growth rates and revenues operating income net income you might never use them and at least be aware of what's my company growing at because it's the starting point the platform from which you're going to tell the story about future growth rates one final point about historic growth be very careful though even if you feel sure about past growth in extrapolating that growth into the future go to Callaway golf what is the most famous product what is the product that put them on the map a go you you say sorry no pre before the golf ball they had a golf club called the Big Bertha that was a that was their claim to Flame the big bird that was what launched them into it now of course they have the golf ball business right so this was a company that came out of nowhere and created a golf club but the the advantage of golf is everybody thinks that they had a better Golf Club they would be Tiger Woods right this is this is how you sell people on it so you know they sold the golf club then they succeeded this was in 1997 the company in class they had 122 million in in net income up from 1.8 million five years before so the compounded growth rate over that five-year period was 102 percent geometric average growth so let's say 97 I look at the last five years this is a great company it's got a 102 growth rate I'm going to project 102 growth rate for the next five years see what happens basically if my story comes true we'd all have to buy big berthas and put them in our closets even though we don't play golf because I'm giving the company 4.1 billion dollars in net profit by the time I get to five years out 122 million growing at 102 percent a year is essentially going to explore that very very quickly into numbers you cannot sustain if those of you value young companies especially companies with this history of really high growth rates be careful about not taking the last five years of growth which might be 70 extrapolating on a much bigger base now for the next five years because your company might not this is like the example we started the class with be careful about extrapolating past growth even if you think it's a reliable number into the future because scaling up is hard to do is that a song I think is breaking up is hard to do but somebody should sing a song scaling and they should play it out loud in every equity research you know office in the world because analysts constantly assume growth rate that you cannot assume as a company scales up so now let's talk about using Outsiders estimates you know the most common source for growth rates is for appraisers of private companies does anybody know how do appraisers of private companies come up with growth rates for their companies they ask the managers of the company what to use as a growth rate and the logic is impeccable they say the managers know more about the company than I do so I'm going to trust their growth rates and it's true they do know more but they have a problem they're biased right they have a story to tell and they're going to give you a high growth rate they're not lying they're just delusional enough to believe their own stories but lots of appraisers we ask them where do your numbers come from they use management growth rates and in public companies you know you ask people where do you get the growth rate for your company their answer is they got it from equity research address because that information is actually public information you can get estimated growth for the next five years for your company you go on Yahoo finance you can look up that growth rate you go on Capital IQ you can look up that growth rate so you can look up the growth rate for your company you know earnings per share for the next five years even in revenues for the next two years and here's the logic that leads people to trust those analysts forecasts remember I talked about sell side and by side and sales ad analyst the analysts that you see at investment Banks who track 15 or 20 companies to the rest of their lives buys that address work at Fidelity or you know T row price and they track a much bigger set of companies they move across sectors but sales ad analysts dedicate their life to a sector so you picked a company in that sector the value your reaction is they do this all their lives they just track these companies they must know more than I do and a significant portion of every analyst time is forecasting earnings per share so their forecast of earnings per share must be much better than the forecast the rest of us make because of how much time and resources they bring to the game so I'm going to start with that we're going to look at earnings forecast from analysts and how much better they are than the rest of us because they bring in all this additional ammunition to the game so there have been several studies that look at our analyst forecasts relative to time series margin time series margin just take fast data and extrapolate a computer is going to do it it's not even chat GPT this is pre-chat jpt you basically take time series data you project out there Handler should be able to beat that hands down right they have all of that data plus access to management they spend all their time doing research they talk to all kinds of experts so these studies look at whether analysts forecasts be time series models a very minimal test and I'll give you the good news first if you look at one quarter ahead forecast which is next quarter's earnings analysts are better than time series models small blessing but not by much the way to think about this is if you're perfect if you get perfect forecast you get a very low your numbers are so if your forecast is always exactly you should get a standard error of zero none of them have standard deviation of zero in fact analyst forecasts are slightly better than the forecast from time series models if you look at one quarter ahead forecast if you go to two quarter head forecasts even that mild Advantage seems to disappear by the time you get to five year or one year there's really no difference between just using the past data and using an analyst forecast this is kind of a incredible waste of resources right we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars these equity research analysts turn out reports and their primary focus which is forecasting earnings per share Beyond one quarter ahead they don't seem to do that good a job it's been a mystery what is it that's happening why can't why aren't they bad so to answer that question I'm going to focus in on a subset because you know you present this evidence and I have to equity research analyst conference they all look at each other and say well that's not us it's the guys outside the room we're much better forecasters you're focusing on all analysts and a lot of crappy analysts none of them are at this conference if you focus on the very best equity research analyst you'd get much better answers so there are studies that do that you know that there is a just like in football there's an All-America team there's an All-America team of equity research analysts institutional investors been picking these analysts now for maybe 40 years so every they go into each group Energy Group they pick the All-America analysts for this year is so and so from Goldman Sachs so and so for Morgan certainly if you're an equity research analyst this is the Pinnacle of your life the minute you become an All-America analyst this now becomes part of your name you don't you're no longer Joe Brown equity research analyst you're Joe Brown All-America equity research that's how you introduce yourself to your spouse to your children you say from now on call me all America because I'm an All-American because it increases your income by millions of dollars once you become an All-American so these are the very best of the animals right so there are studies that look at these All-America and listen they ask a very simple question that's actually two very simple questions one is are these guys much better than everybody else is that why they became All-America Atlas and second are all America analysts forecasts better than the forecasts of this this unwashed hood that that four thousands and the answer is actually very surprising you know that in the year before these analysts become All-American analysts their forecasts are actually a little worse than the forecast of average hours since become all-americanalysts it's not because they're forecasting accuracy it must be something else no All American analysts are based on votes from people so if I give you 15 analysts and these are all people in the finance and you get to pick a name you're going to pick based on who you see on CNBC or who you see so the more visible you're as an equity research analyst the more likely it is that even if you're a terrible analyst if you get quoted all the time so the you're coming in they're actually a little worse at forecasting than the typical animals then something magical happens they get picked as All-America analysts the year after they magically become a little better at forecasting earnings than everybody else in the game everything happens self-esteem Rises and they become better forecasters what do you think happens when you become an All-America analyst that makes you a better forecaster of earnings than the typical energy because confirm so tell me how this plays out in practice when you say confirmation by I'm actually looking at the learning forecast their actual earnings are getting more accurate right so that isn't just a subjective judgment they're actually getting better at forecasting earnings after the choice so it can't just be confirmation bias where I just look at the name all American analysts their forecast must be better they're actually getting better in terms of being closer to actual earnings yes foreign it's not even that's a that's a different issue which is the price effect you have goes up that effect you can explain by the fact if you're all American analysts Wall Street Journal picks you up more often you get a bigger effect but the earnings forecast itself remember I said your name now becomes Joe Brown All-America analyst so let's say they play the role of an equity research analyst remember you're not supposed to get information from The Firm directly the SEC is actually very tight on what kind of information a company can reveal to analysts but you get little smidges of information little rumors so your Joe Brown just equity research and as you call the company they blow you off there's so many analysts calling who cares your Joe Brown All-America analysts CEO comes on the phone say I can't give you specific but inventories are running low read into it whatever you want your access to information magically becomes better when you become an All-American analyst it's a fact that people think that you can be the conduit for revealing this information to the market and it is true and the point made about the price effect of your recommendations becomes much greater when you become an All-America analyst but here again there's a disparity between by recommendations and cell recommendations my recommendations when all American Idols put them cost the price to go up but the price increase disappears very quickly in other words it seems to be all liquidity people coming in but sell recommendations when they come out not only have a much bigger impact on the price they have a much more lasting impact on the price it's kind of weird right by recommendations don't leave any Lasting Impressions but cell recommendations do why do you think that is the keys that the word used or stinky stinking okay but both Drive actions right buy people buy people not sell people sell so I'm not sure stickiness alone explains it first remember the numbers I gave you for buy versus sell it used to be 20 to 1. it's now nine to one so first is cell recommendations array the very fact that there's a cell recommendation indicates that there must be something freaking you out so the first is that it's unusual to get a cell recommendation second remember you're burning your Bridges with cell recommendations so the fact that you put out a cell recommendation must indicate that you feel so strongly that you're willing to put the cell recommendation so buy recommendations come out they have a price impact the price impact disappears cell recommendations come out they stick and you see the prices stay lower so I wrestle with us too many people from evaluation classes have ended up as sells at equity research actress I try to talk them out of it I never quite succeed and some of you will end up at Southside equity research analyst but no so this is for you when you get out there sells at equity research analyst in terms of what you might be able to do to fix because there's a problem right we're spending millions of dollars in sales at equity research but it's not credible nobody really cares what it is and it doesn't seem to be having any impact on that so I took a closer look at why Southside equity research is in the trouble that's in and as as I see it there are pretty much you know five problems that I can isolate first is tunnel vision the nature of cells had equity research as I described it is you're put in a sector and has to look at 15 companies and act like the rest of the world is not there that's not healthy nobody in Market should be looking at an individual sector and forgetting the rest of the world because then when everything in your sector gets trading trading at 50 times revenues you don't think it's unusual everybody pays 50 times revenues what's a big deal here the tunnel vision what's the solution to that what do we need sales at equity research analyst to then we need to actually rotate them right move them across sectors I know you're going to give up some expertise when you do it but this notion of staying sector focus is I think getting in the way of good equity research second is there's a whole lot of lemongitis in cells at equitaries you know one of the things you notice with the Southside equity research analyst is they'll revise earnings estimates upward if they think positive you see one num so in the Wall Street Journal keep your eye on an earnings revision that's outputed you get a whole host of earnings revision support in the next three or four days as other equity research analysts rush to join third there's a version of what I call the Stockholm syndrome you're the Stockholm syndrome Stockholm syndrome was I think concocted in by some psychiatrist in the 1970s when they noticed that people who were getting kidnapped after a while started identifying with uh hostages we're identifying with the hostage takers rather than the people trying to rescue them it's a Stockholm you're saying what's that got to do with equity research if you think about equity research at its core what are you supposed to do you're supposed to ask deep questions of companies and be a objective assessor of what a company is worth here at some point though equity research analysts seem to forget that they're supposed to look at companies as objective Outsiders they become insiders they become Defenders the company why because they play too much golf with the CEO they get to know the manage I mean let's face it if you get really really friendly with the top management company it's very difficult for you to be objective you're one of them there's a lot of factophobia and equity research a lot of tables but the numbers never get used to any productive years a lot of Storytelling without an anchor in numbers and finally and this is less of a problem than it used to be in the U.S in many investment Banks sells out equity research the U.S almost every Investment Bank sells that equity research is not a it's not a revenue Center you don't charge for your research you give it away for free so why do you do it because you expect other business to go through the Investment Bank which means you got to constantly think about if I put out the cell recommendation the company what will the rest of the Investment Bank think of me will I get a call from the CEO or a managing director saying come in and talk to me because this is a company we're going to take public in six months okay in fact last week I was in my in my room doing a session for Google's Google managers and I have a Google Wi-Fi so I kept saying the word Google and she would keep piping in saying you know I can't quite understand what you're at I'm not asking you anything just shut the heck up right so the problem with I'm I I'm Siri on my phone I have Alexa at home and I have Google in my office at home so I called them by the wrong name they'd never answered so I asked Google to do something calling it Alexa no response called Alexa Google no response one of these days I'll get the names right but I think Southside equity research is in trouble it needs to be reformed to be fixed so if any of you going to sell that equity research this is a long fight to be fought initially going to be put in a sector you'll be asked to follow 15 or 20 companies try not to develop tunnel vision keep your perspectives open look at the rest of the market be aware of what's going on and you will feel pressure from if you work at Investment Bank because it'll be other business the investment bank has you can't fight it alone you got to figure out some kind of mechanism that you can be at least reasonably objective even though there's pressure on you not to be so okay yes you're following the entire sector you won't have a job tomorrow if you put a cell recommendation entire this is your entire sector right so if you say sell everything remember most of your clients are long only clients right I mean unless you have a lot of hedge funds as clients you could if you're not a sales at Equity so then you'd have to be a macro analyst there are sector analysts whose job it is and that there it's easy you can say buy the sector sell this sector so there are there's research at the sector level or even at the market level you can sell entire geographies you know sell all Indian stocks buy Chinese stocks but at the individual Southside equity research level it's very difficult to put a cell recommendation so I'll I I'll complete this section by stating three propositions about analyst growth first is if you think analysts have access to some private information that you don't have Let It Go the U.S they really don't know much more than you do you have Capital IQ they have Capital like you you read the earnings report they read the earnings report you want to sit on an onyx release you can sit in an earnings release just like they can the investment world has become a lot flatter over the last four years they don't have information you don't in other markets it might be different there are some Emerging Markets where equity research analysts have access to private information inside information that you and I don't but in the U.S there's far less private information when there is private information remember it's coming from One Source it's coming from the company you think so what it's true company information is based on more basis they know more about the company but company information is by its very nature biased it also explains why some analysts like all America analysts have an advantage over others why if you work at Goldman Sachs you might have an advantage of somebody who works at Jeffries because companies think that if they really release the information to Goldman Sachs analyst you get a bigger mark and finally there is value to knowing what other people are forecasting I'm not saying don't look up what analysts are forecasting for your company and if your growth rate is five percent and analysts are projecting 25 growth for your company might want to stop and say is there something they're seeing that I'm not they might not but it's worth asking that question before you throw that growth rate over so you got historical growth you've got analyst estimates of growth which brings us to the third way of thinking about growth which is based upon what the company does I'm going to set up a very simplistic example to illustrate this whole idea of sustainable growth the billion dollars invest in existing projects on which it's making a 12 return so right now it's making 120 million dollars in earnings let's assume this company goes out and invests in new projects 100 million new projects on which it also makes a 12 return it's mathematically if you look at the return they're going to have after that investment they're going to have 132 million take away the extra 12 million came from the extra 12 million came from the fact that they invested 100 million new projects and earned a 12 return so when you look at the returns the earnings that a company makes it comes from Investments earning a return if I converted that into a growth rate you can actually see that my that 100 million I put back as a percentage of their earnings is what I'm reinvesting 83 percent and the 12 return that I make on the investment you know take the product of this do I get the growth rate that I saw in the company the growth rate for a company where Returns on capital is stable are coming from how much it reinvests the reinvestment rate and how will it reinvest that's the core of sustainable growth that ultimately growth comes from reinvesting more and reinvesting more but once in a while you can get growth without reinvesting right if I take that 12 return that I earned in the company and made it 13 I make my existing assets more efficient I'm going to get growth I'm going to call that efficiency growth we're going to talk about both types of growth you can get growth from reinvesting more you can get growth from becoming more efficient but here's the big difference growth from reinvesting more I can keep doing over and over for the rest of it already I might have to grow at a lower rate but I can keep doing growth from efficiency you're going to run out of steam sooner rather than later so if you tell me that for the next five years you're going to get six percent of your growth from efficiency I'm gonna say that's okay but you say forever I'm going to get a six percent growth rate forever but becoming more efficient that's not going to fly so I'm going to set the process up as as the product of how much you reinvest and how well you reinvest so this entire next section is going to be about how do you estimate what a company's reinvesting and how well it's reinvesting so I'm going to go back yeah when you say stimulated tell me the mechanics what does that mean revenues are going up because people are buying more of your product now do you have to build capacity to build that product I mean that'll explain why my revenues will go but you know but you have to produce the product right so if you still have to increase capacity the the mechanics will still be there right I still have to reinvest to get that growth because even though there's the demand for my product out there unless I can produce the product I can sell the product now it might help that the market is growing that I can do it with much better return so maybe that's the bonus I get it's sort of a good business that's growing the smartphone business 10 years ago I can grow with a very high return on Capital because I'm I'm getting I'm getting a buffer I'm essentially getting the capacity growth High returns as the market starts to slow down those returns might start to come down so the reinvestment rate times return on capital is going to apply no matter what kind of business you're in but it's easier in some business than others to get high growth so let's talk about how we measure reinvestment and how we measure the quality of investment and I'm going to go back to the three ways you can do evaluation you can focus on if you think about it you can focus on earnings per share and you can focus on net income or you can focus on operating income you use earnings per share when using the dividend discount model use net income and you're doing the free cash flow Equity model you're using operating income when you do free cash to the firm orders in all three cases I'm going to estimate reinvestment with each one notice the subtle difference in how I estimate reinvestment when I do earnings per share I estimate reinvestment as the retention ratio which is whatever I don't pay out is dividends is what I'm reinvesting okay so if I have a 40 payout ratio 60 is my retention ratio that's without earnings per share when I go to net income I can no longer use the retention ratio I've got to do my Dirty Work of saying how much is this company actually reinvesting I'm going to capture that with the capex minus depreciation plus change in working capital and to the extent that I use debt I'll factor that in I look at what's called an equity reinvestment rate how much of my net income am I putting back into the business when I'm looking at free cash flow to the firmware operating income I'm going to look at reinvestment as a percentage of after tax operating income so with each one I'm looking at how much a company is putting back but how I Define what it's putting back varies depending on looking at earnings per share net income or operate income that answers the question how much am I reinvesting how well am I reinvesting if I'm looking at earnings per share I'm going to measure it with a return in equity because earnings per share is equity earnings I divide net income by Book value Equity if I'm looking at net income from non-cash assets I'm going to look at non-cash return Equity what's non-cash return Equity I look at the portion of net income that comes from my operating assets so remove any income that I get from cash and in the denominator rather than look at book Equity I look at book Equity net of cash it's a non-cash return equity and when I look at what I'm generating as a return to the entire firm I look at return on capital or return invested Capital this is one of those things where you'll see multiple terms floating around return invested Capital return Capital employed return in my view they're all the same people dance all kinds of dances acting like they're different but ultimately you're measuring the same thing you're looking at your after tax operating income as a percentage of overall invested Capital which is Book value Equity plus book value debt minus cash I've said this before but I'll re-emphasize this is the only place in finance or who use book bags in Computing accounting returns when we do levered betas costed Capital everywhere else it's market value this is the only place we use book bags because we look at what's actually invested in projects we're trying to get a measure of how much am I making on that invested capital so to get growth I basically need how much are you reinvesting how well are you reinvesting so I'll take you through a few examples so you can see this player I'm going to start easy and look at a bank and in this case I want to try to estimate expected growth in earnings per share so this way back in time you know when I when I in the 2007-2008 I was looking at Wells Fargo I wanted to get a growth in earnings per share growth in earnings per share you measure what you reinvest with the retention ratio and how well you reinvest with the return equity that equation though puts a cap on your growth rate what's the highest retention ratio can be what's the lowest payout ratio you can have as a company zero right so the highest retention ratio you can have is a hundred percent which means your growth in the long term can never be greater than your return equity so if you have a 12 return Equity don't ask me for 25 growth in earnings per share it's just not going to happen so retention ratio times return Equity so in 2008 and I use this for Wells Fargo the return Equity was 17.56 percent this was before the crisis I'm doing it intentionally to show you one of the dangers of what happens when you look at just last year's numbers 17.56 return Equity the retention ratio was about 45 so basically it's whatever retained earnings they had divided by the net income you take the product of those two numbers the expected growth rate you would have for Wells Fargo if they can sustain the return and equity and retention ratio they had last year would be about eight percent here this was June of 2008 when I did this then of course in September of 2008 we had the banking crisis where effectively we all woke up to the reality that Banks had overreached and one of the things that came out of the crisis is regulatory authorities actually decided that they were not going to let Banks continue the way they were they're going to increase Capital requirements you know that means we return Equity right if the same net income and I required to maintain more Capital it means more Equity your return on Equity is going to go down so when you look at last year's return equity and retention ratio you can get a measure of growth but remember to use that growth rate you're also implicitly assuming that they can keep doing what they're doing to this approach it's all about having a high return Equity right higher return Equity will give you a much higher growth rate for the same retention ratio so how do you end up with a high return Equity as a company what are the two Pathways to ending up at the higher return equity how does Apple end up with a higher return equity takes great projects it's so hard though to find that there's another way you can end up with a high return Equity with taking average projects real estate people do this all the time which is you go out and borrow money at a rate lower than what you can make on your projects and the more you borrow that we saw that with the free cash flow Equity calculation right it's a mixed blessing you're getting a higher return Equity but you're also getting a higher cost of equity one of the one of the things you can do with your company is you can compute the standard return Equity net income divided by book Equity so give you a number 23 24 but you can also then follow up and say how much of that 24 is coming from great projects and how much of it is coming from my use of Leverage and there's actually an equation that you can use to do this you start with the return on Capital so if you compute the return capital in the company start with that the effect of Leverage is actually a very simple one because when you borrow money at five percent take projects that make ten percent that five percent difference goes to your Equity investors so that's what's in the brackets return Capital Minus cost Minus cost of debt and then you multiply it by how much debt to use this is actually a return Equity calculation I did for a company that used to be called Brahma it's now called mbab it's a Brazilian Beverage Company and it I did this in probably 97 the first time I went to Brazil and I got a return Equity of 31 for the company and I was surprised that was so high so I broke it down it had great projects 19.91 but about 11 of their return Equity came from the fact that they were heavy users of debt they were using debt to pump up their return equity so when you look at your company and you see a high return Equity it might be worth kicking the tires and making sure it's not coming from using leverage because as an investor you'd rather have a high return Equity the apple way of taking great projects than a high return Equity driven by Leverage so that's growth in earnings per share let's talk about growth in non-cash net income when you think about growth and non-cash net income you've got to shift your focus away from retention ratios you've got to actually look at what a company actually reinvests and we know how to do that right after cash flows it's Kappa x minus depreciation plus change in working capital and if you're looking at Equity reinvestment the equity portion of that number so I'm going to compute my reinvestment as netcap X Plus change in working capital net of the debt portion of it divided by the net income from non-cash assets so let's pause right there the retention ratio the lowest value you can have is zero percent the highest value you can have is a hundred percent right Equity reinvestment rates are not bounded can your Equity reinvestment rate be greater than 100 absolutely but then what you have to do you have to raise fresh Equity that's why it's not a per share number can your Equity reinvestment rate be less than zero and you have a negative equity reinvestment rate take a look at the equation what kinds of companies do your depreciation is greater than your capex and you don't have much in working capital needs you can end up with a negative so the first thing to remember is now you're abandoning the zero one constraints you can have a negative equity reinvestment rate if you have a shrinking company you can have a equity reinvestment here 200 300 or 400 percent if you have a company that's growing massively you get much more Flex Pay and when you talk about return Equity now you're Focus only on the portion of your Equity that's not invested in cash because you know exactly what you make on cash the table rate of commercial paper rate you're focusing on the rest of your equity so rather than focus on retention ratios it's kind of a bludgeon where you take everything that's not reinvested and treated as big going back into the company and look at overall return Equity you're looking at the portion of equity that's investing your operating assets and saying am I taking good projects so the example I'm going to use for this is Coca-Cola in 2011 2010. and some of the numbers are going to surprise you their Equity reinvestment rate was only eight percent if you look at the net capex and change in working capital basically they reinvested 957 million net of debt and as a percentage of the net income that's that's what you know it's almost that's only about eight percent of the net income you're saying how quickly can a company with an eight percent Equity reinvestment rate go well the Saving Grace was the return and Equity if you look at non-cash return Equity with 64 percent it's a simple reason for that Coca-Cola but 40 years ago spun off their bottling plants the biggest part of Coca-Cola the most Capital intensive part were the bottling plants they spun it Off made it a separate company so those of you buying Coca-Cola shares I've seen this mistake made before they buy the wrong Coca-Cola they buy the bottling company rather than the parent company and the bottling company is a very boring low margin business because you know basically sell to one custom Coca-Cola so Coca-Cola is all syrup which cost them almost nothing to make they return Equity reflects that it's a very very very profitable company in terms of return equity the expected growth rate if you take the product of those two numbers behind this participant seeking to change let me check to get that off there is about five percent so as we move from earnings per share to non-cash net income you can see I'm trying to do the same thing how much am I reinvesting how well am I reinvesting and try to bring them together last and I'll end with this last example because I know you're getting tired is let's talk about reinvestment rates and Returns on capital for the entire firm so this was you know going back in time to Cisco's peak in 1999. remember I showed that I showed you how much they reinvested their reinvestment rate which is all after time all reinvestment divided by after tax operating income is 107 percent that's pretty impressive but what made them even more impressive was the returning Capital they earned on that reinvestment was about 34 percent Cisco in 1999 was at the peak of the.com Boom considered the best.com company how the best internet company out there in terms of combined return on capitalism it's not a money losing company it actually had a 40 or a 36 percent growth rate the problem though is you look at the following decade Cisco continued to reinvest a hundred hundred and five hundred and ten percent so they kept that apart up you know what happened to the return on Capital though in the next decade it went from 36 down to 10 percent so now that growth rate dropped 11 you're saying what happened it wasn't they were reinvesting less but they were not reinvesting as productively as they were the previous decade so when you think about sustainable growth even if you never use it it's healthy to start thinking about how much is my company putting back in the business and how well is it investing and that's why we spent so much time capitalizing r d and trading leases that is we get a much better answer of those questions once we've done that so as I said this is the only place in finance return Equity return on invested Capital return on Capital calculations where we use book values so I'm going to end with the slide and if any of you are interested you can explore this further return invested capital in particular has now become this metric that every Corporate Finance consultant and every Banker uses as this golden metric and have mixed feelings about this because if you look at the numerator and the denominator of that number the numerator is an accounting number operating income the denominator results in a counting number it's Book value you're saying so what everything accountants do that change those numbers are going to affect your return invested capital now I have a very long and a very boring paper that you should read only if you have trouble sleeping I fell asleep multiple times while I was writing the paper it was so boring right it is basically about all the corrections you have to make to get the return best Capital right for a company based on financial numbers a couple of those we've already talked about we capitalize leases why because we want to get a better sense of how much data company actually owes and get a earnings we capitalize r d y because we want to get a better sense of what the company has invested in its asset and what its true earnings are but here are a few other things to watch out when you compute accounting returns when accountants or companies make mistakes you know what accountants do right they write that mistake off they didn't really take a restructuring charge you're saying so what when you take a restructuring judge what happens to your book value it's going to drop let's say it's two years later you have a company that's taken terrible Investments but it's written off all of its mistakes two years later when you compute the return in equity a return invested Capital to the company you're going to get a really good looking number right because you wrote off the 50 billion dollar mistake to get a better measure of historical returns and capital what to do you have to go back and reverse everything accountants do talk about nightmares take the reverse because if you truly want to get this what did my company do over the last 15 years using today's operating income in today's invested capital is never going to answer the question but it is worth exploring what your company's return Equity return invested Capital are before you start telling a story and valuing the company because the end game here is you want to create returns and capital that exceed your cost of capital and returns an equity that are higher than your cost of equity so I'll end with that and I will see you on Wednesday at 3 30 in the room that you've been assigned to so don't all come here because you're going to be too crowded thank you um thank you so yeah resistance [Music] [Music] first 15 minutes calculator slides are you gave his life thank you for everybody and uh you can take all of the courses from here because there's one person you take them into my office is going to be very hard to me because I start creating these different stories [Music] to logistically surely for the first 30 minutes I need to talk to the place and uh the open broker in knowledge of an iPad they're talking about the slides questions [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] so there's no support if you're doing you know you're talking about the valuations of your project are you talking about you know they're independent depends on the choice you make but how you want to value your company so it's not driven by a company schedule driven by what you decide in easier for you to do or better for you to do if you think planning the business is going to be a safer way to approach things learning The Firm then you have to start the marketing or revenues and operating modules if you believe that it's going to be the value equity and you want to pick that 
all right okay folks please settle in as I'm not I'm neither Rochester nor CFA so freebie okay folks I know you're I know you're excited about the quiz so here's what so here's what's going to happen in about two minutes Gotta Wait for people to settle in okay so here's the sequence folks come on so here's the sequence of what's going to happen in about two or three minutes the Tas are going to come here and pick up the quizzes hey guys the quiz is over can you please stop talking about two or three minutes the quizzes are going to get picked up by the Tas and they're going to be put in alphabetical order while I finish the class hopefully they'll be done by five o'clock or 4 45 and when the class is over the quizzes would put an alphabetical order it's not graded yet I would start grading obviously after I finish this class I can't grade while I teach first are these uh great evaluation MBA quizzes that got done this morning and then I will start on your quizzes but when the quizzes are done you'll get an email from me saying and it's probably going to be sooner than you think that the quizzes are done come and pick them up you're saying where it'll be on the ninth Row for kmac it'll be face down in alphabetical order that's why I made you write your name on the back if you did not not the end of the world I hope you wrote your name at least one place on the quiz because in algebra you can have only one one unknown in an equation so if you wrote your name somewhere I'm going to put it on the back it'll be face down in alphabetical order and I'd like you to take your quiz and not treat this like a bookstore don't browse through the quizzes don't look at what other people got if any of you feel that this is going to be a gigantic invasion of your privacy to have your quiz sitting out there let me know I will keep the quiz in my office but then you'll have to wait till I'm in my office to pick up your quiz if you want your quiz to be available when it's available it'll go into that alphabetical order and you can pick up your quiz I will that email when I tell you the quizzes are done I will also send you the solution to the quiz with a grading template because I start grading I'll have a template it's going to be pretty transparent about where you lost points if you did lose points please check your quiz because I have six in the next you know 500 quizzes that I'll be grading and there'll be a point this evening especially late in the evening where I'm going to get very sloppy and miss some things so if I miss something in your quiz bring it to my attention I know how this game play it works quizzes the mistakes in your favor you will not bring to my attention I fully understand that but mistakes that work against you I will fix and hopefully I don't make that many mistakes but I do make mistakes so please check your quizzes against the solution make sure that you are being treated fairly in terms of how many points I'm taking off and not taking up okay so this reason I'm not going to send you the solution right after class today is I know exactly what will happen if I send you the solution right after class you will assume that you get no credit for any mistake you'll be convinced that all of you are going to get zeros and the next thing I know you're going to freak out between today and tomorrow so the solutions won't be ready until your quiz is also ready so you can see what you actually got so with that long lead in let's um continue with what we were talking about which is growth rates okay so in the last session we talked about sustainable growth and sustainable growth we said it's about answering two questions how much are you reinvesting how well are you reinvesting where do you measure the return in equity or return invested capital or non-cash Roe you're trying to do exactly the same thing you're trying to figure out how much growth the company can get based on what it's doing so today I want to complete that discussion because that equation of growth is equal to reinvestment reinvestment rate times return Capital works if your return on capital is stable so if you have a 12 return capital from now through ever you can use a sustainable growth equation but if you return on capital is changing you're going to have a second component on your growth take a while let's assume a company with a return on Capital right now of 10 percent it reinvests nothing it's reinvestment rate is zero if I use the sustainable growth equation your reinvestment rate is zero what should your growth rate be zero right but let's say this company is able to improve its return on cap from 10 to 15 percent three investing nothing right but if you take what it's going to make as earnings this year it's 10 let's say you have a billion dollars of capital invested ten percent of a billion is 100 million next year they're going to make 15 of a billion that's 150 million you're going to get a 50 growth rate next year if you go from 10 to 15 percent that's called efficiency growth it's amazing it's great growth because you don't have to really reinvest for it the only problem is it comes with a an end right you can't keep depending on efficiency to grow but if you can grow with efficiency of course that's the first place you're going to go so that component of changing return on Capital will mean that you can have a company with a low reinvestment low return and capital actually be able to grow at a higher rate because it's improving its return on Capital thank God for that because if you have a company with a low return in capital you're going to feel doomed right because you take a low return on Capital any sustainable growth equation on that low return capital is going to give you a low growth rate the advani groups return on capital is 3.6 percent how fast can you grow when you return on capital is 3.6 if it stays at 3.6 percent you need efficiency growth that those companies to get any kind of growth so I'm gonna do a little exercise and I'm going to show you five companies that all have the same growth in earnings and I want you to rank them from high growth to low growth so as you look at these companies you notice the bottom line growth is the same but I want you to think about which of these companies has the most valuable growth and which one has the least valuable growth right so all of these companies have 10 growth they all look the same in terms of growth but the way they get there is very different the first company has a reinvestment rate of so you can see different combinations of reinvestment rate and return on Capital and different returns an invested capital so I want you to think about which of these companies has the least valuable growth in fact it can be value destroying growth which of these companies is at the worst growth rate even though the growth rate looks the same which one is you know is going to create the least value and what is it about three that should worry they're growing but they're reinvesting huge amounts at a return and capital of five percent it's actually lower than the cost of capital they're growing but it's terrible growth in terms of best possible growth if I ask you for a one-year growth you'd obviously want all of it to come from efficiency right because you're reinvesting nothing but remember it's a one-year growth the companies that generate the most value the companies that earn higher Returns on Capital because now you're getting the same growth rate with far less reinvesting when you look at your company and you see a bottom line growth rate of 15 20 25 it's easy to get dazzled by by growth rates but take a step back and say how is this growth being created how much are they reinvesting to generate the growth because the more you're reinvesting to get that same growth rate the less valuable you become as a company so value of growth essentially comes from how much you reinvest how well you reinvest and it can add value destroy value or do nothing for Value any questions on on those two drivers of value reinvestment rate and return on Capital so with that lead let's talk about the most generic way of thinking about growth and this is basically your guidance on using that ginzo spreadsheet the ginzo spreadsheet is designed for any type of company stable growth and stable return Capital unstable return Capital Rising margins dropping margins so I'm going to take you through the process by which you can take any company money losing money making young old and think about projecting future numbers when your margins are changing you have to start with revenues do you see why because your margins are changing forecasting operating income becomes a crap you're going to start by projecting Revenue so we're going to talk about hey how do we get Revenue growth rates why 10 is opposed to 30 but that's going to be the driver of growth in your company's Revenue growth so you got to take into account how big your company is how big the market is your story will drive that growth rate so that's a revenue growth rate second stop you got to get take a look at the margins are the margins going to rise over time drop over time what are you going to look at you're going to look at the competition you can look at the company you can look at its competitive advantages the margin times revenues is going to give you operating income and then the third leg is to grow your revenues you got to tell me how much you need to reinvest because I'm focusing on revenues I've now have to tie invested Capital not to operating income but to revenues that sales to investment Capital just my shortcut for saying hey for any given investment in capital how much revenue you generate as a company the higher that number the more efficiently you're generating growth so how quickly are you growing how profitable is your business model how much are you reinvesting to get that future growth I challenge you to find me any non-financial service company where you can't capture its business model with those three questions they take each one separately let's say you have a company and ask you what's your Revenue growth rate you want to give me a high number or a low number if it's your company would you you want a high number right so if I left each variable I wouldn't think what you want a high Revenue growth rate then I turned to margin what would you like your margin to look like over time to become a high margin or a low March you at a high margin then I ask you about reinvestment do you want a high reinvestment or a low reinvestment you want to be able to get away with as little reinvestment as possible left to your own devices you've got to pick and choose I want High margins high growth low reinvestment and in a world where you can tell fairy tales it's exactly where you're going to go right you're going to hit 50 growth and revenue so margins are going to end up at 70 percent you're going to reinvest nothing and you're going to be worth trillions of dollars but here's the problem when you make forecast these numbers you've got to think about the market you're in the world you're in the business you're in so let's take each of these a little bit about some of some of the things you're going to focus on to decide whether to give your company a high growth rate or low growth so let's say gravity growth the first and biggest issue you've got to wrestle with when you think about Revenue growth is how big is the market that I'm going after this is in Silicon Valley it's called Tam a total addressable Market it's become this game that people play but if you're realistic you're saying I am a company in a business I want to see how big the market is I need to know how big the market is to get a sense of how quickly my company can grow the reason this is a little subjective is I'll give you an example when I first valued Uber in 2013. remind me again what business Uber was in in 2013 remember this was before food delivery they were our service company right sharing companies A Car Service Company so what's the total Market it's taxi cabs and you know at that time limo companies I added all the numbers up and I came up with the total addressable Market of 100 billion and I screwed up I was right about the total addressable Market but what I wasn't factoring in was Uber was changing Behavior to the point that people who would not use car service would use car service to things they didn't need my youngest son was on my credit card for a long time with Uber and on Saturday nights I'd get like seven Uber charges I think he was using Uber to go from the bedroom to the bathroom right he was like no six dollars here four dollars there fifteen dollars here I mean things he would never have done in a taxi cab you know what that means right that hundred billion dollar total addressable Market has become like 350 billion dollars because not only people's behavior changed but in the Bay Area people have stopped buying their own cars why buy a car pay for parking pay for insurance when there's a ride sharing service right outside that is what I missed in 2013. if you look my subsequent valuation with Uber my total addressable Market has to factor in the behavior changes companies have learned from Uber so essentially now when companies come out to their estimates of total addressable Market they balloon out the market Uber when they went public in 2019 in their IPO said that total addressable Market was 5.2 trillion dollars you know how they came up with the 5.2 trillion they took what people were spending on buying cars they put in there Mass Transit there basically they took everything that anybody ever spent on transportation and threw it in there it's completely unrealistic right but you know why they want to hold the 5.2 trillion up to you because you as an investor are going to look at the 5.2 trillion and you're going to jump to the conclusion then hey Uber can have a trillion dollars in Revenue there's zero chance of that happening but companies have learned Airbnb when it went public said it's total addressable Market was three trillion dollars you know what hotels collectively made its revenues in 2020. 600 billion dollars I know Airbnb is going to draw people into the hospitality business who might not have gone but it's not going to make the market five times there's a lot of gaming in total markets and you can see why you're not in Silicon Valley selling a business you're trying to Value business you have to be realistic so if you see estimates of total addressable market for your company it's your job to ask does that make sense but you're going to start with the second component you got to ask is what percentage of that market will be mine right so if you tell me the total addressable Market is a trillion let's say it's a realistic estimate you got to tell me hey are you going to get 30 of the market 40 50 or 10 and what what will drive that market share is the business economics of that market one of the things that technology has done is it's created more winner take all markets I'll give you an example the old days advertising was a very splintered business because we wanted to advertise in New York you put in your ad in the New York Times you want to invest in La you put in the LA Times there's no way that if you want to invest in the UK you're going to go through a U.S media because people in the UK didn't watch you you know how Google and Facebook changed that if you're Google or Facebook you're not constrained by geography you essentially can go out and appeal to the entire Market and that's essentially changed the advertising business Google and Facebook you know together control about 60 of all of the online advertising business and that's happening in market after market how does it play out if you're it's called networking benefits where basically the larger you get as a company the easier it becomes for you to grow because you know advertisers want to go where everybody else's what I'm trying to say is when you try to estimate your Revenue growth rate your challenge is figuring out what's the market I'm going after so you got to figure out what that market is and what percentage of the market will be mine and that's a market share and within that that business you got to ask if I'm competing in four other companies what are my competitive advantages why would I get a higher market share than somebody else what do I do differently so those that combination is what's going to tell you whether your company can end up with a hundred billion in revenues in your 10 or a trillion dollars in revenues I know I've been sending you the valuation the week you have I think you've even stopped looking at them you should look at the Star Wars one though that was one of my favorite valuations of all time I did it right after I saw Force One I was around Christmas and we have this tradition our family and the Christmas Eve we go to a movie take the stress off you know gift giving and we're into Force One we come back home and then I tell my family look I have something to do this is Christmas Eve what do you want to do I say I feel the urge to Value the Star Wars franchise is a dad you're weird but you know but you know what I did so what you see in that original blog post was a Christmasy post on here's how it's a fun valuation because it talks about how do you value a franchise like Star Wars of course at the movies but remember this is a franchise that's lived on merchandising right I mean George Lucas created an entire universe I think thousands of this is a merchandiser's dream think of all the different characters you can create so it's essentially a it's but when you think about not valuing a company you've got to step back and say hey what is the business I'm going after what is a market share that's going to tell you what kind of Revenue growth through but take a look at my Tesla valuation because I had to wrestle with these right what's a total addressable Market presumably anybody who buys a car and the percentage of those cars to be electric cars already you can see you can make judgment calls right the number of cars sold is not going to dramatically shoot up it's about 80 to 90 million it's been around that number in fact you could argue that it might actually decrease over time but the percentage of those cars that are going to be electric cars is going to rise so if you're an optimist about Tesla you're assuming that that percentage will be 60 70 or even 100 of all car slope so that's going to give me the total model I then have to estimate what percentage of that market will belong to Tesla sure again you're making judgment calls how much more advanced is a Tesla electric car than a Ford electric car or a Volvo electric car and will that difference persist over time because that's going to make a difference as to whether you get 60 market share 40th no automobile company in history has ever had a market share that exceeds 20 percent why because there's so many different segments to the market right you've got Mass automobiles luxury it's very difficult to be all things to all people so Volkswagen and Toyota right now about 10 market shares that's pretty much the P maybe that's a little bit different maybe the nature of the business will give them 30 market shares but to estimate Revenue growth for Tesla I had to make those judgments is it easy of course not are you going to be wrong absolutely but how can you make judge value Tesla without making judgments on those factors and those will all feed into your Revenue growth numbers so if any of you have a young company that you're valuable with more mature companies you can get away with cheating right you can look at the Historical growth Coca-Cola who cares what the total addressable Market looks like you're giving them five percent growth and a pretty big market share and the market is pretty mature but you are valuing a company that's young it's evolving it's changing uh you know it could be Airbnb still it could be a Peloton you have to make some judgment pellet on the Judgment you're making is what percentage of people are going to shift away from exercising in gyms to shift to exercising at home what percentage of those people will want to spend the two thousand or four thousand dollars it takes to buy a Peloton bike or a Peloton treadmill and how many of those people will pay 40 a month I remember when Peloton went public there's a Southside equity research analyst who came on CNBC so everybody has pelotons they said God you need to get out of your apartment building in New York and walk a few blocks maybe you live in an apartment building where everybody has Peloton but trust me no very few people can afford to pay 480 a year for Peloton subscriptions on top over four thousand dollars so when you think about Revenue growth think about these factors because they will all come into play so I'll take you you know later on I'll show you my Airbnb evaluation but in a valued Airbnb I started by looking at the hotel business no I I learned my lessons from Uber saying you know you know but I wanted to start that because I need to know what people spend on hotels before I can make judgment calls on Airbnb so what you see to the left is you basically see the size of their business in 2019 this is a year before Airbnb went public hotels collectively had revenues of 630 billion dollars so that's a collective revenues at all publicly traded hotels around the world 630 billion if you look at the business itself it's pretty concentrated so this is a traditional Hotel business a few big hotel names control the business the Marriotts the Hilton so basically you can go through the list so this is a business that's pretty big it's concentrated for whatever reason people prefer to go to chains that they recognize they don't want to go to it and finally if you look at the market size the US is the biggest Market but China is catching up that's basically you're getting perspective you're just saying this is not about Airbnb let me get a sense of the market and I would strongly suggest that that's where you start look at the existing business look at the Players because you can try to get a sense of what drives this market so if you look at the the Airbnb Prospectors though they estimate they're serviceable you know Silicon Valley loves to make up acronyms so that the serviceable addressable Market it's called sap and they won't even use Services they would say the Sam is in your place or what Sam that's part of the reason they use words like this you have no idea what they're talking about the Sam is 1.5 trillion including 1.2 so they give you details but the total addressable Market they claimed was 3.4 trillion that they could sell other services as part of Airbnb if you notice if you rent an Airbnb it used to be that the host would offer you if you're going to say they'd offer you touring services that they take they've given up on that because very clearly it doesn't make sense to bundle it all into your host right so if you want to visit a city and you want to tour the city you don't want your host to be the the tour guide because he or she might not be the best tour guide but Airbnb had this vision of we're going to bundle this stuff and the objective is to make the market as big as possible which would then make higher revenues therefore more feasible so try your best as I said you're going to be wrong but you know you have to make that judgment call on what the market is and what the market share is to basically get a sense of what Revenue growth can I use for my company as I said don't look at the growth rates look at the Mark the revenues you have in your 10 and ask yourself can my company story sustain those Refuge let's move to margins okay so right now your margin could be any number right if you're a young company it could be minus three percent minus ten percent minus fifty percent depending on how young it is I'm not interested in what your existing margin is I'm interested in what your margin can be in steady state you know what drives us I mean as I said if I gave you a choice it all like 70 margins right but margins are determined by unit economics what are unit economics it's what you make on that extra unit that you sell if you're in a business with the extra unit you sell costs you almost nothing you can have much higher margins than a business that has to spend a lot of money to generate the extra yield I'm not trying to be mysterious but how much does it cost Microsoft to sell an extra copy of off I mean you can't even call it a copy everything is digital you go on Microsoft said I want to be an Office 365 subscriber you think that some person's carrying around saying I need to produce a copy of Office 365 somebody just bought it it cost them almost nothing so when you look at the operating modules for Microsoft you see numbers like 35 40 45 margins because almost all of what they sell is pure profit in contrast if you buy a Tesla no matter how well it's run you expect a car delivered right not a virtual car but a real car they have to make the car I know this is stating the obvious and making the car no matter how efficient you are will cost you money the way this shows up is there's a number called gross margin gross margin is the difference between what you get on the extra unit what so if you look at your company's gross margin if your gross margins are 70 80 or 85 percent your operating margins can be high so even money losing companies if they're in business with good unit economics the gross margins would look great the net margins are all pretty much would be terrible because there are other costs but they can grow out of it but if your gross margins are low you can't tell me that your operating margin is going to be 70 or 80 percent of your gross margins only 30 percent Tesla's gross margin last year was about 30 that's actually very good for an automobile company but it also means that Renee or Kathy would say there's going to be an ebitda margin of 60 and Tesla I've got to ask what exactly are they selling it's got to be software right you can't be a car there is a mo there's a story I can tell for Tesla you know that a Tesla without its software it's just a pile of junk right because you take the software out of the Tesla nothing works I mean let me tell you a story and you you might say I would never pay for that let's say you buy a Tesla and I tell you every year from now on it'll cost you two thousand dollars to upgrade your software changes the model entirely right that is the story you will need to tell for Tesla to be worth what it is is there's a side product they're selling where the unit economics are such they can generate much higher margins because the automobile business has bad unit economics it takes you a lot of money to build the car and sell it you're not going to make the margins that a software company does so look at unit economics and there's also a trade-off if you're going to give your company high growth and a high market share it's fine right but think of how you get a high market share often you got to cut prices you can't be charging sixty thousand dollars for a car like Tesla is and expect to get a 40 market share why because people don't have the money to spend because remember we're talking about the market around the world you're talking about Chinese consumers and Indian consumers paying sixty thousand dollars there is no way you're going to get a Neo is going to beat you every single time to selling the cars what does that mean there's a trade-off here if you want to give your company High Revenue growth I will not contest you but then if you also give them high operating margins I'm going to ask you well how exactly is that happening you might tell me a story where you can pull that off but essentially your inputs for growth and margins can't be independent they've got to be tied together by a story that actually makes sense so what do you target as a margin is going to be driven by what kind of business model you have what are the unit economics and that's going to determine where you end up whether you end up with a seven percent margin of 15 margin so when I ask you what's your target margin 10 years from another gives a spreadsheet don't just set this out like a high margin let me enter 40 look at your business look at the other companies in the business and make sure the margin you're entering is a number that is sustainable which brings me to to what I did for Airbnb for Airbnb the operating margin I had when I started the valuation was minus ten percent the typical operating margin for a hotel company is about 11 or 12 percent if I valued Airbnb as a hotel company the margins of the conversion 11 to 12 percent but Airbnb is not a typical Hotel company right it's an intermediary because it's an intermediary the unit Economics work in their favor so rather than look at hotel companies for margins I looked at Expedia and booking.com booking.com in particular is like an old-fashioned it's an old economy Airbnb they were around before Airbnb what was different was booking.com worked with existing hotels they didn't bring in apartments now they're starting to bring in apartments the margins you see there are more reflective what an intermediary can make so as you value a company you think about Revenue growth and margins and how much will they reinvest think about the economics of the business what are they structured as and what makes your business more attractive on one dimension can make them less attractive on another one what gives them high growth but also push down the margins for that business so you've got revenue growth got a framework for thinking about margins let's bring in third input and this is the input on which you're going to struggle with because you have no you know when you look at it sales to Capital what the heck is that now you're going to wonder now what can I do to to come up with the numbers so let me let me again set up the structure sales to Capital you're taking revenues and dividing by invested Capital remember how we did return investment Capital we took after tax operating income into what that same invested Capital I'm dividing revenues but you're saying what does that tell me the more efficiently you can generate revenues the higher that ratio should be so companies that which are efficient about generating revenues should have much higher sales and capital ratios so what will determine that efficiency it could be that you know again let's use Tesla as an example for the longest time Teslas push for a very different way of manufacturing cars from the typical automobile company more robots online you know more mechanized more automated production and the center of an electric car is the battery so the extent that you can make the cost of the battery drop and you can deliver it efficiently you can push up your sales capillation and here again if you are a Tesla Optimist they've done some really good thing the sales recappa ratio for Tesla is about twice as high as the sales to Capital ratio for a typical automobile company you gotta get Elon musk's Credit in a sense not only has he come up with you know has he made the electric car the center of the automobile business he's kind of shaken up existing ways of thinking about order because when he first started people said you've got to build big assembly plants there's no way you can make cars without having the if you've ever been to Michigan and you've got been by one of those old automobile plans they're like they stretch for Miles huge huge huge Contraptions extraordinarily Capital intensive and he said what why should I do that he actually the Fremont plant was actually a GM plant that he took over which is his first the first Tesla plan it was It produced about 50 000 GM cars He Made It produced 250 000 Tesla cars so in a sense they figured out a way to kind of take existing models and say let's make them more efficient so sales to Capital ratio is essentially a measure of how efficiently can you generate Revolution so left your own devices you want to use a high number there but you're going to be constrained by first what the business you're in in some businesses as you get bigger you might be able to increase the sales to operation otherwise you get more efficient in other businesses you might actually find the sales to Capital ratio decreasing so when I ask you what the sales of capital ratio is I give you three chances to give me that number I say what is it next year what is it for you two through five what is it Beyond year five to give you a chance of saying has my company gets bigger my sales Capital ratio could change it'll depend on the economics of your business second if you have a company with excess capacity doesn't have to be a manufacturing company to be a service company you know what you basically get you get a freebie for the first few years you're able to grow with relatively little reinvestment your sales and capital ratio can be high for the next year the next two years the next five years because you're living off excess capacity again take a look at my Tesla valuation because now you can look at it in fresh eyes and say why did you use a five a sales to Capital ratio five for the next five years because the Shanghai plant that just gone online and I did that valuation it's only partially used with covert it's been slowed down that plant has the capacity to cover their revenue growth for the next three or four years and I'm giving them the credit for that by saying look I'll allow you to have a much higher sales Capital ratio for the next three or four years but then I'm going to bring it back down because you've got to build back for fresh capacity beyond that point in time and there's one final point in the in in the in the model itself but Simplicity I make your reinvestment contemporaneous with your Revenue you know what I mean by contemporate is your Revenue growth jumps in year one your reinvestment happens in the same year so I'm assuming that if you reinvest you get an immediate jump in revenues some businesses that's okay right or if you do Acquisitions to grow that's the way it is but if you are a Manufacturing Company remember there's a lag between the time you reinvest and this capacity might take you three years I think in the Tesla actually builds its plans pretty quickly but it takes about two to three years so what will happen is your reinvestment you reinvest in year one but your sales will not start to grow till year three or if you're a pharmaceutical company what what did we say your reinvestment takes a form of r d right so if you want growth in your tent you got to reinvest now there's a lag between reinvestment and growth and you can adjust the spreadsheet very easily to reflect that right because all it means is instead of connecting the reinvestment to this year's Revenue growth you tie it to the revenue growth five years from now you're getting a five-year lag something to think about when you think about sales to Capital is that lag and how it'll affect you in business-like infrastructure the lag between reinvestment and growth is huge right you build an airport it might take you six seven eight years before you even see any cash flows forget about seeing growth on those cash flows so when you value the company there the the three key inputs to drive your valuation a revenue growth talk in fact how about I've kind of concentrated the model and said give me those three numbers I'll value the company at some level it does simplify valuations it's Revenue growth Target margin sales cap but remember behind each of those numbers is an entire story you need to tell and all of the things you need to think about for your company that will determine what inputs you use for your company so let me close off again with Airbnb so I showed you what drove my Airbnb assumptions on revenues I made Airbnb have revenues of 150 billion dollars just to give you perspective you're not Marriott's revenues for last year about 30 billion you see how the heck is that because as an intermediary you can be much bigger in terms of revenues because you're not constrained by having to build hotels to make them about as big as booking.com booking.com is 150 to 200 it's feasible they do it's it's a reach but they can get there I gave them margins of 25 why they're an intermediary so I gave them high margins and to close the process I need a sales capillation the sales to Capital ratio I gave them was two dollars in revenues for every dollar of capital investment you often think of intermediary businesses as not Capital intensive I've heard people say Uber can grow without reinvesting that's not true they have to reinvest in different things you know how their investment what they have to reinvest in acquiring entire businesses now so when they go out and they buy to get that growth they have to so it's not that you don't reinvest because you reinvest differently and this 1.9 to their existing sales cap ratio I'm giving them a little blip and the sales to Capital ratio reflects the fact that if they want to keep growing they've got to invest in computers and infrastructure and Acquisitions because that's the only way they can get their revenues from where they are today to the the expected and remember once they get to those revenues of 150 billion they don't get the 150 billion dollars as revenues right I think right now Airbnb takes 14 percent of whatever you paid used to be they collected from both sides right they collected from the host and they collected from the guest they've changed their business model to collect it all from the host don't celebrate them because indirectly the host passes it on to you but they did it because they didn't want to deal with two people anymore they wanted to I you know make it one I think it's about 14 now it's not and that's a key part of the model could that change though yeah if they get competition from some other technological device that says we'll only take 10 as a host you're going to say I'll go there but there's got to be this networking effect so VRBO says that you're not going to do it because they don't have enough listings on them so this is in another the quiz is over you want to forget about this class this is a good time to take your first shot of the fcff Ginsu model okay because these are the inputs you're going to think about so put the numbers in do a 15 minute valuation you can always come back and tweet them yeah foreign so this company is basically running in place 10 return on capital is equal so the new Investments are doing nothing they're getting efficiency growth of eight percent but that's going to be one year so if you go past one year it's going to go to two percent right so when you think about just one year you can say firm one and four about five but if you think about this as a predictive future growth I'd rather have a wonderful because for one that can continue beyond year one so when you think about quality of growth you're not just thinking about your one you're also thinking about year two you're three or four and the companies that have efficiency growth it's a one one cylinder so if you take firm five it's actually incredibly good you're reinvesting nothing is wrong at 10 but it's going to be a one and done deal right next year you'll have a 10 growth that happens that you're going to drop to zero so maybe the best thing to do is project that five-year growth rate for each of these companies and Company one you'll have ten percent growth every year and Company four you're gonna have ten percent growth in your one two percent in years two through five and Company Five you're gonna have ten percent growth in your wine and zero percent growth so that becomes the dividing line like what drives a value did you take the quiz and turn it in it'll automatically get shifted remember your worst squares gets thrown out thank you okay um and then have less okay whoa I saw the Mainframe 
what the question wait a minute that was my name sorry yeah yeah sorry I'm sorry okay folks a few quick announcements before I start first is good news next week is spring break the bad news is if it's spring break we're almost to the half way point of the class the crap is going to hit the fan right after you come back from spring break because everything is going to start to come to you on this project it's already happening right so it's a mid-semester you know pick up your quiz when you get a chance so you know denial is not going to make the quiz go away so not picking it up doesn't mean it doesn't exist so it's for some people that might be a redeeming feature so pick it up the score check his score in fact make sure you check your score on the quiz make sure I have it screwed up on the grading check your score in brightspace to make sure it matches the score in your quiz don't assume that there is no human error as I said because no we're getting the Midway point of the class it's my my job to remind you that if you want to get feedback on your intrinsic valuation I need to get it by the end of this month so if you haven't even opened up the spreadsheet you might want to do it I'm not saying you should work on it during spring break no but do you know you can you need to at least get started right it's not going to get done and it's all so work on So today we're going to talk about that big number in every discounted cash flow evaluation the terminal value it's a number where the most damage gets done in valuation because people do some really weird stuff okay so today's start of the class test I'm going to focus on some of the questions that are going to drive so the first question you know to get the terminal value value of the company in your fiber your 10 I'm going to give you four choices and I want you to tell me the one choice you should never use because it doesn't belong in an intrinsic valuation a liquidation value is that okay in an intrinsic valuation in other words you stop and you attend you liquidate all the assets you get cash flows there's no problem with that in fact you know what kinds of companies you do it on declining companies maybe private businesses or a lease runs out after year 10 liquidation value is perfectly okay how about stable growth models let's hope it's okay because otherwise everything that you see in my book kind of breaks down after you get to the terminal value right so you assume a growth rate in perpetuity are you allowed to assume instead of a perpetuity just that 15 years or 20 years of cash flows after year 10 in other words a growing annuity I don't see why why not it is a present value as well I've kind of answered the one way you should never estimate terminal value which is what's called an exit multiple Bankers do it all the time almost every one of their DCFS yes now they get the terminal value they get ebitdon year 10. multiply it by eight times that beta which I get by looking at other companies in the sector or the group and come up with the terminal value why is that why should you never if 80 of banking valuations do this I want you to be able to explain to Bankers why it shouldn't be done because you're going to be on the other side of the table asked to do this and know whether you want to bring this up with your managing director who thinks this is the way to get terminal value but tell me what's fundamentally wrong with using eight times epitor to get a terminal value maybe by the time I get to the terminal you're much similar companies will have different growth but there's a much more fundamental reason it goes back to the yeah good in other words that's why we drew this contrast we need value and price right I said you can either do an intrinsic valuation of a company based on cash flows growth and risk or you can price the company and what have you done when you make the terminal value of multiple you've made your biggest number in intrinsic valuation into a pricing this is neither fish nor foul it's not a DCF it's not a pricing I'm not even sure what it is but as I said eighty percent of banking valuations do this because it's easy to play games that make say eight in fact they put it as a table that's almost pre-produced I think at the bottom of these what will happen to my terminal value if I use six times eight times ten times the obvious thing is the higher the multiple the higher the terminal but you should be using any of them in the first place so now let's get to specifics let's assume you're looking at a company with a hundred million in after tax operating income so you're getting to the terminal here so you're 100 million enough to tax office you have no growth expected in perpetuity you have a cost to Capital of ten percent so this is a purely mechanical question if you have 100 million in cash flows in after tax operating income I've been giving you cash flows I've given you a growth rate of zero that's a clue and I want you to get terminal value with the 10 cost to Capital what's the terminal value and I want somebody to explain reason say what do you what do you think the terminal value should be first what am I what what does it look like I'm not giving up giving you earnings but I'm not giving you net capex and change in working capital and reinvestment why do you not need them no growth which means no reinvestment no reinvestment banks say after tax operate income becomes your cash flow you got a hundred million in cash flows divide by 0.10 because you have no growth your terminal value is a billion dollars everybody agree with that let's play some Magic here let's assume that I now tell you that this company can grow two percent a year forever so I have a question for you my terminal value go up go down remain unchanged Etc you can't tell but first how many of you think the terminal value will go up like most people assume if I change the growth rate the total value will go up right looks like math the match should work in your favor in fact here's what you do you take 100 million divided by 0.10 minus 0.02 it's one point this is magical you've added 250 million dollars to the value but what am I missing when I do that the two percent growth is helping me but what am I what do I have in the numerator after tax operating income which assumes I don't reinvest any money do I have a problem here I have a giant problem I'm assuming growth without reinvesting assume how much I need to reinvest what what is the missing piece of the puzzle what do you need to know to estimate how much you need to reinvest you remember the sustainable growth equation we talked about and see it's steady state what's growth it's reinvestment trade times return on Capital right we play a game Let's assume a return on capital is ten percent you grow at two percent a year how much will you need to reinvest two percent divided by ten percent is a twenty percent reinvestment rate your cash flows are being a hundred million will become 80 million because you got to reinvest what's 80 million divided by 0.08 it's a billion still this is like magic I put in a two percent growth rate nothing happened to my terminal value you want to put in a four percent growth rate be my guest it'll still be a bill why because I'm assuming that you can earn a return equal to the cost of capital what if I assumed a return capital of five percent so to get a two percent growth rate with a five percent return on Capital how much will I need to reinvest Command 2 divided by 5 you can work it on your headers forty percent forty percent of a 100 million is 40 million I'll have 60 million in my numerator I'm going to be in trouble right because my terminal value now will actually decrease as I put in a two percent growth rate why because my return on capital is less than the cost of capital people make a big deal about growth rate and perpetuity that's the big assumption no it's not it's a return on Capital that you assume that goes with the growth rate that's going to determine what will happen to your terminal value and today we'll talk about what to assume about that number because it's one of the inputs I ask you for in this fcff simple questions what will the return on Capital be after year 10 you probably said who knows and who cares we'll talk about some of the things you want to think about as to whether you should set that return above your cost to Capital equal to the cost of capital below your cost of capital because ultimately it's not growth that creates values growth with excess returns so let's move back to the slides I think we were on slide 190 let's see why not guess terminal value slide I'm very fond of Mexican food so I'm going to call it the big enchilada this is the number that you look at the detail and say oh my God that's a big number so let's dig a Little Deeper on why we need the terminal value in the first place remember what we said at the start of this class the value of an asset is the present value of the expected cash flows over its lifetime right the problem we run into is if you have a company which in theory could last forever you can't estimate cash flows for hours so this is a practical problem you run into I can't estimate cash flows forever I've got to stop at some point in time and when I stop at some point in time I can't assume my company disappears I'm going to estimate what the value of my company will be when I stop that's really the chat challenge you face that's what a terminal value is trying to compute so let's think about the ways to compute terminal value and I've kind of given away the answer with the start of the class test today which is you can do a liquidation value perfectly okay it's a cash flow it is appropriate either in public companies that are decaying or declining or it could also be in private businesses where when the owner drives the business is going to die with the owner so you have a liquidation back second is a going concern perpetuity this is the r minus G that we use the perpetuity that use that equation you got to use a growth rate that's less than or equal to the growth rate of the economy in which you operate we talk about why it's a math issue not a finance or an economics issue that's a go that's a going concern Assumption of perpetuity you could also make a going concerned assumption where you say look I don't want to assume forever that's too much I'm going to assume 40 years or 50 years or 80 years and estimate the cash flows over that period you get a little more leeway in what kind of growth rate you can use when that's the case and the last of course is this exit model this is a pricing as I said the first three are all perfectly okay I think we under utilize liquidation value we're under utilize no growing growing annuities but we should never be using a pricing in the first place Revenue it doesn't matter earnings whatever multiple use you're making your biggest number in your DCF into a pricing so you really your choice is do I want to assume a liquidation value or do I want to assume a growth rate beyond your debt in some cases you might use a liquidation value and most of your companies so it's it's going to give you too lower number because essentially you're shutting your company down so let's be very clear liquidation doesn't mean you're selling the company you're breaking it up into pieces and selling it on eBay if that's the way you want to do it so if I did a liquidation value for Disney you know what I do I dismantle Disneyland and put up Peter Pan right for sale keep it in your backyard now pay a couple of millions I'm sure there'll be people who pay but the liquidation value reflects the breaking down of the company selling off the assets so let's focus on this growth rate and perpetuity because that's the the form you see most often in valuation yep it will give you for most companies it will right because you're shutting the company on Microsoft's liquidation value it's going to be a fraction of its values are going concerned especially for businesses which have which don't have physical assets I'm not sure how to even liquidate maybe brand names maybe somebody who paid for the windows name or the office name so liquidation value will give you a loan which is part of the reason you tend not to see it with public companies because usually a business is worth more as a going concern then it isn't but there are exceptions I take Bed Bath and Beyond is worth more in liquidation than it is as a going concern sell it to get whatever you can for those leases maybe people will pay you up so you're in a truly declining Bad Business liquidation value can exceed you're going concerned about it but let's look at that equation right this is a classic liquidation value equation you get to your 10 to get the terminal value in year 10 you estimate the cash flows in Year 11. let me repeat that again to get your terminal value in year 10 you always need cash flows one year out why because that's where present value equations all work cash flows to be one year past your present value day cash flows in year 11 divided by R minus G take a look at that equation you can already see the potential for mission you're an analyst you valued a company you come up with too low a number you know what I mean by too low right you're managing directly expected to see 50 you're stuck at 22. it's late on a Saturday night and you want to get the 22 to 50. my advice is don't play with the growth rate in year one in year two it's going to take you far too long to get to 50. go to your terminal value take the growth rate it's right now with two percent your discount rate is eight percent make the two go to three three to four and if you leave the cash flows fixed and that's the magical part As you move towards your cost of capital you're going to get what I call Buzz Lightyear valuations to infinity and beyond you see you are right as G approaches R what's going to happen to your terminal value it's going to approach infinity and you've got G increases above R God help you you're beyond infinity I don't know what's that but I don't want to come in there with you I once in a while I get a discounted cash flow evaluation from somebody say I got a negative value for my company I don't know what I'm doing wrong I've used a 15 growth rate forever for Microsoft and I keep getting a negative value I'm not even sure how to respond if you put a 15 growth rate forever and your discount rate is eight percent of course you're going to get a negative value there's nothing wrong with the model there's something wrong with you right I mean in a sense you make assumptions that really don't make sense of course you're going to get strange looking numbers don't blame the model it's an inanimate object it's a mathematical equation so if you're thinking about growth rate in forever let's put some limits on it push that growth rate cannot exceed the growth rate of the economy in which you operate I really agree with that this is not economics it's not Finance it's math because you know you'd be surprised how many people in a valued Tesla the biggest pushback I got was why are you setting the growth rate at four percent a year forever after year 10 27 12 year forever Tesla is a special company this has nothing to do with Tesla being a special company if I let Tesla grow 12 percent a year forever in U.S dollar terms in an economy growing at four percent per year forever what's going to happen sooner rather than later it's going to become the U.S economy then globalization it's going to become the global economy then what interplanetary travel with Tesla you could actually tell a story that they will use SpaceX to launch testless into outer space sell them to martians you got to find them first there's some assumptions in valuation where we can disagree so if you use a revenue growth rate of 25 for the next five years and I use 15 that's a difference of opinion but this is one of those things where there can be no give right you think what if I just let the growth rate be just above the growth rate of the economy just a little bit it's like being a little bit pregnant you're either pregnant or you're not it's zero one right it's not like it's just a little bit this is one of those rules you don't want to mess with because once you start messing with it it's going to blow up in your face yep what do you have a company that's like thousands in many different markets I said the economy in which you operate I would say it's a domestic economy right you can make it the global economy then you're saying what if I'm a high growth market like China what is the growth rate in the Chinese economy 20 years ago 10 12 the most recent projection that Beijing made for the economy this is in a sense a high water mark for the growth rate is now five percent see that's terrible 20 years ago the Chinese economy was the seventh largest economy in the world you had room to grow at the expense of other con eventually your growth rate is going to converge on a global growth rate no country is ever going to be able to maintain it it's the same reason a company can't grow at a great rate higher than the economy countries eventually will hit a wall not because it's again the math working against you So eventually if you want to make the argument that your company is a global company and give it a global real growth rate that might be higher than your domestic real growth rate which a lot of European companies are doing right if Nestle stays in Switzerland the shrinking population the Aging population I don't know how much chocolate they can eat there's only so much you can sell but by making a global argument might be able to use a higher real growth rate so that's your cap you know what do you mean cap let's say the nominal growth rate is four percent I've said you can't exceed four percent can you be lower than four percent can it come absolutely in fact you could make the argument that mature companies in an economy should grow at a rate less than the growth rate of the economy and here's what remember they're both growth companies and mature companies in the economy if every mature company grows at four percent the growth rate of the economy then what all growth companies go for their higher growth so if you have a sector that's growing at 15 almost mathematically there will be other sectors that grow at less than the growth rate of the economy so it's four percent they're okay to use three you can use two can use zero percent growth and these minus three percent growth wherever why not the equation works you think why would I do that if you're valuing a tobacco company or a fossil fuel company what's the story we're telling about both businesses tobacco is going to shrink as a business because fewer people are smoking the smokers are aging so unless you decide to diversify into cannabis so something else that younger people might smoke you're kind of looking at a future of shrinking revenues fossil fuels with climate change but whatever you think about the near term eventually you might make the argument that these companies are going to end up with negative growth rates unless so unless you have a story that tells how your company leaves the space it's perfectly okay to use a negative program what does it even mean when you say negative growth rate and perpetuity here's what you do to your company it peaks in your your attack and then it shrinks over time gradually to disappear which actually is the way actual life cycles work right it's only in discounted cash flow evaluation that every company becomes this huge Mammoth monstrous company over time because we assume that every company grows at three percent a year forever where do all these gigantic companies coexist in the economy so be okay using a negative growth rate of any of your value companies where you think look at the business and say this is a bad business it's only going to shrink over time and finally remember the big deal we made about consistency this morning I got an email it's almost perfectly time for this class it's from an Iranian analyst now difficult it is to Value companies around I mean there are no markets you can rely on inflation is about 20 he said and his email basically said I keep getting really low values for every company I value and he described what he was doing he said I'm using you know with the inflation rate my discount rate is 20 22 23 and he was using the high discount rate then he got to the terminal value stage he was using a three percent growth rate and he explained why three percent he said the long-term growth rate in the Iranian economy is about three percent a year which actually is not a bad estimate if you're talking about real growth the three percent was a real growth rate the discount rates are all nominal growth rates you mismatch the numbers you're going to significantly undervalued company so what should he what what do you think my my advice to him was what did I you know what are the two ways he can fix it comes right after the quiz so you should be able to tell me I can either make my nominal discount rate into a real discount rate which would make the 25 into seven or eight percent even with country risk or I can take my three percent growth rate add the inflation to it and use an eighteen percent eighteen percent growth rate forever you have 18 inflation or twenty percent inflation you can have an 18 growth rate forever your valuation is not going to blow up because your discount rate is also going to rise for those companies so people act like this terminal value somehow set for them it has a lot more Flex than you realize in terms of bringing in the differences across your companies I mean I'm going to ask you what your growth rate is forever starting in 2032. for the entire economy do you guys want to actually be sitting there forecasting what the growth rate in nominal terms is going to be a free account you think why I'll ask a macro Economist why are you wasting your time you know how long it takes macro economists to tell you there was a recession two years after the recession has happened so two years ago there was a recession thank you for letting me know I'll go back and defend myself now that's how long it takes the nber which is the the the the National Bureau of economic research to classify something as a result you can ask these guys what growth will be beyond their 2032. so I've been struggling with a way of estimating growth forever that I don't have to go out and do incredible amounts of research and it's tied to the rest of my valuation so I'm going to show you what I use and I try to justify it because when you use it in your DCFS at work people will say what's the link between these two numbers remember I want to growth rate in perpetuity after 2032 in the same terms that I've done the valuation I'm going to use my risk-free rate as my proxy for that growth rate forever you've already seen me do this when I did implied premium so let me back this up when you look at a risk-free rate in any cards there are two components with this expected inflation and an expected real interest rate it's called the Fischer equation so I'm not inventing things that's my risk created what goes into nominal growth rate in the economy expected inflation and an expected real growth rate so the two equations you set them next to each other one has an expected real interest rate the other is an expected real growth right do you remember what a real interest rate is you remember from econ 101 usually they give examples like apples you borrowed a hundred apples and you're going to see in a minute why it's got to be apples and not dollars and you have to return the apples one year from now you've got to return 102 apples there's a two percent real interest rate real interest rate basically means I'm going to return whatever I borrowed from you with an extra amount on top because I put present consumption over future consumption that's what a real interest rate is so let's say I go around promising people two percent real interest rates but the economy is growing at only one percent collectively we have a problem do you see why because people have promised to deliver two percent more the economy is growing only one percent where's the extra one percent going to come from so real interest rates cannot run ahead of real growth rates because sooner or later the system's going to blow real growth rates can be higher than real interest rates in the near term but over time even that number is going to converge because over time the two numbers can't be out of six and we're talking about forever here so they could be out of sync next year maybe next five years but not forever you're not convinced right so let me give you some numbers to back up why I think the risk-free rate is a good proxy for nominal growth rate so I go back all the way to 1954. and I run an experiment in the first the first part of the experiment asked macro economists to forecast what growth would look like for the next 10 years to get the best macro economists together they make a forecaster growth my alternative is I take the t-bond rate that day and I use it as my forecast for growth for the next 10 days because I remember I said the nominal interest rate is a predictor of growth over the last 70 years the t-bond rate has beaten Economist forecasts and nominal growth as a predictor of growth in the economy you know why you ask an economist what growth is going to be you can make up any number right there's no money behind it the t-bond you're actually putting real money behind the number I'll take a money-backed number over a number that somebody spots off no matter what their expertise is every single time and if you look at this table you can see that between 1950s if you like the entire temperature there's a 10-year t-bond right you take the inflation rate and the real GDP growth rate over the period you can see it's been slightly higher but if you break it down much of that increase came from the first part of the time period 1954-380 the growth ran ahead of risk three rates since 1980 if you look at the growth rate it actually you know between 81 and 2008 ran Below in 2011 so you can see that between periods you can have periods or one runs ahead but if you look at the periods with High T Bond rates you get high growth rates and this is what we talked about in the context of why of interest rates being low for the last decade it's because you've had low inflation and low Railroad so today of course the keyboard rate is four percent if you ask me what's a nominal growth in the U.S economy going to be for the next 10 years not good no Jump Around ask somebody what I'm just going to use the four percent and here's if none of this is convinced you let me give you a final reason why I still think you should connect your growth rate in perpetuity but there is creating it's an issue of consistency no remember that when you get to your terminal value your growth rate pushes up your cash flows and your discount rate is what you discount those cash flows at if I assume a growth rate for the economy that's much higher than the risk-free rate here's what's going to happen my my cash flows are going to grow four percent a year I'm going to be using a one and a half percent D1 rate I can almost guarantee you're going to overvalue a company and the reason you're overvaluing the company is because you're making internally inconsistent assumptions about the economy in your own equation in your numerator you're assuming an economy that's going to grow at four percent in normal terms in your denominator you're assuming an economy that'll go at one and a half percent the reason a lot of people had trouble with low risk free rates over the last decade the most common pushback I would get is with these low interest rates I'm finding everything is is very valuable that shouldn't happen because if you tie the growth rate you risk free rate when one is too low so you need 10 minutes free rates are too low the other is going to be too low as well it basically means that your mistakes will cancel out so if you think risk free rates are too low stick with the low growth rate it'll cancel out if you think risk Creed rates are too high stick with a high growth rate will catch a lot by connecting my growth rate to my risk-free rate I essentially stay consistent and currency takes care of itself right if I am doing my valuation in a high inflation currency my risk free rate is 12 percent I get a lot more leeway in the growth rate I can use a 10 growth rate and get away with it because I'm in a high inflation currency so I know it's a long-winded argument but it's an argument you're going to have because much evaluation people make different assumptions about growth in the numerator and growth in the denominator by using risk three dates that don't match up yes you could as long as you do it to both see that's my point if you want to do this to the numerator then what your risk free rate then has to be estimated the same way you cannot just do this to your numerator and leave your denominator unchanged so if you want to normalize things which is what you're doing effectively then normalize the risk-free rate as well it seems to me that you're going through a lot of trouble with little effect on value because you normalize both guess what's going to happen R minus C right so if R and G both go up the canceling effect will basically mean they're not affecting terminal value that much so why spend your time on an input that's not going to make that much of a difference to your terminal value so that's the first part and I'm the reason I emphasize it so much is people are convinced that it's a huge issue that they have to worry about you'll be amazed at how many how much time people spend on estimating growth rate and perpetuity it's got nothing to do with your company it's got nothing to do with you so in a sense the only place the it'll show up in the other inputs your growth rate and perpetuity it doesn't matter whether you're a special company or a not so special company you don't have much room to run so let's talk about what happens when your risk-free rate turns negative and you're going to see what I mean about staying consistent so the last part of the last decade risk-free rates turned negative in some currencies the Euro for instance is a negative discrete and people said you can't do discounted cash flow valuation anymore and I said why not and the argument was with negative riskery rates you're going to get really low cost of capital is that true absolutely so here's a valuation of Heineken in September of 2019 when the Euro risk free rate was minus 0.5 percent I know some of you are working with negative risk-free rate currencies to kind of hang in there for this valuation so the negative risky rate minus point five percent you started a base of minus point five percent it's going to push down your cost of equity it's going to push down your cost to debt stand up with a cost of capital of 5.04 it's a good news because they have really low the risk-free rate is negative they end up with a really low cost account remember having a negative risk creator doesn't mean you end up with a negative cost of capital you still have risk premiums and spreads you're going to end up with it's going to be a really low number that's a good news saying what's the bad news why would a screen Rich low in Europe because you're deflation at that point in time and real growth looked pretty Abyss now when I forecast numbers for Heineken I've got to keep that in mind right the same forces that keep your risk-free rate negative are also the forces that are going to drive your cash flows so I was conservative in the growth rate that I was estimating I think the growth rate I estimated was 3.22 here but here's the number that that when I presented I actually presented this to an audience where there were four people from heineken's Finance group in the audience I got to my terminal value I said I'm going to give you a minus point five percent growth rate forever I'm at the cap is risk created they freaked out they said that's terrible it means and they said you didn't complain with now you used a negative risk free rate to come up with the across to Capital right if you use a negative risk credit to come up with a low costed Capital this is the other shoe waiting to drop saying they said can we use a three percent growth rate in perpetuity I said you can but here's what you need to change that you want to use a three percent growth rate in perpetuity what will they need to do to stay consistent they need to go in and recompute a cost to Capital after year 10 using a three percent risk free rate and if you do that then I'm okay with it this is one of the second last questions in the fcff simple cancer spreadsheet I put it in because the days of low interest rates because people say what if I think t-bond rates are going to go up I said that's fine that put in a higher T bond rate put in a higher growth rate I can live with that but you can't change one without thinking about the other it's internal consistency that gets people internal inconsistency that gets people into trouble so don't give up just because risk-free rates are low luckily the promise passed for you because a year ago people are complaining about how low the people under it is notice there's nobody complaining today it probably coming late looks a little high no stop complaining about rates they are what they are build them in set a growth rate cap based on the same rate move on I want you to think about your company not about interest rates and inflation and the macro factors I wanted to focus in on the company second don't wait too long to put your company into stable growth I mean often your growth rate might be ten percent when will my company become a mature company mature company is a rate that grows mature companies one that grows at a rate less than or equal to the economy and also remember growth has value only if you earn excess returns over and above the cost account so if you take your company is in a comparative business and excess returns are going to disappear after year three you might as well stop right growth is not adding value it's just it's just a mechanical thing you're throwing in it it increases your earnings but it also increases your reinvestment the two offset each other so one of the questions in looking at when you value your company is what kind of company am I what business am I in what are the competitive advantages what are the barriers to entry in this business remember I said every number has a story behind it and that's something you have to make a judgment on your company so when you look at how long a company can know companies with strong and sustainable comparative advantages can have much longer growth periods in companies without those competitive advantages I mean that requires some some but I'll give you a couple examples right look at a company like Groupon I remember when it went public it went with the blaze of glory it's high Growth Company you know people attaching High values I never understood the basis for those valuations and here's what I never understood and I still don't understand what group wants competitive advantages when they went public you know what the competitive Advantage was that they found my email before somebody else and then they sent me an email saying I have a deal of the day and I said what's going to stop a dozen other companies from sending a deal of the day you guys get dealer I get at least a dozen deals of the day today Groupons growth rate very quickly faded because it had no barriers to enter you know often we look at past growth where Dazzle bypass growth but the question you've got to ask is what's special about this company be a Kevin O'Leary right that's basically you know no matter how the growth rate of the company is always convinced that everything is overvalued that you should never pay for more but it's a good question to ask what's special about your company don't tell me about growth because that's the easy part tell me what makes your company unique so as you think about growth I want you to think about how long that will be and for some companies you might say the competitive Advantage is strong and sustainable I'm going to go with 20 years and that's going to be a special company and for some companies let's say it's going to fade in three years because that's what's going to determine when you can stop and compute a terminal value I know in the fcff Ginza you're kind of constrained to 10 years for every company but remember you can make your growth rate equal to the growth rate of the economy at the risk-free rate by year five and make it a mature company after year five so you have the mechanism to do it indirectly in the veterans now when we talked about growth one of the points I emphasize is growth is not free you've got to reinvest to get growth and especially in the terminal value calculation that becomes critical because all the excuses are gone for growth without reinvestment right like what if I ask you why is your growth high for the next three years you can talk about becoming more efficient cutting costs so care for the next five years next three years but when you get to your terminal value calculation you can't use that argument anymore why because this is growth forever so even if you don't use the sustainable growth equation for the high growth period when you get to terminal value you have to think about how much you need to reinvest to get the growth rate and that's basically what the start of the class test made you think about is if I bring in a growth rate how much will I need to reinvest and how much I need to reinvest will be a function of what kind of return on Capital I will earn in perpetuity so in fact here I've taken a company and for different returns in capital computed what the effect will be on Terminal value of using growth rates from zero to three percent let's take the middle column when my return on capital is 10 changing my growth rate is Zero Effect on Terminal value if the growth rate is less than 10 percent increasing my growth rate actually lowers terminal value if my return capital is greater than 10 percent it increases terminal value you think what's so special about 10 that's my cost of capital if my return in capital and stable growth is equal to my cost of capital you might as well set the growth rate to zero it is having it's having no effect on your tone so this is an assumption I'm asking you to make and you're saying what should I base it on if your company is in a business where it's really difficult to earn more than the cost of capital automobiles historically companies have had a tough time earning more than the cost of capital comparative businesses then when you get to terminal value you're probably safest assuming return on capital is equal to the cost of capital if your company is in a bad business brick and mortar retail and it insists on growing then my suggestion is set the return Capital less than the cost of capital because growth will actually destroy value but if your company has some special advantages that you think will last last long time like branding consumer products with brand names have huge sustainable competitive advantages technology companies companies with networking benefits then you might set the return capital above the cost to Capital and be okay with it because you're saying this business is a business where you can maintain excess returns for really long periods a first book and valuation came out in the 19 I think late 1980s and at the same time until that book came along you know you had Ben Graham's Security analysis there weren't any evaluation books but John Wiley that published my book also published a book by Mackenzie on valuation they both came out at the same time and if any of you have seen the McKinsey book evaluation they used no plat which is their after tax operating income just a different term they use and in the terminal value calculation this might be have changed in a more recent Edition the original Edition the terminal value is no plat divided by cost of capital there was no G in the equation and I'd get all these emails from people at that time you can get emails to get snail mail from people reading the book saying well I've been reading the McKinsey book and I noticed that they don't have a g in their terminal value calculation can you tell me what twitch my response should have been want to write to McKenzie and ask a question it's not my but actually if you read the McKinsey book at least the early editions they made the Assumption and they still do I think in their DC evaluations that once you become a mature company you cannot earn more than your cost of capital that that's their definition of a mature company and once you make that assumption you see why the G disappears because putting in a g is going to have no affected value might as well use a zero growth so McKenzie's argument no company can earn more than the costly Capital forever so we're going to assume and that's technically true but McKenzie's own Research indicates that they might be on some weak ground on this assumption the magazine called McKinsey quarterly which is you know you can if you subscribe to the kids you can actually get it for free I'd strongly recommend you you get it because they do some really good work that's useful from a pragmatic perspective and one of the papers in that in the Mackenzie quarterly looked at two things one is what happens to growth rates for companies if you track them over time and they're no surprise as you track companies growth rates over time they tend to decrease towards the growth rate of the economy so we're backing for that but they also look at what happens to companies Returns on Capital if you track them over time and guess what if you look at returns and capital they're much more persistent in other words you take a company with a 15 return on Capital you track it over time you don't see the return on Capital drifting down that fast to the cost of capital that's actually evidence against the McKenzie practice of assuming every company so I'm not saying every company should assume above the cost of capital but you should be looking at the percent Persistence of return Capital to your company but consistently earns 18 20 22 percent give it a high return on Capital and terminal value above the cost of capital because there's something that this company has some competitive advantage that's not going to fail that way now of course as I said this is terminal values where people do some really absurd things and get away with it so let's say you it's a year and a half I think most of your Juniors right you're not graduating at the end of this year no so you're in three months from now you're graduating you've ended up in a discounted cash flow valuation job at a bank at a consulting firm is all the analyst comes across and he says you know what an unstable growth and I'm going to list out the things and this is not uncommon many PCs you'll see this you say now I'm going to assume that the company mature companies capex will offset depreciation they'll call it maintenance capex or something like that capex offsets depreciation so what's net capex going to be zero they're walking no working capital needs which means working capital change is zero what's zero plus zero zero so you have a zero reinvestment rate and now comes the magical part they'd say but the company can grow at the inflation rate still you see the logic here right because you're growing at the inflation rate you don't need to build additional capacity and because you don't need to build additional capacity why do you need reinvestment there's something wrong with this logic and I want you to tell me what that is because it sounds awfully alluring right you're just having inflation growth you don't need to produce more units so why would I need net capex what is wrong with this argument because that basically means you can use a two percent growth rate in perpetuity with zero reinvestment you take old machines and you replace them with newer machines right so even if you maintain a factory you're basically replacing old equipment with new equipment you assume the two percent inflation rate when you did your revenues right so if you're being consistent when you take that million dollar machine from 10 years ago and you replace it with a new machine today guess what it's going to cost you more to replace it so even though you're maintaining capacity in a world with inflation maintaining capacity will require a netcat There Is No Escape Hatcher you want to put in growth you need to think about reinvestment I don't care whether the growth is inflation growth or it's real growth the reinvestment is going to come no matter what the reason is for your growth right it's just going to take a different form so that's a sleight of hand you will see that many analysts use this I'm a mature company I have a two percent growth rate but because I'm a mature company growing at the inflation rate I don't need net capex I don't need a change in working capital your answer is no way if you wanted two percent growth rate you need to think of red reinvestment you can make an argument that replacing machines is a higher return in capital project I'm willing to give you a 20 return on Capital if need be but I'm not going to assume you can get away without reinvesting money so let's see where we are you get the Perpetual growth make sure your growth rate does not exceed the growth rate of the economy second we said don't wait too long to make your company mature Growth Company third make sure you're reinvesting enough to assist any growth rate and final point to remember is if you're going to make your company a mature company give it the characteristics of a mature company you see what are you talking about let's say any of you valid Young Money losing companies okay so you have a Young Money losing company just give me a sense of numbers are you going to end up with a high cost of capital and you start the valuation or a low cost account Young Money losing Company stock you're going to end up with a high cost of capital why because they're risky they're often are Niche business they don't have much debt it's all Equity funded the equity might be risky High Cost of capital in your spreadsheet I'm not saying you've done the valuation what do you hope to do to your Young Money losing company first you want to make small into large revenues you're going to make the money losing into money making which I'm not gonna I mean that's the whole point of evaluation but as your company gets larger and becomes a money-making company what should happen to its cost of capital it should decrease towards that in other words if you keep your cost to Capital at 15 which is what you have in year one and you make your company into a money making bigger company you're being internally consistent you're fighting Your Own Story so here's what I would expect to see with the young growth companies you might start at 15 but as your company gets bigger and more profitable I'd expect the 15 to drift down towards a caustic capital of the average company in fact that's a default built into your spreadsheet is we don't pick a number I will push your cost to Capital down over time or push it up over time from either direction towards the median cost of capital of a typical company so as your company matures I'd expect its cost of capital to approach that of a typical company what will happen to its reinvestment rate as you go through time your growth is decreasing so you should reinvest less I'd expected reinvestment to change even the return on Capital you start off you might have a niche business you might earn a great return on Capital but over time as you get bigger that number is you know each of the numbers we think about in value you get another shot when you get to stable growth that's why I ask you to revisit those numbers rather than taking today's numbers because this is 10 years out a very that's the same name as your company today but it's a very different company so internal consistency basically means adjusting your numbers to make them more reflective of the company that you have on your spreadsheet a low growth high margin company which is one reason if you ever see a young company evaluation with one cost to Capital as a discount rate of attack you already should be skeptical about the valuation because that is not internally consistent to tell me that your company is going to go from high growth to low growth from money losing to money making but leave the cost to Capital It Whatever It Is so now let's bring it all together we've talked about all of the inputs evaluations started with discount rates and we moved to cash flows and we talked about growth rates basically all of the numbers according to DCF for that right so here comes the last part if you're building your own model I've done this work for you but I'm going to give you a sense if you're building your own model how would you design the right model for your company so let's start with the First Choice you have to make you can either value the equity in the business or you can value the business remember you talked about two about 90 percent of my valuations are value the business only 10 Equity evaluation let me explain why when you have a the cases when you value Equity are the cases where you don't have a choice valuing a bank you know if you saw my JP Morgan valuation I value the equity because you can't value the business there's no because debt to a bank is not really a source of capital it's raw material so some cases you have no choice but when you make that choice between valuing equity of the firm one of the things you might want to look at is which remember if you do it right you get the same value using both the proteins right so it's a pragmatic question which is easier to do so let's think about value Equity I need free cash flows to equity pre-casters Equity are after debt payments to Value The Firm I need pre-dead cash flows when you have a company if you remember the free cash flow Equity calculation there was a shortcut where you could use to get the free cash flow Equity we multiplied the net capital that shortcut worked only if you had a mature company with a stable debtor issue a mature company the stable debt ratio it's equally easy to estimate free cash flow Equity free cash flow but let's say you a firm that is no debt today but expects to be at a 30 debt ratio 10 years from now it's easy to adjust the cost of capital changing debt ratios between just the cash flows you got to estimate how much debt is going to be raised each year how much debt is going to be repaid it's much more difficult estimating free cash flows to equity when Leverage is changing then it is to estimate discount rates so here's the shortcut you're looking at your firm and saying it has a debt ratio of 10 I have no idea what's going to happen to it over time or it's going to increase over time then stick with a firm valuation it's easier to get the cash flows it's easier to adjust your cost to Capital changing debt ratios but if you have a mature firm but the debtoration has been pretty stable then you're indifferent between the two if you are in any doubt go with the firm valuation so if you're in any doubt at all that's why 90 of my valuations become firm valuations but if you decide to go the equity route what are the choices you have what are the two things you can do you can use the dividend discard model right where you just take whatever the company pays out or you can estimate your free cashword Equity potential dividend again I'll make it easy if you can estimate free cash flowed Equity do not use the dividend discount model I do not want to see any of you using a dividend discount model in a manufacturing company or Service Company you can estimate free cash card equity re-cashcode equities what you can actually pay out why focus on this artificial number that companies actually do I think whenever I ever use the dividend discount model when you cannot estimate free cash flow equity when will you not be able to estimate free cash flow Equity think of what you need to get to free cash Equity start with net income then you subtract out net capex and you subtract our change in working capital most manufacturing companies you can get those but for a bank what is net capex what is change in working capital the dividend discount models last Bastion post Financial Service firms and part of the reason people used it was they threw up there and said I don't know what the free cash flow equities later in this class I'll give you a way of estimating free cash flows equity for a bank but for the moment if you're valuing a bank or you're adding a financial service company that's a one place where you can use a dividend discount model I'm going to let it go for the moment because you really are doing it because you cannot estimate precautions equity so you pick the cash flow to Discount and you basically decide between the two models once you pick between equity and firm your discount rate gets picked for you right because we decide to Discount dividends of free cash with Equity a discount rate has to be the cost of equity if you're discarding pre-dead cash flows your discount rate is the cost of capital so it's not like you have a choice once you pick what cash flow to discount and then you can do subtests right if you're doing everything in real terms you could use a real discount rate if you're doing in dollar terms so make sure you're being internally consistent so when you think about customer so when you think about what model let me give you a very broad template but deciding what to do with the economy if you have a large firm that is growing at a rate less than or equal to the economy you're valuing Verizon I'm not pre-charging you you know it's likely that you're going to get a growth rate less than or equal to the growth rate of the economy it's constrained from growing much faster the old regulated monopolies used to have constraints on them or as a character and but it also has to have the characteristics of a mature like what's caustic Capital should be pretty close the average it should be you know not at a zero debt ratio so in a sense if everything has settled in there's no reason why you cannot value a company with three numbers the expected cash flow next year the cost of capital and the growth rate just use the terminal value equation today there's no need to project our 10 years of numbers if nothing is changing will that be possible for some of your companies you might think you hit Pay Dirt if you found one of these companies and it you have it paid out in terms of how much work is involved in evaluation but this is a valuation where you learn very little Beyond doing it but do it and pick another company to actually do a DCM if you have a company that is large and growing at a rate higher than the growth rate of the economy by a little bit more five six seven eight percent a lot of larger company like Coca-Cola You could argue are not quite stable yet but they're getting close to that point then I think you should at least have a window where you allow the company to grow at a rate faster than the economy three years five years and then you could put your company into stable growth I call these two-stage models a stage of high growth and then you become a mature company more generically though if you have a company that's going at 20 or 30 percent you don't want to make that growth rate go to the growth rate of the economy in year six because that's a big so what you do is you introduce a transition periods fancy word for I'm going to get them from twenty percent to three percent over five years or ten years generically every discounted cash flow model that's what you're doing you're either a mature company already you have a two-stage model three-stage model you can even have an end stage model you have a growth rate that varies every year eventually in all of these these models you end up with stable growth but the question how you get there so I'm going to close the picture I think of yeah but in the high growth but then bring in all the characteristics right bringing the costs of being in that risky venture to reinvest with it you know what it'll mean is you you you're you'll be less able to use historical numbers in your forecast their historical reinvestment rate historical return Capital the historical cost of capital all have to get reassessed because this company is changing its business model today I'm going to introduce growth but that growth might be more likely to destroy value than add value if they're entering a business that they have no business entering into so I think of discounted cash flow models as Legos we know you've ever played with Legos think of three Lego boxes you got the discount rate box the cash flow about the growth pattern box and you're trying to fit them together every DCF model is a is a combination of choices of what cash flows you're discounting dividend free cash flow Equity free cash for the firm what discount rate goes and remember some Lego pieces don't fit together so you can't take a cost of equity and force it on a pre-dead cash flow and finally what growth pattern do you pick for your company now that's why I've never understood people who claim proprietary dividend discount models Sanford Bernstein which is well-known research firm for the longest time at patented a two-stage dividend discount model shows you could patent pretty much anything what the heck did you patent that you invented dividends went to two stages no there's nothing patentable about a discounted cash flow model it's basic mechanics but people who invest the HM they're all these variants I've invented a new DCF model no you haven't gives us put the Lego pieces together in a different way everything here is building off the same ingredients so now you think you're done right you got cash flows you got the discount rate let's say you've done everything we've done so far you've got the terminal value you got it all right you come up with the present value you say ah thank God I'm done this is where the real damage gets done I'm going to call it tying up loose sets now you know how Academia works let me tell you I work incredibly hard like they make me work like four and a half hours a week for like 38 weeks they give me only 17 weeks off every year or 16 weeks and because I work so incredibly hard every seventh year I get the entire year off with pay it's got a sabbatical if you're sorry for me already right so I've had over my my law because I've been here 38 years I've had five sabbaticals and usually people have big plans for their sabbaticals they're going to write a book they're going to do papers this is I think 2007 or 2008 as sabbatical is coming up and I had a singular objective I said I'm going to spend 365 days doing absolutely nothing I want to wake up every day with a to-do list with nothing to do so I was a little ostentatious about it I went to Staples and I bought one of those boards with to-do's on them I got home I stuck it over my my corner of the home I'd have an actual office and I would I put it up there and as my kids came down they were all at home still going to school as they came down to go to school I pointed to my to-do list and said nothing to do today God pissed them off no end but they left then I made my fatal mistake my wife came down the stairs they said hon I have nothing to do today she said really want to take the dog for a walk so I took the dog for a walk I come back to something on my to-do list so what the heck is this my plans will be broken on day one said pick up bok choy at the grocery store I had no idea what Bok chai even was I was too embarrassed to ask I spent like two hours wandering around finally I found it this ugly looking cabbage it's really good I come back home there's another item on the to-do list pick up kids from school so after by the third or fourth item that showed up on my to-do list I said I need something to do to keep my wife off my to-do list I'm really desperate so coincidentally I get an email from the editor of CFA magazine which I've never heard of but never heard of the editor he said can you write a one-page article for the CFA magazine my first reaction would be I want nothing to do but then I remembered I needed things to do to keep my wife excited said okay and then I put in big words you know writing one page article for CFA magazine cannot pick up bok choy kids etc etc etc and I spent the next week writing this one page article and I've tell you the only thing I've ever written in valuation that's got me hate mail you know how difficult it is to get hate mail in valuation nobody's ever said I hate you for using bottom-up errors they don't feel strongly enough about it but part of the reason I got hate mail was the title of the article is stop the garnishing and I was talking about the practice and valuation where people who do evaluation then add 20 for control knock off 25 for liquidity and I said if you do this and I might have used the word arbitrary to describe these premiums and discounts you're going to end up wherever you want to in the first place because you're just going to find a mechanical way to get there they get this wave of hate mail and then I get this one email that actually made a good point they said if you and mostly these are from private company appraisers where there's a lot of discounting and premium they said if you don't like the way we're doing this evaluation why don't you come up with a better way I said you're right I have 11 months left in my sabbatical here's what I'm going to do every month I'm going to pick up a loose end something that people attach a premium or a discount to and talk about how I would go about valuing that looser so control everybody attaches a 20 premium I can see where you get it but if you're doing this right how would you value control so week three month three liquidity you know everybody talks about liquidity knock off 25 from value why 25 why not 15 why not 35. so each month I picked a different Lucid so there went my plan to do nothing for a year but it's actually one half of one of my valuation books the modern evaluation which is really a practitioner book for private appraisers the second half of the book is all about all these loot sets so I'm going to give you a very Speedy run through on some of these Loose Ends so here are some of the things I want to talk about I want to talk about the practice we have in valuation after you've done your DC evaluation of adding on cash and marketable security standard practice right you do a discounted cash flow evaluation you add cash on I'm going to ask a question are there conditions where you might discount cash in the hands of some companies or attach a premium I want you to start thinking about that and why would you do that I want to talk about cross Holdings where you hold three percent five percent ten percent of another company in a perfect world how would you Value Cross Holdings in the world we're in where information is not always available what do you do about cross-sortics what about other stuff what if my company has vacant Real Estate in Manhattan can even have vacant real estate but let's say you have land in Manhattan that you're not using but you own it should I be adding that on to my DC evaluation I want to talk about hey what's the value of control in a world where control actually matters so in other words each of these I'm going to go back and talk about what practitioners do and what we might think about doing differently to get a better judgment on what's what so I want to start with cash we know the conventional practice with cash is a hundred dollars in cash how much is it worth don't play games it's worth a hundred dollars sloppy sometimes in discarded cash flow evaluation basket have you valued cash it's amazing how often you know I have no idea but in a way we do this is we keep cash separate from our operating assets we get the free cash for the firm we discount the cost of capital we add cash at the end because we've kept it separate when you're doing a free cash rate Equity valuation all bets are off right if you start with net income in a sense you've already Incorporated cash into your cash flows you can't add cash on because then you might be double County cash so we are sloppy but we think we know what to do cash is Cash I'm going to add the value of cash so I'm going to start with a question I want you to think about this from an instinctive standpoint don't think in terms of models I'm going to show you three companies three companies at the same Enterprise Value so I've got the same DCF value by discounting free cash for the form of the cost of capital all three of a hundred million dollars in cash in hand and your job is to Value the cash so forget about the Enterprise level let's suppose that's right they all have 100 million cash seems like a stupid question they're all 100 million in cash should be worth 100 million in every company let me add some details about these three companies company a is a us-based company earned the return on capital of ten percent it's cost to capitalist ten percent Company B is also us-based company as a return capital of five percent across the capital of ten percent company C is an Argentine company and it's a return on capital of 22 and a cost to Capital of 12 percent I'm going to argue that in one of these three companies cash is a neutral asset you know what I mean by neutral asset 100 million cash is going to be valued at 100 million in one of these three companies I'm going to attach a discount to the cash and one of these three companies I'm going to attach a premium to the cash let's start with the easy one in which of these three companies is Cash most likely to be a neutral asset and what is it about a that makes it a neutral asset it's a Blog company what do blog companies do they don't help you they don't hurt you they kind of run in place but before you complain about block companies there are Fades far worse than investing in a blog company so let me ask you about the company where you're most likely to attach a discount to the cash and why which of these three companies you're most likely to attach a discount to the cash environment you don't trust those argentines right they kind of drink and they play games see what is it about C that worries you but they're only going to return it so they have a higher cost of capital they're earning a return on Capital exceeds it so unless you say I don't trust Argentine accounting which might be legitimate Target they're still earning more than the cost of capital they're finding good projects even though they're in a risky part of the world right so you're assuming that there are projects out there Apple earns 35 return Capital it's cost to capitalist 10 percent why can't it keep taking projects it's not like they have an infinite number of projects that return Capital right what is it about Company B that should bother you they have a history of stupidity you know what you're doing you're attaching a stupidity discard you're saying these managers are so stupid that if I give them a hundred million cash guess what they're going to find they're going to find more bad Investments I know it's a very cynical perspective but it's a realistic one companies that have a history of taking bad Investments are not going to magically stop to discounting the cash for the fact that you don't trust these guys with your cash company C I'll tell you why I might attach a premium I should have put in some other Market other than Argentina I'll tell you in a minute why normally in traditional Corporate Finance no company needs a cash balance you know why if you have a great project in utopian Corporate Finance what do we assume we can do go out and raise Capital take the project what's the big deal so in markets where capital is always easy and accessible companies don't need to maintain cash balances you see why I picked Argentina as my company then the last 20 years there have been at least five times when Argentine Capital markets have completely Frozen up not just Equity markets but Bank Stop lending money if you're in a crisis can you see the advantage of having a cash balance in a country like Argentina because in that crisis what does that cash balance allow you to do now not just survive through the crisis but gives you a strategic weapon you can use to buy other companies assets because those companies are desperate for cash you might attach a premium to the cash because cash becomes a useful weapon allows you to survive and it's not just across countries like a young company with a big cash balance it's a good thing to have a cash balance because what are you worrying about all your values in the future but if you don't make it to year three you're never going to see it cash might actually work in your favor mistake I made was I made it an Argentine company I was in Brazil and I gave 300 Brazilians in a room this example I think 250 of them picked the third corporate companies here said why turns out that Brazilian lost to Argentina and a soccer match the previous weekend they were really pissed off they said he can't trust those argentines it's a cultural fights playing out soccer battles being lost here but you can see why the value of a dollar in cash can vary across so when you think about why you discount cash it's not because cash earns a low rate of return how about analysts complain oh cash is a bad investment cash is a neutral investment cash invested in table is a commercial paper is a zero Net Present Value investment taking that cash and taking buying taking a project that makes seven percent might actually make you worse off if the cost of capital of that project is nine percent it's what you do with the cash that terrifies me and in the hands of some managers you can see why I work so here's a you know for the longest time people have talked about this but there's no evidence to back it up because people said do markets actually do this do they actually discount cash we have some evidence that they do it's actually from perhaps one of the most Creative Studies I've ever seen what the study looked at was how much is a dollar in cash in the hands of a U.S company valued at by the market I started the good news across all companies a dollar in cash is valued at a dollar 1.03 now I know it's roughly a dollar you know why that's good news right because that's what we do in every DCF we add the entire cash balance but when they looked at mature companies with negative access returns you know what I mean by negative excess returns they're like Company B they earn less than the cost of capital a dollar in cash is valued at 69 cents a 31 discount you're a company with a bad history of taking projects you have 10 billion in cash the market acts like you're only 6.9 billion you guys have heard of Carl icad right Carl icat is not the deepest thinker on the face at the end so one trick pony there's a classic I can't talk he picks a Target says you have too much cash give me the cash you see how did he get so rich he picks the right companies you see why targeting these mature companies where the market is discounting the cash gives you almost instantaneous payoff because you return the cash what happened to the discard it's gone if people don't trust you with the cash holding on to the cash will actually mean you get a lower value all you need to do is give back the cash BuyBacks dividends I don't care the discount disappears if you pick a high growth companies that earn more than the cost of capital you actually find that on average these companies are dollar in cash it's valid at a dollar 22. so if you're valuing a young company it's a big cash balance that's not a bad thing it might allow them to survive the next downturn allow them to survive to get to your three year four year five which is when the magical things happen right margins improve growth rates go up so it's there's nothing I want you to do specifically now about cash balances but if you have a company where a big chunk of its value comes from its cash balance there are companies out there with 20 of the value Nintendo for the longest time half the value of Nintendo came from its cash balance then you might want to stop and ask is this the kind of company where the market doesn't trust the company or the cash because when you find the company to be undervalued it might just be because the big cash balance is being discounted by the company and unless you have a call I can on the horizon that discount will not be triggered for you which makes you less likely to invest in a Japanese company than in the U.S company because that kind of activism is more difficult in Japan than it is it'll make you less likely to invest in a company with two classes of shares because there again it's going to be much more difficult to get the company to do the right thing be closed with uh example and I'll build on this further so we discount cash because cash is a you know you expect cash to actually earn a rate of return less than the cost of counter you know you've heard Everybody Hurts you know I'm sure it's heard of mutual funds mutual funds collections have stopped most of the mutual funds out there are open and mutual funds what does that mean you send money to Fidelity Magellan the fund itself grows and every you basically get whatever the value the fund is divided by the number of units so basically the net asset values whatever the market value of the Securities is divided by the number of people it's an old that's a traditional fund there's a subset of mutual funds called closed and mutual funds These funds actually trade in the market as companies so their companies and all of their assets are actually publicly traded equities this should be the easiest of all companies to Value right they're all publicly traded equities if nothing else you can take the the market cap of each of those equities add them up there's the value of this company should trade at roughly that number right a typical closed debt fund trades at a discount of about 15 to 20 percent on its Fair on on that market value the Securities that it holds and this in in corporate finance you know a lot of papers the papers are all titled the closed and fund anomaly the closed end fund plus you see why it's labeled a puzzle right if your market value the Securities orders are 100 million you trade at 80 million as a market cap seems like an easy way to make money and what's what should you do to make money buy the the shares at 80 assuming you don't push it up right after you buy all of the shares you liquidate the company which you're allowed to do as the owner of the company you'll get a hundred million you should be able to claim the 20 million dollar difference so that's the puzzle why don't why do closed debt funds continue to exist why don't people just buy them and liquidate them and about 20 of closed in funds do get liquidated but 80 percent of them persist so next class when we start we're going to talk about why do closed-in funds usually trade at a discount why might they sometimes trade at a premium and it's going to give you a window into Berkshire Hathaway which is an insurance company with a closed and fund that we can talk okay I don't know it's got nothing to do today which means holding on its constant by growth companies should be more effective so the duration we're talking about here is countries because you're enumerator can also changes inflation is kind of a qualified if you holding cash real estate of course high growth companies and to have more available thank you 
so much services thank you okay folks I don't need I don't think you need the reminder that if you don't pick up your quizzes within 10 minutes of this class ending I have to take them back into my office because I've leave them out there during the break God only knows what will happen to them by the damning it back so if you don't want your quizzes I frankly don't care right it you know I know some of you are in denial where if you don't pick up your quiz it's like stroding as cat or whatever the thing is if you don't pick it up it doesn't exist it does exist the grade's been recorded it's not going away the reason I wanted to pick up your quiz is to make sure I haven't screwed up on your grade that's it's purely from your perspective but if you don't pick it up by 5 15 today I will bring it into my office and if you really want to come back after the break and then you know you come and have to ask for it in my office another reminder I know that you're planning great things for your break budget constraint of course now so you're not planning to work on your valuation but if any of you are left desolate and alone in New York and you have nothing to do I have something for you to do take a spreadsheet do the valuation get it done with because when you get back 10 days later it's your feedback date right that that's the point in time by which and I'm not expecting just turn into a spreadsheet that's all you need to turn in it's turning a spreadsheet I'm not expecting because it's purely for feedback but I need that by I think March 31st that Friday whatever I think it is definitely March 31st so that's the date so if you you know if you so what I'm trying to say is if you haven't picked a company what are you waiting for if you picked a company and you haven't entered it into the master list what are you waiting for if you pick the company and enter the master list and you haven't picked up the financial spare company what are you waiting for I said get get at least the start that the process called So today we're going to keep going with the loose sets remember we talked about cash today we're going to talk about more stuff so let's start with the first question one of the things I'm going to ask you about is is complex some companies are easier to Value than other companies and I'm going to present some examples as what what creates complexity but I'm going to give you two companies company a company B first company is in a single business very easy to understand everything is transparent Company B is in multiple businesses and there's opaque financials you know what opaque financials is the annual report claims to be in English but you read it you don't understand a single word of what they say it's written by lawyers for lawyers so you read it and you're completely confused so a simple company complex company as an investor assuming that numbers look similar which of these two companies would you value more highly the simple company the complex company and tell me why anybody you'd pick the more complex company anybody would do go along with complex or pick simple why do you pick the complex company figured so you're saying this could be potentially more risk but remember that's already valued in presumably you built it in so remember you could create something like Company B by buying five companies in different businesses right you can create your own complex near portfolio the question is do you want in one company or do you want to did five different companies [Music] okay let's let's back up what is it about Company B that doesn't scare it there's a lot you don't know right I'll give away with traditional valuation does and why I think we make a mistake in traditional valuation we make the assumption that what you don't know can't hurt you it averages up it's an averaging you take a hundred companies you don't know and know much about any of them there's a advantage of the law of large with ignorance average but there's a problem with that assumption when you have a complex company and managers are not telling you much about the company what are they holding back on good news or bad news or let me phrase it differently when was the last time you woke up to an accounting scan where the company said guys we made five times more money than we told you you had a scandal like that almost always a scandal is on the downside when you get surprises in these companies it's almost always a negative surprise I'm going to give you the time when I started thinking seriously about complexity and what triggered it and how I approach complexity today as part of it but I wanted to start thinking with some of your companies are easier to Value than others you look across your groups I wish I picked that company because you look at your company it's a mess it's got 17 different kinds of bonds it has 15 cross Holdings but some companies are just more difficult to vary more complex than atmosphere let's get going let's suppose you value a company you come up with a value of a hundred million by discounting free cash flows of fur at the cost of capital the company has one Bond outstanding or dead outstanding with a face value of a hundred minute Book value of 100 million but the market value is only 80 million so my question is a very simple one assume the value you put into what's right 100 million for the assets what is the value of your Equity you see the question I'm asking right should you subtract out the 100 million which is what you actually owe in which case your Equity is worth nothing or should you subtract out the 80 million which is the market value of the debt in which case your Equity is worth 20 million if you opened up my book textbook and got to that section you know what I'm going to tell you to do right I'm going to ask you to subtract that market value and tell you the value of equity is 20 million the danger though is when I take a 100 million dollar debt and give it a value of 80 million it's because I think I see more distress more chance you will not make it if that disappears out 80 million is going to go to 100 million the value of your Equity is going to be nothing if somebody acquires this company almost overnight the value record is going to go to zero because the acquirer has a good credit standing that discount will disappear so one of those cases where we use market value of debt all the time to get to Value Equity but I'm saying if you have a company which has which is in distress you're subtracting out market value of debt there is a very real danger in doing that because that market value of debt is discounted from the face value you buy Bed Bath and Beyond you take the debt at market value it's going to be 25 of the book fair treating the difference is the value of equity is it's kind of we do it all the time I'll tell you there's some you know I'll come in and fill in the assumptions we're making but it does make me uncomfortable when I have a distressed company to be subtracting out the market value there so again an issue we come back to as a new set so let's close up this process it says 200 million it should be 20 million no nobody would ever attach a 200 million dollars actually uh the last thing was management options over the last 30 years increasingly companies have turned to giving managers stock based compensation remind me again why companies give stock based compensation I mean 30 years ago managers got paid in cash and bonuses and over the last 30 years there's been a shifted and our management options restricted stock why do companies music what is incentives right which is a noble reason but there's a much more precise reason you go to work for a young tech company why do they have to pay you in options for restrictions they don't have the cash let's be completely honest right and this is going to become the basis for what we think about when we think about what should we do with options I mean incentives are a good thing but the reality is many companies are using stock and options because they don't have the cash to pay their employees it's management compensation and that's going to frame how we think about dealing with those options but let me take a much simpler you know example let's suppose you have 100 million shares outstanding and your value to come value company value the equity in a company at a billion dollars value per share is going to be ten dollars per share right billion divided by 100 million and let's say well you know what I forgot to tell you something sorry about that this company is just granted 10 million options to its CEO and they're at the money options in order we both have any option the strike price is set equal to the ten dollars I have a very simple question about the what this if what the effect would be on your value per share before I told you this what do you value per share it ten dollars per share now we shoot 10 million options that are at the money is your value per share going to be unaffected is it going to go up or is it going to go down they're at the money options right so until the late 90s you know what what accountants did with that the money options they said if they're at the money they're worth nothing it's absurd but that's what they said if you're giving away something worth nothing it'll have no effect on your value per share it is equity investors are you worse off now or better off than you were before in other words the 10 million options are they are they free just because they're at the money what's the essence of an option is you get the right to buy shares at ten dollars if you exercise the option today it's right you're right there's no effect but no management is going to exercise the option today right what are they going to do they're going to sit on the option if the stock price goes to 25 they're going to exercise the option in which case you're selling your shares at a discount to those people that's what an option pricing model is designed to capture and at the money option is not worth nothing So today we're going to talk about how to deal with options outstanding and you can't just adjust the number of shares or treat them based on exercise value which is what a lot of people do you have to think about the value options so lots on our agenda let's go back to where I left you which was I think we were talking about closed and funds the pointed left to it was closed in fronts where essentially all your assets are tradable securities with the market price that they typically trade at the discount of around 15 maybe even 20 on the bed I want somebody to tell me why closed and funds why you discount closed-in funds what's driving it and to give you some background you look to the right I've given you some facts about close inputs when the invest in a closet fund you haven't expected return based on the riskiness of the stocks investment Tech fund and Index Fund let's say that required return is eleven and a half percent let's suppose you have a closed in fund that consistently delivers a half a percent less than that expected return why might that happen why would you be delivering a half a percent less let's say pick stock but you're not very good at picking stocks you just randomly pick stocks you should make eleven and a half percent right so where's the half a percent going it's going into analysts so if you go to work for that closed in front I have to pay you I pay you bonuses I have big buildings I fill the buildings up with people are basically doing nothing other than sucking up value but if you have a fund that consistently delivers less than what it needs to deliver remember with cash we said if you don't make a required return I'm going to discount cash you're going to see the same kind of discount with closed interests so here's the implication if I gave you a hundred closed in funds and I gave you the history of returns I would expect closed and funds that do the worst that have performed the worst to be discounted more than closed-in funds that do much better and you know quite 20 of closed in funds actually trade at a premium why because we earn more than you required return because you got a great manager who picks great stocks guess what you're going to do you're going to take the value of the fund add a premium on not because you think the assets are worth more but because you're paying a premium for the manager I'm going to show you the most famous closed in Fund in history you don't think of it as a closed and fund it's a company called Berkshire Hathaway what's Berkshire Hathaway's Core Business where did they get the capital to invest you see the gecko ads right the Geico is the insurance company Berkshire Hathaway owns it it is an incredibly well-run Insurance Company but if you think about an insurance company what insurance companies do they sell insurance policies they collect premiums those premiums get invested in shares or stock or whatever they want to invest in in a typical insurance company basically got an insurance business and a closed info because the insurance business is how good are you at assessing risk and charging premiums the closed-in fund is how well are you managing that market typical insurance company you really don't get a premium on the closed-in fund side because you have an average manager to judge if you're old state or State Farm and how good is your insurance business but Berkshire Hathaway is different right you're an insurance company with a closed and fund run by the most well-regarded fund manager in history you know with how this manifested itself what do we say about closing funds that deliver more than the expected return they trade at a premium and if you look at you know at Berkshire Hathaway relative to other insurance companies the way they showed up is the price to book ratio for an insurance company and remember for insurance companies book values actually marked to Market so it's basically the market value of reporting you should traded three and a half four times more value the way I used to describe this in the late 90s when I talked about Berkshire Hathaway is we like Coca-Cola as a company and you want to buy it you could pay a price market price but if you bought Coco No Berkshire Hathaway has been one of the largest shareholders in Coca-Cola if you bought books or Hathaway you're buying Coca-Cola at four times the market price because of the buffer premium that was the late 90s Berkshire Hathaway was special that specialness seems to have faded if you look at this graph you can see the price to book ratio has drifted down today Berkshire Hathaway trades at roughly the same price to book ratio in fact a little bit of a discount on a typical Insurance Company the Buffett premium seems to have disappeared why why is there no buffered premium left anymore in Berkshire Hathaway anybody want to try um they can try right who's beating the market What other insurance companies you need to beat the market right it's one of the toughest things to do is to beat the market consistently Warren Buffett earned that reputation the hard way he's getting old we don't have to look far how old is he 91 years old I'm not giving you a secret he's going to die one of these days I'm not being morbid just like we all are and the market knows it you got a 97 year old and Charlie Munger and a 91 year old you know that this is not going to be for much longer and we've known that for a while in fact 10 years ago Warren Buffett told the world that he was passing the Baton you know the 10 years ago he picked these successes taught calms well regard when he said I'm not going to be doing day-to-day stock picking I'm going to let these two guys you know there were two guys so I'm not being sexist you know pick stocks you've ever heard from them it's still Buffett and manga right the reality is this is not something you can pass on to somebody else no matter who you are the Buffett premium is fading because he's getting older expected there are other forces that are affecting value investing but that's at the core of The Disappearance of the premium so when you look at Berkshire Hathaway if you get a chance take think of it that way as an insurance company with a closed and funded kind of changes your perspective on what what the company has to do to kind of get back its Glory so today I know one of the things that people complain about is book Shadow has a lot of cash it doesn't seem to be investing the cash and you know what maybe you don't want them to invest the cash it's a very average company in terms of what it earns and returns and maybe the best thing to do is not push the envelope and try to do things just because you think you can deliver Returns the way you used to so that's catch any questions on cash or closely helicopters let's move on to the second loser talk about crosswords first step in understanding cross Holdings is understanding how accountants deal with Crossroads and it's a mess there are three ways in which class cross Holdings can be classified the first you own three four five percent of a company and you take no role in how that company is run it's called a minority passive investment in the second you own 15 of a company you have a director on the board you have some saying how the companies run it's called a minority active investment and we owed 60 of our company it's called a majority investment so let's look at how the accounting works with each of these if you have a minority passive investment the three four five percent no save that companies right here's what you're required to report in your income statement you have to show the dividends you receive on that holding let me repeat that again you show the dividends you receive and on your balance sheet you have to show what you originally invested to get the three or four or five percent I'll give you an example of how disconnected the numbers you're going to see in the financial statements will be from reality there was a version of softback from way back in time the late 90s where at one point in time I think in 97 and 98 half of softbanks value came from one holding it had its company it was an investment they made in another company called Yahoo that had taken off it become a hundred billion dollar company So Soft Banks holding in Yahoo was worth about seven billion dollars in half the value of SoftBank as a company let's say you're an analyst looking at softbanks income State he was classified as a minority passive investment what do they have seen from that from that Yahoo what does it say you have to report dividends on the board right you know what dividends Yahoo paid in the 1990s nothing you'd have seen nothing you see that's okay I'll go look in the balance here in the balance sheet you've seen a 50 million dollar value for the Yahoo World completely disconnected from the 7 billion because they were reporting what they originally invested as a venture capitalist minority passive Investments what you see on the Financial Group where no resemblance to reality because of the way it's accounted then you get to minority active Investments 15 of another company you have to use What's called the equity approach what's the equity approach in your income statement you have to show 15 of the net income or net loss better than dividends at least you're Translating that through and in your balance sheet you have to show what you originally invested plus or minus 15 the retained earnings sets it's like an updated book bag better right and then you get to a 60 holding accountants flip out what do you require to do both IFRS and GAP when you own 60 of another company consolidate and have never understood the logicals help me out here so when I do my income statement I look at revenues and consolidation what am I required to show a hundred percent of the subsidiaries revenues you need to tell the account and I own only sixty percent the importance is don't worry about it don't worry about it I get to the balance sheet account 100 the cash I hold them at least 60 the account is don't worry about it then at the end of the process he wakes up and says you own only 60 and say what do you think I've been trying to tell you all this time you don't own 40 percent yeah we have to show the 40 that doesn't belong to you because it doesn't belong to you so you know what ends up happening on your balance sheet because you acted like you owned a hundred percent of a subsidiary they're already 60 of you to show the 40 that doesn't belong to you person which side of the battleship asset libraries short as a liability because you counted 100 you call it minority interest or non-consolidated they give it a fancy name you have no idea what it is but there is Big item on the other side it's a residue of consolidation and now we've added layers to this when you have a joint venture some joint ventures qualify what's called proportional consolidation which means you can't only the 55 that's your share of the joint venture if you hold something for trading you have to mark to Market so some cross Holdings are marked the market so soft bank now is covered by rules where every quarter they have to mark the market what I'm trying to say in a long-winded way is if you have accompanied lots of cross-oldings the first thing to understand is the accounting of those Crossroads and it's not easy I've had companies where this has been my biggest roadblock is figuring out how are companies recording cross Holdings because without knowing it I don't even know what to do with those numbers so let's talk about how you would value cross-solidics in a perfect world the word where you could ask for whatever you wanted here's Howard Valley crossovers at first value the company that has the cross sortings just the parent company part I'll give it the growth cash flows risk that reflects the parent company then I take each cross holding in the company and valued separately with its own cash flows growth and risk survive a U.S company with a Japanese subsidiary I can value the US company dollars the Japanese company and I get complete flexibility I don't care whether it's a minority holding or a majority holding because in the end here's what I do I take the parent company value and then I take 10 percent of company a and 15 of Company B and sixty percent of companies say I add them all together and I've got an intrinsic value of a company with its crossovers sounds messy right so I'm going to give you an example from 2013 or 2014 I valued yeah Yahoo 2014 had just you know they had a new CEO and Marissa Meyer she'd come out from Google great reputation was going to turn the company around and I value the company in three parts first I took Yahoo as an operating company and Yahoo is an operating company and not much to show right search engine that had faded Google had dominated the business I came up with the value it was a pretty generous valuation of about 7.4 billion for Yahoo the parent company this is just a search engine to email the traditional Yahoo the bulk of Yahoo's value though came from two cross Holdings one was a 35 share of Yahoo Japan which was a standalone publicly traded company the Japanese still seemed to like Yahoo for whatever reason so I valued Yahoo Japan again an intrinsic valuation and I came up with a value of equity by looking at the 35 of that intrinsic value you know the other crosswording was it's a 22 stake in Alibaba this was right as they'd filed the prospectus for their IPO so I valued Alibaba as a standalone company with its own cash flows growth and risk and took 22 percent of that yep I used this is why I had to wait for the prospectus to be fought this was done at the time they filed the prospectus to go public in fact I'm glad you brought that up until they did that I wouldn't have been able to do an intrinsic valuation of Alibaba so once a prospectus got filed I was able to get my hands on the numbers but that's part of the reason I had to wait because if I'd done this before I'd have had to use some estimates of revenues to make a pricing Alibaba but the prospectus was what triggered my being able to complete this is 14. this was actually towards the middle of 2014 I don't know what the right so it was actually the I know the timing of this particular valuation was right after the prospectus came out before they actually went to the market they actually went public at about 200 billion so my estimate of intrinsic value reflected what I saw in the prospective but basically I did intrinsic valuations of all three pieces but think of what I allowed me to do it I had full financial statements for all three companies because at the prospectus for Alibaba Yahoo Japan was a standalone company Yahoo gave me parent company numbers I was able to Value three companies because I was given the financials but that's not always the case right if you think about the challenges you face often your value companies with incomplete information I'll tell you a story to kind of illustrate how incomplete in the late 90s I was valuing a Japanese company for one of my valuation books and Japanese companies late 90s were always teaching on the edge of disaster because the risk-free rate in Japanese yeah it was so much slower than the risk-free rate elsewhere in the world you have to be careful about what growth rates used in perpetuity let's care for that finish my valuation I'm patting myself on the back then I look at the financials for this Japanese company and they tell me that they have 227 cross Holdings a stomach drops because if I'm a careful analyst doing intrinsic valuation you know what I should do next right I should value 227 other companies from scratch I'm really too lazy to do them but let's say I'm not as lazy I actually am and that I say okay I'm going to Value 227 other companies I wouldn't have been able to do it for a very simple reason 60 of these companies were public so I could get the financials the remaining 167 were private businesses with zero information provided so I call the investment relations officer of this Japanese company it's a very polite lady and I said look I'm valuing a company it's not for an expose I need some information across Celtics she said I cannot give you that information I said why not she said it's proprietary the way she said proprietary was kind of scary it was a little intimidating but I said okay what if I bought a thousand shares in your company and called you that she said still be proprietary I said that's weird if I own a thousand shares of your company I'm part owner of the company you're refusing to tell me what I owe she thinks for a few seconds that you have a point but it is still proprietor at this point I'm banging my head against a brick wall I get ready to hang up the phone and she says wait I do have some information I can give you about these subsidies I said okay expecting some revenues or operating income I said what and she said I can't give you a details but they're worth a lot I said I'm sitting here with an Excel spreadsheet I'm trying to enter an lot into the cell and I keep getting error messages below how many zeros are there in a lot but it kind of cuts to the heart of the cross-coding culture right what do managers do they hold up a brown paper bag so trust me it's full of cash can I look in the bag no no trust me it's full of cash I'll tell you exactly how much cash and that's exactly what we do with these companies because we let them tell us what their cross Holdings are what we treat that number as the value of the Cross Holdings why would they ever let us look in the bag so the challenge you often face in practice is you don't have the numbers to do an intrinsic valuation or just too many companies I mean let's face even if I had the financial do you really want to Value 227 companies to decide whether to buy one company I don't so I'm going to give you some shortcuts you can use let's stay with the Japanese company I told you 60 of these companies were publicly traded right so what's one way I can cheat to come up with the value for these companies they're publicly traded there's a market price I know it's cheating why because I'm taking up pricing and adding on to intrinsic value but you know what when you're lazy those things kind of slip by see okay I can I can compromise think of how much time it's going to take me to Value 60 companies or the compromise I'll take the compromise on the remaining 167 companies what do you have you have a book value for each of these companies what if I could tell you what the typical price so let's say one of your companies is a chemical company tell me my book value is 10 million and I tell you a typical Chemical Company trades at one and a half times book bag is it the cheating game that you take the 10 million Book value apply 1.5 as a multiple is that my estimated I know it's short but when you have dozens and dozens of cross Holdings rather than value each of them often you take that practice so you want to see a pricing of Yahoo much less done so here's what I did I took the three pieces and rather than try to do an intrinsic valuation of each I priced each one we haven't got to the pricing state but I'll keep it simple I used an EB to sales ratio multiple of revenues and I priced Yahoo the parent company priced Yahoo Japan and priced Alibaba then I brought those numbers together to come up with the pricing you're saying what's this taxes one of the conditions that Alibaba put on Yahoo as part of their IPO is the after their IPO Yahoo had to divest itself I think of eight percent out of the 22 percent it was a requirement the problem is when you divest it when you sell it you have a capital gains tax that's going to come to you that's what I'm trying to estimate the taxes to so often the shortcut of of pricing the subsidiary is something we adopt because we don't have the information we're in a hurry we have too many cross Holdings and if you have a company lots of cross Holdings unless you're one of those companies the cross soldiers 80 of your company's value the shortcut might do a pretty good job of taking care of those cross Holdings so you can move on so that's the cross holding and as I said it's not easy it's a I'll tell you a quiz too this is going to be the problem that always gives people trouble because they don't know what to add what to subtract so start wrestling with the accounting for cross holding because it's something that you will find yourself struggling with because the nature in which the accounting is done so you value cash you Value Cross Holdings and then you look and say there's something I've missed and this is where you make the mistake of looking at the balance you think why is that a mistake because you start seeing this or Goodwill maybe I'll add that on are they on physical assets your real estate so I'm going to State a rule that I hope you never buy you can't double countenance so if you're a hotel company and I do a discounted cash flow evaluation of you as a hotel business where I look at their revenues your you know what you can't do you can't add the value of the real estate that you sit on to your discount cash flow valuation why not because that real estate is what's generating the cash flow so you can't count the cash flows on an asset and the value of the real estate it sits on so if you value JP Morgan with a dividend discount model you can't add the value of 285 park or 277 park or whatever other buildings they have pre-evaluation because those are the buildings that your Traders and your Bankers sit in that generate the cash flows that give you your dividends so what are you looking for you're looking for truly vacant assets what's a vacant asset something with value but it's contributing nothing to The Operators what what kind of asset would that be I'll tell you a story kind of and it'll bring home what I mean by awake at us where the micro price fund Michael price fund is a fund that was was founded by Michael price who you know 20 years ago sold this Mutual part of the Japanese and sold for 250 million dollars get a lot of money and when NYU knows you have a lot of money especially if it's certain they notice you have a lot of money then come and ask you for mine I've never been part of the process I hate asking for money and why would I want to bring money into University where I know how much is going to get wasted but in this case I made an exception and then I said can you go talk to Michael price because they wanted to create a fund that mbas could manage that's a Marketplace so I think in the Original Seed meaning for the fund was 10 million dollars so it's run by a group of mbas it rotates every year obviously because people graduated new people come in I've had zero official role in this fund but almost everybody goes through the fund has gone through one of my valuation classes and the way the fund works is you pitch a stock to the other people who run the fund and they decide whether to buy the stock so guess who they come and try to pitch on first I unfortunately end up being or can I try the pitch on you and I say okay that's it so this is about 15 years ago you know one of the people running the fund comes in and he says I'm facing a conundrum very quickly to turn to my computer type in the word conundrum I thought it was confused but I like the word I said what's your conundrum he said I'm valuing Playboy I said I don't see a conundrum yet he said I've valued it at 240 million it's priced at 300 million I still don't see a conundrum I like the word so much I was going to use it every year you don't buy the company he said here's my Canon there's one asset that Playboy has that's very valuable that I haven't included in my 240 metal what do you think he was talking about so don't think bunnies they're already in the cash flows okay don't take magazine it's already in the cash flows you know what he was talking about the Mansion Playboy Mansion is one of the most valuable properties in LA and it's owned by the company and yo is the problem that at that time he estimated the value of the Mansion to be about 150 million the question he was asking is can I add the 150 million on to the 240 million in which case the company looks under it I said yes but you have a problem there's an 81 year old in a bathrobe hanging out in that mansion that you can't exactly throw it under the street right because you know who was living in the Mansion Hugh Hefner was still there so he said what should I do I said check the Actuarial tables so what am I checking for check to see how long 81 year olds surround themselves with 26 year old Playmates tend to live it's not that long that's it five years right seven years make a judgment it's not going to be 500 years it's not going to be 15 years and then he said what should I do this guy needed guidance all the way through I said take the value of the land discard it back seven years you want to get fancy music caustic capital for real estate companies be my guest but then I added on to the 240 million that's a vacant asset something you haven't counted I forgot all about this but a few years later I wake up to a story in the Wall Street Journal and Playboy managed to have its cake and eat it too here's what it did sold the mansion to a Greek billionaire with Hugh Hefner in it I'm not kidding you the by the guy bought the Mansion on the contingency that Hugh Hefner could live out the remaining years in the mansion so why would he do that reflected Glory or whatever reflection you get out of the Playboy Mansion they actually sold it 200 million dollars that is what a vacant asset looks like it's not physical land that you already have a factory on it's something that has value that you have encountered in your operating assets that you're bringing in and that's not double Counting but I'm going to present you with go back to the hotel example because around the world especially you know five star hotels expense of facing a conundrum let's use that one one last time do it see what that conundrum is here's what they're facing and I want you to think about it let's say that I take the Ritz Carlton or the Waldorf Astoria story names and I value them as something else let's take the word of a story let's have values Hotel what does that mean I project our occupancy rates of the hotel charge of price take the present value let's say I come up with 600 million and then I look at the value of the real estate that that hotel is sitting on and I come up with the value of a billion which one should I use as my estimate of intrinsic value the 600 million of the bill let's say you think about investing in it's a traded company you got 600 million as a hotel company a billion as real estate which one should I use as my intrinsic value estimate the lower of the two the higher the two of us on the average of the two or will it depend on what my role is as an investor first if I take the higher the two numbers say look the real estate is worth the building what's my biggest risk I buy the company and it stays a hotel okay it's worth only 600 million if I leave it at 600 billion they're going to be people outbid me because the real estate is worth more what did the plaza do though Plaza used to be a hotel you know it's at 8 59th Street they converted themselves into an apartment building and because one of the things that does happen at some point in time is Real Estate becomes more valuable you're going to switch away from being on a telecom the other isn't that especially at Peak real estate prices you watch you get what's called a sale and Lease back you sell the real estate you collect the high price and then you lease it back hopefully at some discount rate you continue to run as a hotel around the world this is becoming an issue a lot of companies that sit on very valuable real estate are worth more as real estate than they are as operating companies and it's in Asia and this is out of control because you take real estate in Bangkok in Mumbai and you look at how much it's gone up it's very difficult to justify running a hotel company on that real estate it's just worth too much so we talked about cash cross soldings other assets let's talk about complexity I'm going to present you with two companies you know company a company B again not particularly creative names company a simple Company B is complex and we already talked about why you want to buy the simple company because there's so much in the complex company you don't know that when you get a surprise it's more likely to be negative I'll be quite honest first 15 years I taught valuation I didn't think seriously about it then in the late 90s there was a company called Taiko that had an accounting Scandal and ended up losing almost 80 percent of its value I'll tell you what Taiko was Taiko was a conglomerate that grew through acquisitions and in the process of doing acquisition they had a lot of bad stuff and it all blew up and took the company down but that's not the story as Taiko stock price dropped 80 percent GE lost 15 of its value do you think what's one got to do with the other how do I describe type of conglomerate that grew through Acquisitions and it used the acquisition process to hide a lot of bad stuff what was the in the late 90s a conglomerate that had grown through Acquisitions you can see already as an investor you're saying I got burnt with that go how do I know GE is not doing the same thing it doesn't sound fair but that's how investors adjust I was actually teaching evaluation class which is pretty much every year and unless it's sabbatical interview so during the class somebody said well you know should we be you know we have a company like type or should we be discounting the value this kind of bad stuff probably and then they said there are two questions we need to address if you want to bring complexity value we want to say complex companies are worth less than simpler companies because we worry about this downside risk first we need to measure complexity we can't say I know it when I see it you have to come up with a measure of complex and second we have to figure out how to bring that measure into our cat remember ultimately we have only so a certain number of tools to move out we can adjust the cash flows you can adjust the discount rate you can adjust the length of the growth period they all agree they said well how should we measure complexity they said you're teaching the class why don't you come up with the measure it's your job okay I came back the next class with my first measure of complexity and they weren't impressed this is what I did I counted the number of pages in the 10 q and the 10K I know it's incredibly simplistic but play along with me if you wanted to avoid valuing one company in this group which company are you not going to want to value because it's 1026 Pages this is in War and Peace this is how many pages it took Citigroup to tell me what happened in one year takes you a thousand Pages plus to tell me what happened last year one heck of a screwed up conversation different uh president present this the mbas were not in the Press they said we're not paying 200 000 or 150 000 to count pages in a decade okay we'd like something more sophisticated I said you're right what was I thinking I'll be back next class I came back next class with what I call my valuation list but technical term it's all the things that bug me when I value a company and how much they bug me I made it into a spreadsheet I'll give you examples of things that bug me a company that claims to be geographically Diversified but doesn't tell you where or they break down the revenues by geography but don't recognize any of the geographies it's like you know Lord of the Rings Universe it's not any universe that I'm familiar with I remember the first time I valued BMW break the revenue stand or North America South America Oceanic um turns out to be Australia New Zealand Indonesia but you can see if you bunded them together so these are things that bug me tax rates that move wildly deferred taxes that go from asset to liability so I built this spreadsheet where I said you know what I've come up with a way of you know coming up with the score basically I'll go through and the higher the score the more complex you're as a company so I come back to my class and they said do you like this more and this this is exactly why we come back for mbas this is so much better I said it comes with a consequence to come up with the score for Citigroup what do I need to do read 1 000 pages and I said I don't feel like doing it but each of you is valuing a company this semester for your project right they could see the train coming at them down the tracks too late to get out of the way now I said this semester in addition to value a company for your project why don't you come up with a complexity score it wasn't a question it was an idiot they bitched and they're more I'm going to destroyed they should have just picked the number of pages that I offered them the previous week that semester in additional value companies every person in the class had to come up with a complexity School I'm glad I did it because we learned something about complexity that semester first I went into this process thinking that large companies would be more complex in small companies and what I discovered there was almost no correlation here and small companies were complex and large companies that were not Walmart simple company to understand snowflake incredibly messy company second they found that Emerging Market companies were about 20 to 25 more complex in developed Market companies usually because of cross-solding structures pyramid structures cross Holdings they found that any company that grew through Acquisitions was almost 40 times more complex than a company that grew with internal products some of you are struggling with companies that grow through Acquisitions and you're already seeing some of the issues right when you have Acquisitions your capex is Lumpy you do a big acquisition you don't do one for two years and it creates accounting debris things like Goodwill and writing off of restructuring and and finally they find that any company with a financing arm embedded with incredibly more complex than a company that not I'm talking about right GM GMAC Ford Ford Capital Volkswagen Volkswagen Capital why because you put a bank in the middle of your company and said that we have a Chinese wall around the bank trust us all the debt is in the back how do I know and they also found that a significant amount of complexity was self-imposed I mean manage is always a counting standards a country I'm in it was by Design you're saying why would I make my company more complex what incentives to companies have to make themselves more complex if you can't figure out what's going on in the company you can't even ask any good questions right you're managing the company badly I have no idea you're doing it for control you're doing it for the fact that people can't ask you questions and essentially it protects you that's management so that semester the most complex company in the class that people came up with this G I tell people look if I'm the devil I'm not planning to get to that position but if I did make it and my job was to deal with all the bankers who end up in hell and there'll be quite a few and I had to design a company to torture them I would make a g and here's what you'd have to do you'd have to Value GE or it'll be like you know over and over again you'd have value G for the rest of Eternity the nightmare of a company I'm not even talking about the GF today which is the walking this was at its peak I would look at the company and say no it's a company that you're terrified by any six different businesses you get GE Capital is one of the best growth Acquisitions it is almost like Jack well said how can I make a company that's so incredibly difficult to understand that people will just give up so think about complexity and when you look at your company centers it's messy stuff in the company some of it is by Design it's there to obscure the truth and your job is to get past and make your best passion so once you've measured complexity because what do I do about it so let's cut it cut down to basically what are your choices one is you can haircut the cash flows for complex comments you know what that means you get your expected cash flows and you knock on 10 percent and or therein lies the problem why ten percent why not 15. so you take complex companies I've never tried that because I can't tell why it should be 10 and 20. the second is you can try to use higher discount rates for complex companies you think where would it show up it's not in the risk period the risk premium stuff to do so here's what I did remember this was one of the months I spent during my sabbatical on complexity I took um the S P 500 and I broke it up into two groups of 250 companies one group that I called 250 simpler companies and the other group 250 complex company a little bit of subjective judgment but I mean then I computed the implied cost of equity remember how I did the implied I put a risk through the entire Market I did the implied cost of equity for the complex half and the implied cost of equity for this simple and at least the time at that time when I did it the complex half of the S P 500 the cost of equity but one percent higher than the simple answer if I wanted to extrapolate that but with a complex company I'm going to take risk free rate plus beta times Equity risk premium and add on an extra percentage for the fact it's a complex company but I'll give you my favorite device for dealing with complexity remember the value of growth comes from earning excess returns earning over and above the cost of capital when you have a simple company and you see the company earning a 30 return on Capital let's take amateur great biotech company it's fading it's a scared up who's earning twenty percent return on Capital ten years ago and ask me why is it earning a 20 return on capital above the cost capital I could give you a good reason it's a pharmaceutical company it's got patents these are Big Blockbuster drugs I understand whether it returns in capital comes in contrast if you have a complex company you see them making money but you have no idea where they're making money or how they're making money even if they're making a 20 return on Capital if I ask you can they keep doing what they're doing if you don't know what they're doing how can you make that assumption and going back in time the late 90s one of the companies people have picked for this class to Value was Android that time you know successful company huge market cap and to a person every person who picked Enron to Value show up in my office and say look I see that this company is making a lot of money but I have no idea what they do nobody could tell me what's the traded energy what what does that even mean who do you buy it from who do you sell it from why do you make money on this and did all these special purpose entities you no idea what they did but they threw out these huge profits at that time we didn't know about the underlying accounting scandals but my response was if you don't know how they're making money you can't assume they can keep making it you got to bring the return and capital down to the costly Capital very quickly which will reduce your value as a company and it sounded unfair that I was punishing a successful company but with complex companies Sometimes the best way to deal with the seller if I don't understand the company I really can't tell a story a sustainable story about them being able to continue to do what they're doing and that's going to affect the value of your company so if you have a complex company pick your poison decide what how you're going to bring in that issue of complex because it's cathartic because this company has forced you to suffer for three weeks in the valuation you get a chance to knock off that to make you feel a lot better knock off a few billion dollars in value for making your life difficult for the last three weeks but it's that adjustment for complexity just as a final throw away as the end of the month came about it was finishing up there's a so I wrote this this paper and complexity that became a chapter in my book I got to the last section and I took a hundred largest market cap stocks in the U.S and a random aggression of Price to Book ratios against return Equity paid and growth which are kind of three standard variables and we'll talk about this more that you throw on the explained price tomorrow and then I threw in the number of pages in The 10K into the regression first I wanted to look at this coefficient and give me an intuitive reading of what that does minus .003 times number of pages in my 10K so I have a hundred extra pages in my 10K what's my price above it drops at 0.3 imagine being a consultant at sitting group they say look up prices because only 0.9 we'd like to double you know what they need to do right now call 300 pages of the Thousand page 10K it's easy it sounds facetious but remember Citigroup ended up with a thousand page 10K by Design they did it because City Corp which is a bank but Travelers which was an insurance company and they decided they were going to make the largest Financial Service Company in the world it's going to be all things to all people it's going to be a real estate broker with Caldwell it was going to be an insurance company it was going to be a bank it was going to be a portfolio manager great Ambitions but sometimes in the process you create this mess of a company the people who can say I give up I think money sent events are contaminated by this use since 2008 people just don't trust Money Center Banks because too many different businesses every three years what do you have you have a scanner some Trader in London Wales Swan or whatever you know lost to three billion dollars it's almost built into the system and you build these complex companies so complexity is something you're going to encounter in different levels in different companies and you've got to figure out a mechanism for bringing that you have talk about that I'm going to give you two different rules for that one is when you compute debt for cost to Capital which you have to do right you have to come up with a debt to use for the debt weight of the cost of capital the other is the debt you will use to subtract out from Enterprise Value to get to Value that way on the first one when you ask me what debt should I use for the cost of capital my advice is staying there on your definition of that if you remember I said use all interest bearing debt and at least it should be treated this no matter what the accountant says now that they've come around to my point of view it's you're getting convergence but all interest bearing data releases but stop them fight the urge to start adding other stuff into that the reason you you have to find the edge is you're trying to be concerned and accounting conservative means counting everything in that's not underfunded out no pension obligations undefunded Healthcare obligations the reason I want you to be cautious if you add numbers to your debt make sure debt higher it makes your debt ratio higher but help me out here what's what's it going to do to your cost to Capital became pushing numbers into your debt it'll actually push your costing Capital down that's not conservative so the cost of capital calculation be narrow in your definition to use the cost of capital you come up with the value of the business now you come to a second place where that comes in play which is what do I subtract out from that value to get the value back remember you're the equity investor this is your last chance to deal with anything that works so in addition to the debt that you had new cost of capital if you have underfunded pension obligations do you have to come up with that money at some point in time yeah unless you get government to pick it up so when you get from from the value of the firm today you might use a more expensive definition of debt where you bring in things you did not include as debt new cost to cap the things you worry about as an entertainment and here's something that at least in the U.S is on the radar for pretty much every company which is you're going to get sued it's almost a questionnaire not a question it's not a question of whether it's always a questionable so let's say you're the target of a loss it's a big class action lawsuit right now the lawsuit is too fuzzy there's nothing on your balance sheet that shows that you're exposed but as an equity investor should you worry about losing absolutely so let's say the lawsuit you could lose a billion dollars and there's a 10 chance you could lose the loss first pure probability the expected value of that loss it is minus 100 million you got to subtract it out to get to the value directly that sounds like a strange thing to do but what do you think Tobacco Company investors have been doing for the last 30 years they've been rallying tobacco companies and having to bring in this expectation that some of their value is going to go away because of lawsuits in fact the day that Congress actually decided to to to to create damages for tobacco companies stock prices went up because those damages were created in return for taking the lawsuits off the table pharmaceutical companies the longest I think from 2007 through 2013 Mark's value was way down because of the Box lawsuits so when you have a lawsuit out there you've got a factor in the you say how the heck am I going to come up with a Chance that I will lose the lawsuit get some friends at the law school let's face it this is not nothing to do with the economics I I find this the entire process by which you end up paying your losses to be so convoluted because it's not just one suit where you win or lose right you got an appeals process and appearance of appeals I remember about 15 years ago and I'm in my office three students from the law school show up and said aren't in the wrong building that time you'd need an ID you could come into anybody and I said well they said they said you know we are now finally you're of law school we don't want to be Lookers I said well talk to the deed you got an existential problem what am I going to do they said we want to go into investing yo do you think we I said yeah but you know maybe you should play to your nature and I suggested them that they create a business built entirely around lost there's an investment business here right so here's what you do you advise you'd basically pick companies that have been targeting lawsuits and you focus entirely on the legal aspect forget about cash flows and let other people deal with that you could make a ton of money in those businesses because you're a little better recessive amazing because otherwise markets you just swing around every win a lawsuit your stock price goes up you lose a lawsuit it collapses no and it can be a huge number bear you remember the German in France bought a company called Monsanto about it six seven maybe huge acquisition at that time they had all these strategic reasons for buying it but when they bought monsante they bought themselves a huge legal problem not the legal promise what did Monsanto bring to bear that that for the next five years way better lawsuits to open a product called you know Roundup which is you know pretty much every lawn in the U.S was treated ground up and Roundup was causing cancer so this is a class action lawsuit to end all class because everybody potentially I mean it started with landscapers saying we're getting cancer but basically you know millions of people could kids rolled in the grass no no I think that that pay lasted five years eventually the only way I did it was they paid a preemptive billion dollars a billion and a half to make it go away this is not a small issue it'd be an issue that brings a value and if you're investing in a company when this is a worry you've got to bring it in explicit so when you think about what you should subtract out be expansive in your definition of your lawsuits you might have to bring them into the and if you have things like underfunded pension obligations legal obligation they might not be part of debt when you do cost and capital but you should be incorporating them when you think about what do I now how do I come up with the value if I put in a company any questions on on so basically two rules on that because the capital B be narrow in your definition when you think about what do I subtract out you can bring in issues that you worry about including regulatory costs you face expected legal all the things that you think you have to end up paying as an equity investor which brings us to the final topic for today which is increasingly as I've said you know companies pay their employees without and it's um I'm just I just finished my post on dividends and BuyBacks which is my last data update post for 2023. and if you if you know last year I think Congress is part of the inflation reduction Act created this one percent tax you have to pay as a company if you do BuyBacks because you know Senators don't like BuyBacks I think it's a terrible thing they want to discourage companies from buying back stocks Kerala fish I don't want to open up but there's the Congress often passes laws against something that they think is undesirable Behavior so the early 1990s Congress was worried about the fact that CEOs were making too much money so if you think this is some new phenomenon they notice to hear this has been around a long time so 92 Congress and its wisdom decided to pass a law limiting how much CEOs could be anything this is good and but that law was written in terms of pay and bonuses because that's how managers got paid so the law gets passed with a cap on how much a company can pay and how much they can pay in bonuses but what it completely ignored because they didn't exist was things like management options so guess what happened over the next decade pay went crazy because companies decided by our password options and aided and embedded by accountants telling you that when you give an option which is at the money you're giving away nothing they gave everyone tends to manage auctions law of unintended consequences so if you look at the starting point for employees being paid with Equity it's the fact that you know companies increasingly realize they could get around the law by using options or restricted stocks and that's continued it's actually become a big part of compensation packages so let's take the options part because that came first and let's think about how to deal with options and we'll talk about restricted stock and talk about why companies have moved away increasingly from options into restricted stock you know what restricted stocks right you get shares in the company what's the Restriction that those shares come with when you go get a company you cannot sell them for a period three years five years there's a vesting period first before you get the options and you've got to wait so the Restriction is on liquidity restricted stock up far easier to work with in valuation than options so I'll talk about right options are a bit of a mess so what I'm going to do is actually to set up the process is to think about first what has been done in the past so let's start with restricted stock right because they're easy to deal with I'm accompanying I pay my employees with restricted stock remember we said you do this because you don't have the cash it's a competition expensive what do we do with all of the compensation expense or treat them as part of cost of goods sold we reduce our revenues by it and we come up with lower runs so you get restricted stock it's called lower your earnings and don't give me that crap about it being non-cash I don't care it's bad you skip this step you issued the shares the public taking the cash and paid it the restricted stock are going to reduce your earnings your share count is now going to go up right because you've restricted shares outstanding so an evaluation if you do things right and include the restricted stock as part of your Share account and you have you're use your earnings that are after which right now is how earnings are calculated restricted stock take care of themselves so don't ignore restricted stock they're always in the footnotes but bring them in as part of the channel then what's so different about options to understand what they're you know the issues that come with options let's think of a very simplistic and simple reason why options affect your value options affect your value because you give the right to somebody to buy shares at a fixed price in other words when they exercise it they're going to buy the shares and then discard the marketplace that's really the problem with options is not just that you're giving managers a right to buy shares but right to buy shares at a fixed price and they're going to exercise right when the stock price goes on so with option the question always has been how do you bring in that expectation because even though the options are usually granted at the money it's really about what will happen in the future so I'll take you through three ways in which people deal with options in valuation and as you go through with each I'll talk about what the limitations of each one are and why it might lead you to the wrong place okay so I'm going to set up a simple example because I think that the best way to do this is actually with the simple example so let's assume that you have firm you value The Firm let's say the value of the firm is 2 billion you've got debt of a billion come up with the value equity I issue options at the money options and this is exactly the example that I did 10 million options at the month and I asked a question will it be my shares unaffected and I think we kind of agreed at least I mean I pushed you into this consensus that when these options get granted you're going to feel poor your value per share will go down so I'll give you the three ways in which people include adoptions and you can tell me which one of the three you would prefer the first is what I call the bludgeon approach the bludgeon approaches what you do you take that billion dollars you had it very badly but instead of dividing by the actual number of shares called primary shares outstanding you divide by what's called diluted ships what you do is you take into account the 10 million shares that will come due when the options we act like they're already out there so you keep the value the equity in a billion you divide by a hundred and ten million shares rather than 100 million shares you get a value of nine dollars and nine cents I think you've earned the value recovery for a very simple reason what am I missing half of all letters probably using blood maybe a higher percentage I've taken care of options what am I missing when I use the deleted approach what what these options get exercised what happens managers come in and say I want to exercise my option they get a shepherd and return what do they have to pay they have to pay ten dollars right you're missing that entire 100 million dollars that's going to come in by leaving the numerator at a billion dollars so the diluted a fully diluted approach you're counting all the bad stuff my share count is going to go up but you're not bringing in the fact that there's going to be a hundred million coming to the firm you're going to undervalue the shares so when people say I've used the fully diluted approach to deal with options you really aren't dealing with options you're doing basically adjusting the count and leaving everything else unchanged is there a simple fix to that add 100 million to the new brand that's called the treasury stock approach in the treasury stock approach yes what do you do you take the billion in equity value you add the 100 million you'd get from the exercise proceeds and you divide by a hundred and ten million shares and you get accounting magic which is you're okay not you're unaffected and you can see why right when I add the 100 million to my new brand and adjust the share card by 10 billion I'm acting like you're going to exercise the shares today when the exercise value is no basically zero which you wouldn't do and of course I'm going to overvaluate so the bludgeon approach undervalues the shares the treasury stock approach will overvalue the shares because essentially I'm ignoring that time premium on the option remember we need the option pricing there's a time frame even option I'm actually in the time frame in this area so the bludgeon approach is screwed up because it doesn't count the exercise proceeds the treasury stock approach is screwed up because it doesn't consider the time frame so I'm kind of pushing into the third approach what's Awards so what do I need to do I need to bring the time premium right what the heck am I going to do that what's an option pricing Mark forget about the mechanics what am I doing with an option pricing model I'm basically getting an expected value for the option of cross all stock prices right that sort of black shows binomial no matter what the model is you're saying look I don't know what will happen in the future but I'm going to Value the option the assumption that prices can go to lots of different points the option gives me downside protection I'm not required to buy if the shares go below 10 but if the shares go to 50 20 25. so an option pricing approach brings in the time premium into the value of the option so the third approach is what I do rather than adjusting the share count or just the exercise proceed I first value the firm and value the equity like I don't normally done then I value the options what does that mean take the 10 million options to add the money look at the time you know time to expiration I mean we know if you've seen option pricing models you give me the parameters I can come up with a value of the option and those options are not going to be what zero because it's time left in the option I might come up with three million seven million 15 million I'm going to subtract the value of the options from Equity well let me repeat that again I'm going to take our you know the billion dollars value subtract out the value of the options and then divide by the primary shares on state so rather than adjust the share content I'm adjusting the value of the equity for the value of the options understanding I know it sounds incredibly messy but actually option pricing models are among the easier valuation models because there are very few parameters that are that are in your control right the S the K the T the r the sigma they're all give it no so it might be wrong and it's actually one of the easier valuations but that becomes the key to this process of running the options so when I you know when we when I first brought this up 30 years ago the accounting argument is too complex people wouldn't understand so that's why at that time options were not expensed no the existing options would just added to the share car but it's always been the case that you can value options but I'll give you the caveats option pricing models the black show the binomial were designed to Value listed options on the Chicago Board of options soon you think so what you know the typical life of those options was three months six months so they're designed to Value short-term options and when you exercise an option on you know that you get on the Chicago Board of option the company has nothing to do with it's between you and summer so it doesn't affect the share code employee options are different first a typical employee option is ten five to ten year of insurance so it's not shorter so the Assumption you make about variance not changing which is part of an option pricing model becomes stretched but there's a second problem which is when employee options get exercised you actually affect the share card there is an effect there's a dilution effect the way this plays out is let's say the stock is trading at 10.15 and your exercise price is 10. and you have 10 million options you decide to exercise you know what's going to happen the second you announce you're going to exercise them the 10 and 15 cents is going to become 9.75 because people are going to factor in the dilution factor so we need an option pricing model that can deal with long-term options and also deals with this problem of early exercise that you know there's also a third problem which is traditional option pricing models assume that if you're in the money and your option you can options never get exercised before expiration on the city Builder because you always sell it to somebody else you get a Time premium body exercise The Profit employee options is they're not tradable your work at Apple you've got two million options in apple you think the stock prices that are high you can't sell those options so you know what's going to happen when you have employees who think the stock price is pink you're going to get people exercising on an auction earlier than the maturity they're saying I'm going to cash in Tesla is at 1 200 per share this is about as high it's going to go like there were a lot of option exercises that occurred around thousand dollars per share for Tesla because a lot of employees want to do cash good good for them that they did so here are the three problems the long term they get exercise starting and there's a dilution and that was the argument a lot of people said you can't but that's not a good argument right because you can adapt option pricing models and that's what I'm going to do I'm going to take traditional option pricing models and I'm going to adapt adapt them to do what adapt them to more longer term options which means my variance estimates have to be better adapt them for dilution which means my stock price will be a shifting Target it won't be the actual stock will be stock price adjustment dilution and adjust them for the fact that these options might be exercised well before eventually I won't go into the details because it's almost to the end of the class but we can do it in fact accountants now do it with traditional option threats now they have to be treated as expenses starting in 2007. companies which Grant options to employees have to treat them as expenses in the in the saying you didn't get the so the free lunch you got into that which is if you give options we won't worry about it that's gone so guess why companies have shifted to restricted stock once you took away that freebie reasoning options company said no maybe I shouldn't issue options we'll go with restricted stock they're easier to manage so thank God for that I'm glad that we've shifted aware from options but there's still some companies out there like Cisco that are big Grant is of options so next session when we start we're going to use an option pricing model to Value the options and bring it in but we're also going to talk about what about option brands in the future this takes care of options in the past but what if I expect my company to keep doing this for the next five years the next 10 years how do we bring it so I will see you after the breakup I I would send you an email today I'll send you an email tomorrow I would send you an email on Friday but then you get a week off I promise you you will not hear from me but one week from Friday I will be back I'll be back 
before obviously yeah I went there afterwards hello how are you doing okay thank you not to be out of a job thank you thank you okay uh welcome back at the start of the class I said valuations things always happen what can happen in a week the week we've been gone quite a lot right anybody values if you were then I think this is one of those case where it asks you to change your company now because there's really no points in general some of them foreign Beyond Redemption what was that Cardinal said what was the sin that brought them down they kind of like match their customer deposits with like mortgage-backed Securities what's wrong with that there's like a 10 or mismatch because a customer can come in basically it right I mean what they invested was you consider it pretty safe the mortgage-backed Securities they bought were highly rated they bought a lot of Treasury bonds the problem was they bought 10 20 year Securities with deposits that are either demand deposits or short-term fixed rate deposited duration Investments and my corporate finance class I talk about this is one of those first principles you don't violate because sooner or later it catches up now why did they do it though these are not stupid people I would assume so what I mean remember much of this happened in 20 20 21. so why would they take deposits and invest it in t-box what drew them to these long-term Securities I'm going to stay with you and so what was it that led them to do this um well I think just like they were they were having a tough time sourcing BC projects so they weren't like you know getting sufficient Returns on uh on those but why did they buy short-term keepers um photo short term people writes live in 2000 and 2001. close to zero percent right they did it for a simple reason which is they said these deposits are effectively free we're paying almost nothing on it we can invest it 1.7 we're going to keep the spread this is how violations get on it looks easy and then the whole thing blew up of course in 2022 because long-term rates went to four percent and what I mean we talked about the estimating the market value of a bond remember I said you can convert Book value debt market value debt you take the book value of their treasury Bonds were about 91 billion but that book value is based out of 1.7 rate that they bought those Browns at the rate on these bonds has gone from 1.7 to four percent you revalue those bonds what's going to happen to the value of these bonds go down they're going to go down they drop by about 18 minutes that's at the source of this problem they have an 18 billion dollar home that was not recognized because the accounting term they kept it at Book value until they could not do it anymore it's it goes back to First principles if you violate first principles things will always catch up I mean there's actually a very into this called the cherry tree a lot of hedge funds claim to use what's a character it's somebody who described to me how you make money in a character what do you do usually involves two different currencies you borrow money in a low interest rate currency like the Japanese Yen you invested in a higher interest rate currency like the US dollars right now the 10-year Japanese government baud rate is one percent you borrowed one percent you invested in t-bonds at four percent this seems like easy money right it's one of the stupidest trades you can think of because you're assuming that there's no good reason why the rates are different and that exchange rates won't make up most of the time you get away with it that's why it's so alluring is 95 times out of 100 you make money but you know the dangerous when it grows up it takes out all 100 Years of profits plus more it's catastrophic I call these strategies that is cute strategy with most of the time but when you lose you lose in catastrophic amounts so keep that in mind as you look at people say it's easy money to be made there is no easy money to be made anywhere in markets take that as a gift so when somebody says it's easy money to be made they either haven't looked hard enough or they don't know where to go there's always a catch and you've got to look through what that catches finally putting Silicon Valley catered them what is that a problem startups the startup ecosystem VCS Founders and the most violently connected group you can think of right did it help them well they grew absolutely because they've already fed each other I put my money in Silicon Valley Bank are you going to do it too life is full of trade-offs the same forces that allow them to grow fast turned against them over a period of 48 hours now and this is the irony the trigger to this whole meltdown was Silicon Valley actually trying to do the right thing which is they wanted to take some of their losses 20 in fact sell off 20 billion dollars of the bonds which created three billion dollar loss but they were going to issue three billion dollars of equity to kind of bring themselves to a better capital good thing to do right but they mangled the whole offering because word of the offering leaked out before the actual offering was started and the meditative people found out I mean this is like lending to 50 000 farmers who are too busy doing real things these are 50 000 VC so nothing better to do than check their forms right their entire business is built on checking their phones and connecting to other people of course they talk to each other they all decided to withdraw money over a period of 24 hours and the rest as they say is history it's bad history but it's history the problem is when Silicon Valley Bank fell was like multiple forces came together to bring them down Perfect Storm but one silicon value fell then of course you get the Ripple effects the signature bank now it's First Republic by Wednesday or Thursday First Republic is probably going to be acquired by somebody because once that debt spiral starts what can you do to stop it right you can't talk it off you can't talk investors off the ledge the positives off the legend the question is will it stop it first Republic or will it find the next Target you can already see that each new Target is is essentially lined up already CSF we of course went over the weekend yes do you think that if Silicon Valley Bank marked their long-term assets to Market instead of to the holding period the collapse will happen sooner it might have but it might have been I mean in a sense did it really get the question one of the things that Silicon Valley Bank did but we allowed to classify these security was called the mature which meant that we could show them at Book value of Base value and they didn't have to show the losses that they had and this is actually one of those interesting questions one of those few places where I think it's worth debate on the one hand it might have allowed depositors more transparency about what was happening and maybe you wouldn't have had the Russian deposit but at the other hand Mark to Market can create its own debts part of it right and this is something we discovered in the in the aftermath of 2008 is when hedge funds Mark to Market it actually made the crisis worse so I'm not sure you could have avoided the crisis your original said it's still the original set right it's not going to go away so it might have happened sooner it might have been more gradual maybe they'd have found a cushion maybe that I found a buyer but I think that in this case you can debate but once you've created that original problem there's no easy way around one way or the other you have an elephant in the room okay so today we're going to really talk about connecting stories to numbers and this is going to read very closely to what you will be turning in if you choose to for feedback next week so we're going to talk about the importance of stories evaluation and the point I want to make is even if you never told the story you've done traditional evaluations Excel spreadsheet I've never had to tell a story the reality is implicitly you're always telling a story but a pretty good example let's assume that you're looking at an Excel spreadsheet it's a traditional banking spreadsheet and and your bananas it's projecting a growth rate of 50 compounded annual growth rate 50 for the next 10 years and operating margin of 20 in your 10 which is twice the intensity average a low reinvestment given the growth and of course the government since all you see other numbers you're seeing this high growth rate the margin much higher than the industry average very low reinvestment and a low cost account is this Adam's telling you a story about the company even though they might so let me start the stories and you tell me what do you think the anus is telling you about the company so first is the company's size right now is it a small company it has to be small fifty percent compounded annual growth would block the company otherwise is a total Market stable across it has to be growing because it's the Stable Market you have a 50 growth rate guess what you have to do you have to take market share away from other people you're saying what's wrong with it well the fact that he's assuming that margins will go up while assuming high growth must mean that the market is big enough and growing fast enough what kind of competitive advantages are you assuming with the company stronger weak they'll be really strong and in terms of capital intensity of the business low Capital intensity low Capital intensity and finally is the nature of the product discretionary or non-discretion what gives it away but it's easy as a cost of capital at a really low cost of capital the fact is you see where you Pro when you if you debate numbers in a spreadsheet you've already lost the script she said why is it 50 why not 40 you're conceding the game the questions you need to ask when you look at evaluation are not so much about the numbers but about the underlying assumptions is the market growing or is it stable be Advanced so that's where you get the weakest links when people are using numbers that are not backed up by stories that are justifying the numbers so so let's assume you've told the value you come up with the valuation you've told a story I'm going to ask you some questions about what might cause your story to change so in other words you turn in your evaluation next week you feel pretty good I'd say it looks good what could cause your valuation to change between next week and May 8th which is where the final broke could analytics report about the company change your story sure right most of the time it does it might have small but it could change your story what about macroeconomic factors hey look at what's happening around you can change your story regulatory changes build a business that's regulated a regulatory change could do it earnings reports from other companies in your sector you're in a let's say you ride sharing company you're looking at Uber and Lyft comes out with an earnings reported stair did he like it or not you might have to reassess what you think about your company this is bad news basically your valuation is going to change every moment of every day after you turn it in and it's going to keep changing after May but guess what the market said prices also changing so complaining about the fact that things have changed is neither you're not there it's a given it's a feature evaluation so get ready for some voluntary especially and fun let's talk about life cycle where I gave you the the corporate lifecycle the startup is like a baby the toddlers teenagers and mature companies and declining companies if every evaluation is a mix of stories and numbers I'd like you to tell me what the mix will look like as you go through the lifestyle the first choice is make sure to check you have the same mix of stories and numbers no matter where you are in the life cycle maybe store the numbers are more important for young companies and stories for all the companies or maybe it's a reverse and why why is that it's also everything is in the future right there's nothing there so you have the numbers but it's not that the numbers don't back you up but there's the numbers reflect what they've already done they haven't done much your stories are going to matter a great deal more if you have young growth companies whereas mature companies you can get away being a spreadsheet Ninja right you can take historical data projected out you're writing Pokemon it's not much of a spot many how much do Divergence and story can you get the story I mean the way I describe it here in chapter 33 of a 35 chapter book okay that's not a whole lot you can do to change the characters you have a young company be ready to tell stories so don't be too hard on yourself and say look I could be wrong I'll save you the trouble you're definitely raw and it's okay because everybody else is trying they're all going to make mistakes it's all about the future so today as I said we're going to spend a lot of time in stories and numbers but there's one loose end in our that we still have to tie up in on there's our friend again he told you he promised me he'd be in class so next class I'm going to forward them to it thank you we're talking about stock based compensation remember what you said about stock based compensation it is part of compensation it is an expense it should lower your income and we're talking about the best ways to deal with management options building value the result using motion pricing the pushback you would get of course is that traditional option pricing models were never designed for employee options because employee options are long term the listed options the traditional option pricing marks value are short-term traditional options have been a listed option the option exchange when you when somebody else loses the company is not involved So when you buy a call option in the Chicago Board of options and you exercise it there are no new shares created it's somebody else losing something to win and lose as opposed to employ your options when you exercise and option you can actually change the share count and affect the stock price if there's one final aspect of employee option that makes them tricky to Value option pricing let's say you buy a call option on First Republic right now why because you think the worst result they're going to come out you're going to be wrong but let's say you're right it's a three-month option and over the next two weeks First Republic stock price goes up 50 percent you made the right guess right two weeks from now remember you still have a couple of months left of the option would you exercise the option or is there a better choice what would you do instead you'd said why because you always get the time premium so with listed options you almost never get early exercise you see so most option pricing marks are designed to Value what are called European options unfortunate choice to tell because it's got nothing to do with geography what separates European options from American options you could be accessed you can have exercise only at aspiration so when you do listed options we use the black shorts model we get away with it because the black shorts modern is designed for European options but let's hear an employee become let's say it's Tesla and let's say you've got your options and the market cap is 100 bills remember what the market cap Rose to right 1.2 trill so you got these options the market caps gone to 1.2 trillion you think it's too good to be true can you sell your options with employee options so if you think the market price is too high what are you going to do then you're going to exercise the option employee options are more likely to be exercised early so unlike listed options where 98 of options get held through expiration with employee options you can exercise halfway through 60 of the wage and that was the excuse that accountants gave for a long time for not using option pricing models to Value employee options they're too long term there's dilution and the maturity might be much shorter than the actuality but those are fixable problems so about 15 20 years ago people started taking traditional option pricing marks and adapting them to Value employee options and that's what I'm going to do I'm going to take remember the 10 million options that I gave the CEO to wrap the money I'm going to use an option pricing model but I'm going to adapt an option pricing model reflect the fact that these are not listed options they're employee options here are the adaptations first the stock price is actually ten dollars but instead of using a ten dollar stock price I use a dilution adjusted price where I say the because of these options is a dilution effect and it's actually a pretty pretty mechanical calculation the price I use is 9.58 even though the actual prices take off let me pause right there by using a lower stock price than the actual stock price what am I going to Value the option I'm going to lower the value of the auction Because the actual stock price is that's an illusion Chester second I have a 10-year life on the option if I really avoid about early exercise I could use a five or a six year life even though the stated life is 10 years in other words I can take option pricing models and adapt it for the fact that employee options are different and using that adapted model the value that I get per option is 5.42 these are at the money options but right now valued as options they're worth five dollars that's the time premium on the option so when I gave 10 million options to my CEO what did they effectively give it in terms of competition 10 million times 5.42 dollars per option give me 54.2 million who paid for it you did as Equity here's what I'm going to do I'm going to take the value of equity that I got subtract out the value of the options say that was my Equity you gave away to the CEO which gives me a low value for the equity and I divide what's left by the actual number of shares outstanding the reason I advertise that is don't double count you know what double counting can involve adjusting the share count for what the future so don't bring in the 10 million option that might or might not be exercised I've been dealt with the option for valuing the options I've reduced the value of equity the value per share that I'm going to get is 946. so the stock that was trading at 10 before I made this announcement that I was giving this India 10 million options one second after the announcement the stock price is going to be down to 946 because I've given away effectively 54.2 million dollars this is what accountants are now doing when they have option grants is there valuing the option using an option pricing model a shortcut is an expense of the year you've grabbed and that's the right thing to do but to show you that doing the right thing doesn't always lead to the right practice what did I understood confidence it's talk-based compensation so accountants go to all this trouble of valuing option grants and expenses reducing your earnings and stock based compensation what do whatever is doing that kind of reverses the process they add back the stock you could lead a horse to the water but you can't make a drink you're doing the right thing by expensing options but accountants are reversing all of their hard work and they do the same thing with leases sometimes I wonder why accountants or any of us try to do the right thing stupidity seems to be built deep into the structure and people keep doing the same things they do over and over again so let's be quite clear options are expenses like everything as they reduce your income and this is deals with with options from the past and what else is there to deal with it's a company done granting options not necessarily right the extent that a company might Grant options in the future give restricted stock in the future you have to reduce future income for those future grants and people say isn't that double counting you're reducing the value of the accurate No it's for two separate effects when I reduce the value of effect for existing options I'm bringing in the deadweight cost of what you've done in the past when I reduce your future earnings it's for what I expect you to do in the future and you can see there are companies like Cisco where you're going to affect them in both places because Cisco has granted a lot of options to pass and it continues to Grant options now Amazon used to Grant a lot of options in the past but it doesn't add much in stock based compensation anymore why because it has a cash to pay employees so you can see that you can have one problem for some company the other for other companies and both problems to some companies and this takes care of both props so I want to stop pause and ask about stock based compensation so you can take the form of options or restricted stock restricted stock is relatively straightforward just adjust the share part options are a little messy you've got to Value the options reduce the value backwards and then divide by the actual number of shares outstanding either way you're reducing your Equity value when you grant options to your employees are restricted so so now let's turn to what uh one of the themes I started this class I described valuation as a bridge between stories and numbers and ultimate the confession when I first started teaching this class I taught it like a number cruncher which is that focusing on numbers and focusing equations and focus on Excel spreadsheets what equals modeling I learned pretty early in this process that that was a mistake because when you feed if you're a number cruncher and you feed into numbers you feed your delusions about positioning and being objective so I argue that whatever your weak side is you need to bring it in because a good valuation requires both sides so I had to teach myself story plan and I started the 90s and and I I would be lying if I said it was easy because when I first started trying to break story into valuation every fiber in my body fought it no don't do it this is kind of weakness so I'm going to take you through a five-step process that I use when I value cards and I force myself to go through these five steps because if I don't I'll end up in a spreadsheet grinding through knots because that's where my Natural Instincts are going to take this five-step process you can come up with your own process for bringing in both times but this works for me it might not work the first step when I want to Value company is I describe this as you know when the way I describe it is is assessing the landscape looking at the landscape of companies which is a fancy way of saying to Value company you need to know what your company does you need know what Market it said you need no words competitors if you don't do that you can't value them so assessing the landscape means recognizing what your company does who your customers are what it does well what it does badly somebody use a company to illustrate this process and it's a company that I think I learned a great deal about on about story time it's my first experience with value Uber in June of 2030. I'll set the I'll set the stage it was a military Journal stop that Drew my attention over the story basically said a company called had raised three billion dollars from Venture capitalism price per company at 17. notice the word I use price the company right because we talked about how we seasonal value comes and I was surprised I was surprised because I'd never heard Uber were you living under a underground effectively I was I took the subway everywhere and never took our service I didn't really know what Uber did let me take that back I said it never heard of uber before I read this new story that was not technically true I'd seen the word Uber show up on my credit card statements in the three months leading into June of 2014 when I saw the news story because it turned out that my son was going to college in North Carolina I was using Uber and using my credit card I don't know how that happened but I thought he was taking German language classes you should have kind of given it away but not so I read the story about a 17 million dollar pricing and I decide I want to value and I know nothing about the company so that's who I call First I call my son but he was still sleeping it's 11 30 in the morning but he kept what I call College student Towers which basically means got nothing to do with the sun coming up and the sun going down it's got It's a different clock all together it's like a year in a different time zone and he would pick up his phone so I decided to call my niece who is technically awake because she had a job so she had to be awake but she was in a horrible mood she picks up the phone so what do you want this is how she reads her favorite and I say did you go to this corporate he said the right sharing company I said what the heck is the right sharing company she said I don't have the time to tell you what it is but you download the app and find out for yourself hangs up her father about this Behavior but no I had to wait so I download the app sitting upstairs in my office I hit the app magical things start to happen on my phone and GPS opens up and I see a car trying to get to me why in New York City you don't get from point A to point B you just try if they get you sagged and you know all kinds of streets are blocked off it's in the car thinking and he's acting and I can see the the name George the car the dragon but never seen this with the Yellow Cab I'm fascinated so 15 minutes later George and his car pull up in front of the 44 Westport Street there and I said hi George this is where do you want to go you can enter a destination is it nowhere in particular but could you drive me around for about 30 minutes I have some questions to ask he thought it was a serial killer but then he said you're too small you can't hurt me get in the back you know Jeffrey dog so when I started asking questions I said this is an Uber car you're driving he said no this is my car I said I remember employee employee Mr why do you do this he said I got a job but I don't make enough money I already own this car this allows me to earn a second income to supplement basis he said New York City it's illegal to stop on the streets and offer somebody right that's technically that's actually true there's Gypsy cat rules that were written 100 years ago he said Uber connects me with customs I said that's interesting so 30 minutes later drops me off I offer to pay him he says no you don't have to pay me I said it's free he said no it's not free but you downloaded the app they ask you for a credit card I said yes and then charge so how do you get it paid did they send me 80 of the fair I said why 80 I said I don't know that's what the order he drives off at this stage I can see why this guy used to because it allowed him to connect to customers on a second income I could see why Uber did what they did they got to keep twenty percent of the fair from being an entity area which left me with one final leg why did my son and my niece like uber so much so I decided to call my son again this diamond is civilized Tower like 3 30 in the afternoon no more excuses to still sleeping here he's awake and I decided to put him on the defensive right away I acted like I knew what Uber was right from the beginning even though I didn't say I noticed you're using a right sharing app and using my credit card to back it up why would you be why do you need ride sharing we have a car with you he actually owned the car he said that on Friday nights and Saturday nights I really like uber as a parent there's some follow-up questions you don't ask but I kind of got it but this is a kid who could not well it's not even in this frame of reference to Haley Yellow Cab I can't even see him on the streets said what do you like about anybody said I can call R from the bar I said that's a plus I said but you must wait forever right he said let's come sooner than I can it's really it's cost a lot right so they're cheaper than it can the cars must be filthy right the cleaner that I have I said let me get this straight they come sooner than a cab they're cheaper than a cab they're cleaner than a cab that's what our new cab service was destined for Doom which left me with one final question what's so special about Uber they're an intermediate why couldn't I get a powerful computer to put in my basement and connect customers to Cops I could think of two things that Uber had that I did not one was three billion dollars they had it I did not a little bit of a disadvantage the second is this is a business with networking benefits people use this as a buzzword but what's the essence of a business with networks no well you could say that about any business so but usually as companies get larger it gets more difficult to keep because the easiest customers get first as you get larger it gets more difficult to add Customs right but if you're in a business networking benefits so and this is actually in Silicon Valley you see this in this this circle that they draw here's how it works as you get bigger it actually gets easier to get bigger here's why if you're a driver and you want to drive for a ride sharing company and I give you two children you can go with this leading ride sharing company the startup rate sharing company which one are you going to drive for you're going to go where the Customs are which is and if you are a customer downloading an app for a ride sharing company guess which one you're going to go to you're going to go with the big so the larger you get the easier it gets to grow the networking benefits and they were first in the game so they had the network that was my research on it he said why do you look at the financial what financials when I when I first learned about Uber they were a private company remarkably opaque private company where there are very few numbers available in the company all I knew about was that gross Billings in the most recent year and how much money they lost that's it but let's assume I'd had all of their financials what would I have learned that are going to be some special inside you know what I have seen small revenues big losses we're still building up there's very little for those of you value on companies and you're spending all of your time reading the last 10K and you report just there's not much you're going to be learned by pouring over those numbers that there's not much there that was my start to the process is setting the landscape this is what the companies this is what it does and this is the business it's in it's the car service business it's not a new business being around it just changed the way the business second stop of the process I need so when I when I got done with learning what I did about Uber by talking to my son my niece and Uber drivers are out in the world I drew a picture I tried to do this and you saw this my attempted Silicon Valley I find that drawing a picture gives me a little more clarity on connections between the different things that are happening this is the picture I do for Uber and basically there's no rocket science here I'm talking about how Uber makes money why drivers like it why customers like it what sets Uber apart from the competition second stop in the process I am going to try to tell a story by the way and let me remind you this is a business story a time you're not a creative novice don't create characters who wander on and wander off for no reason at all keep it simple I'll tell you what you what I don't want to see as your story I don't want to see Game of Thrones you don't have eight seasons and 80 episodes to tell your story you have 15 minutes you want to keep it simple and you want to keep it focused no matter what kind of business you have what's your end game what do you have to convince me as an investing thought about it or at least a pathway to making money doesn't have to be strong it doesn't at least have you thought about the possibility of making money is it asking for too much be amazed at how many startup Founders have talked usually there's some kind of a techie who talks about how to beat their app is it how many people have downloaded in about 20 minutes in the pitch you put up your hand said have you thought about how you plan to make money the pressure okay let me talk about how deep the app is how many people download it at least tell me you thought about you know whether you want to do ads or subscriptions at least so right now I know you're losing money you're still a startup but at least I need to get a sense of here's the pathway that I can see to make it keep it for us and fine stay grounded in reality so when you tell a story I'm going to make sure that you're not telling me a fairy tale because as a Founder you have this incentive to make your story big and Grand and amazing and it's my job to be the Kevin O'Leary of the of this universe and bring you back no I'm not going to talk about licensing deals but you know what I thought but basically talk about hey this is what the world looks like and this is you know the story you're telling tell me that your story is based in reality so you're ready for my Uber story based on what I learned this is a story I told to move there in June of 2014. you see why is the timing so critical I value Uber pretty much every year since June of 2014. do you think my story has changed why has it changed because the world has changed I'll talk about some of the things that triggered my change in Uber stories so I make no apologies in hindsight for saying oh you know what that story was bad at the time that I told the story this is what I thought about it so in my story I described Uber as an urban car service company every word here is going to have consequences what does the urban mean I see Uber succeeding in cities and big towns as a car service business which will bring in new users into that business people like my son and my niece might never have taken a Yellow Cab are more likely to take so it's going to bring in the users with local networking benefits I already talked about networking benefits Uber becomes the largest right sharing company in New York there's going to be a Tipping Point where it becomes a dominant right sharing it's like what's the local government in my story Uber can end up dominating New York lift can take Chicago DD can take Beijing owner can take Mumbai and grab can take quality report so in my store you can have eight or nine different ride sharing companies in different parts of the world and that's going to have consequence in terms of what kind of market share I can give you can have Global networking benefits right Facebook and Google are Global networking better there you get a market share of the total Market my store is local networks and I did assume in 2014 that Uber could keep doing what they were doing which is keep twenty percent of the revenues completely arbitrary right I don't think Travis collecting came up with 20 percent Travis collecting the founder of uber I'm sure he was at dinner one night with a bunch of captains and he's trying to raise money from the check game and knowing Travis he got the BC to pick up the investor to pick up the check they must have wrote a 20 bill said you know what that sounds good let's pick 20 there's no good reason but once you've completed six and I'm assuming it's going to stay at 20 and I would assume that they want to keep doing what they do which is not all the cars and not hire the drivers that was my junior 2014 story you're going to see it play out in the notes now before I convert the story into numbers there's a stop I've got to make I've got to make sure the story I'm telling you is grounded in reality I what I call the three pills first is it possible second test is it plausible third test is it profit sounds like I'm playing on Words Right possible plausible problems we lay the groundwork lots of things are possible a subset are possible and even smaller subset of problems possibly I mean somebody is not something like this somewhere before plausible means you've got to offer me something more some more ammunition to build and probably means you can show me some numbers the city that it's worked in a pilot Market that you've gone on I've wrestled with uh with ways of drawing a contrast between these three words and I'll give you what's worked for me best because I think late in 2017 I was in Latin America I was doing a three City Tour Sao Paulo Brazil on day one Santiago Chile day two and Lima Peru on day three and I was talking about narrative a number of stories so first day I'm in front of 300 Brazilians in a room when I'm trying to I want to pick and talk where every person in the room is going to have an opinion so if I were to pick a topic 300 Brazilians in a room what's a fun topic where every person in the room is gonna happen it's gonna be soccer for six months before the world cup size is it possible that Brazil will win the world you asked 300 Brazilians six months before a World Cup is it possible that president of the World Cup what do you think the answers of course we wanted five times before I said is it plausible that Brazil will the World Cup now if I'd asked this question in December of 2014 that room would have been a little shaky that required this requires a little bit of World Cup history but there was a work up in 2014 it happened to be in Brazil did anybody remember what happened in that World Cup if you're Brazilian you're trying to raise it from your memory but there was this famous semi-final against Germany where there was like seven one eight it's still lacking for the ages luckily by 2017 they had completely wiped this out of their heads they said you know it's possible we have a pretty good team around number two in the world and I said is it probable that presume in the world cup and now you could see the wheels go into multiple in the right group and they are stays healthy and he doesn't flip and flop and do whatever he does in the picture no you could see with each one you're up in the end and I want you to do the same thing with your story is it possible make sure you're not telling your food is it plausible what's the problem so let me take you through impossible stories implausible stories and improbable stories to make sure you're not falling into one of those let's start with impossible stories you know what a fairness opinion is when you do an acquisition in the U.S you have to hire an investment banker to attest to the fact that the price you're paying experience it's one of the most useless Kabuki dances of all time because I've never heard of a deal not go through because you couldn't find a banker to sign off so some of the most horrific mistakes and valuation happen in fairness opinions because people are trying to justify the unjustified this is about seven years ago when Tesla bought Solar City one of the most hopelessly conflicted deals of all time did you see why it was hopelessly conflicted you know who the largest shareholders right a guy called Elon Musk he was buying you know Tesla's buying Solar City you know the largest shareholder in southern city was a guy called Elon Musk what a coincidence so the CEO of Tesla was a guy called Elon Musk the CEO of SolarCity was a guy called Moscow the different first names because his nephew his cousin whatever it is so if they Tesla news is going to get sued and wanted to get you know immunity against loss so where you get it is you hire a couple of Bankers you pay the millions of dollars and you get this legal opinion saying this deal is fair it's an exchange offer so both companies so let's go on and start this is a Solar City highest Lazar which is you know this historic Investment Banking around New York forever and Tesla hires ever core I want to say something incredibly harsh things about evercore but I mean every word so they hire them before they pay them eight million dollars to do this valuation and when you do a fairness opinion the book becomes part of the public domains it gets filed as of course I go through the filings and I'm willing to cut all kinds of slack because I know Bankers have to bend all the rules so I look at solar evaluation of Tesla done by by everyone because remember the next age offer you've got a valuable account so they come up with all these these projected numbers and they get to your your 10 and they project a six percent growth rate forever now first reaction what currency you value in Tesla yeah turned out to be in U.S dollars you know what happens in if you value companies US Dollars uses six percent growth rate for apple and the risk-free rate is two or three percent this is an impossible valuation and for this piece of crap you get paid eight million dollars there's no justice in this world this is an impossible valuation here's another example a company that grows and grows so much that it becomes bigger than the total Market my favorite example for this is about 10 years ago somebody picked Netflix to value in this class I think it's always a fascinating company so the middle of the semester I asked people to turn in their evaluation for feedback he turns in his valuation he's projecting 600 billion dollars in revenues for Netflix I said can you come in and talk and he did so I said do you have Netflix said yes he said about a hundred dollars I said I'm seeing revenues of 600 billion dollars how many subscribers would you need to have to get to 600 he said about you know I don't know I have to get a calculator I said you don't need a damn cabinet it's 600 million divided by 106 billion subscribers he said I don't see where this questioning is going I said have some patience I have a few more follow-up questions I said what is the population of the world I don't know 8 billion is there something I don't know maybe there's a law that's been passed that every man woman child and pet has to have its own Netflix account you're not allowed to share he said don't be upset I think you are this is an impossible valuation this is what happened we let growth rates run amok and you let it project that so take a look at your revenues in your tent not in year one not in year three you're in ten make sure you're not projecting out revenues and exceed the total Market you're going on I've seen valuations where people cut costs right efficiency called they do one year two then you get your 10 they keep cutting costs you got a problem a math problem which is you cut costs your margins improve your margins go up finally there's a hundred percent once you get to 100 there's no way to go you cut costs to zero there's no more efficiency code impossible values so impossible valuations basically there's nothing to debate so don't even ask me whether your beta looks okay you've not be a fairy tale you can do whatever you want to debate it use a negative eight and a risk-free rate that you made up because in a Fairy Tail anything can happen so impossible valuations check what are implausible valuation this is when you tell a story that a plus side looks like it cannot go through but maybe you have a really good explanation I'll give you an example the company that grows without reinvesting no normally it's just that can't happen but if you're an infrastructure company you've spent the last 20 years building code roads you can get rolls for the next 10 years without reinvestment because you're living off after investors I'm looking for an explanation for what it doesn't make sense or a company's margins are much higher than the competition and ask you well what's keeping its margins up it's I don't know then you have a problem but if you tell me look it's because the government keeps the competitors up I mean I remember building a company called automatic Saudi Dairy and agriculture product companies markets through twice as high as the typical food processing company in the Middle East and I was in Dubai and I said how do you keep their mind so hard when somebody in the audience because Saudi Island said have you taken a look at who the largest shareholders the car you know I said I haven't I should and I did turned out to the largest shareholders somebody somebody bins out partisan Saudi royal family there's a competitive advantage member of the royal family acting as protection against competition allows for higher margins see what happens with an implausible evaluation where I'm looking for is a story you can tell me that explains away what doesn't look reasonable so impossible valuations you can't do and much but implausible maybe you have a very special company and finally with improbable I'm going to introduce what I find very useful when I do valuation I'm going to give away what I'm going to do when you send me your Excel spreadsheets process I don't know it most of your company so you're going to be picking companies so I'm not going to be sitting there saying you're 23 Revenue growth should be 25 I don't know what you think I know I don't know your the remedy growth rate for every company in the face so when you put in a high Revenue growth rate for your company I'm going to conceive the space to you and say you know more about this company and if you think it can grow at 25 a year okay then I'm going to check your reinvestment remember that's that that's the uh the line item between your after tax operating income and your free cash flow to the firm and if you have high Revenue growth what should I expect to see in your reinvestment higher reinvestment or lower investment right expect to see hiring on this and I want to check your cost of capital remember I said the median costed capital for global company is about nine to nine and a half percent usually when you have high growth and high reinvestment you're probably also going to have high risk okay that's consistent I'm not saying it's correct but it's consistent low low low consistent but if you have high growth with low reinvestment and a low cost Capital I'm gonna look for a reason and that's what I'm looking at your store can you explain to me how a company can a high roll then maybe your explanation can be their pipe their build up capacity their excess capacity that's why the reinvestment is low and they're providing a product that everybody needs and that's why I'm keeping the cost of capital so when you look at your valuation you can do your assessment yourself you don't really need me to do it so I'll do it for you know anyway but check your growth rate your reinvestment and risk and if they're not in sync ask yourself what is the story that I can use to explain so let me go back to my Uber store my original story was it's an urban car service company that brings in new users into the business and has local networking package it was a very easy story to defend Why by 2014 Uber already succeeded in parts of the world Bay Area for instance that very clear example on the ground that they were able to get car service business away from traditional taxi cabs they're drawing and users every part of the story I have an easy time to send I could have told the biggest story for Uber in June of 2014 yes but the bigger your story The more you have to defend because you now have to come in and say this is why I think the company can do what it is and that's a trade-off you have to think of as a farm you can go for the biggest story you can but you have more lines of Defense to play or you can go for a story that's more defensive my story was a defensible story I'm not saying it's a right Story the wrong story but it's clearly possible plausible and proud thank you once in a while if you're a special investor you will hear a story from a Founder that you so want to be true that you're willing to suspend all questioning I call these runaway stories and I tell you the pieces that go to Runaway store first the Storyteller is charismatic and likable you want the storytelling point second he or she is telling a story about disrupting a business you've never liked you've always hated the best they're going to disrupt their business and to add some icing on the cake they're going to make the world a better place while doing this kind of story let me tell you a story you tell me whether you want this story to be true it's about a 19 year old who drops out of Stanford what's the acceptance rate unless you're a synchronized gymnast or something and you got it through this side or it's like minus three percent you get into Stanford you drop out to start a new business he's saying another geek starting another software business here's where the story gets interesting this 19 year old is not a man but a woman dropping out to start a blood testing she's going to just I think any of you guys like Quest Labs or whatever lab you go to I hate a blood testing business yeah here's how it works you have to get a blood test you got to call ahead they say well you've got an opening in 16 years something closer but there's something in three months if we come at six a.m you take it because what choice do you have you show up at six a.m they make you wait what they can two hours later the doors are open nurse like nurse ratchet from One Flew Over the conclusion has come up come on and you go in they got two buckets next door what is that for your blood why do you eat that much blood just in case Dracula shows up I guess they extract two buckets of your blood you you crawl back to the car you're a baby at this moment then you wait then you wait then you wait and three weeks later you call and say where are my results well they've been sent to your doctor you have to make it so you make an appointment with the doctor 6 AM you shop at the doctor you wait two hours you go in and the doctor after spending 20 minutes says you're okay but then comes the final indignity which is two weeks later you get a bill in the mail that this whole thing cost you two thousand dollars we hate this business right and this 19 year old is going to disrupt that business she's going to create a business where she's going to take two drops of your blood not two buckets but two drops in nanotanus this already sounds incredibly fancy and 45 minutes later she's gonna email the results almost like she's in the 21st century and the whole thing will cost you only fifty dollars and by the way she's going to give away these blood tests for free parts of the world where people can't afford it you want the story to be true did I make up the story well this of course is the true story of Elizabeth Morris drops out of Stanford at 19 starts a company called theranos that does exactly what I described and did people want the story to succeed take a look by the time you got to the middle of 2015 theranos was priced at nine percentage take out the value venture capital is Pirates of the biggest names in the BC business where investors it wasn't just VCS were getting excited the Cleveland Clinic one of the Premier Healthcare faculties in the US that said this looks promising this looks right Walgreens said they were going to have a terrible slab in every Walgreens I look like the entire establishment had bought it if in the middle of 2015 you'd asked me what I thought about there was my reactions I don't know much about the companies privately owned but given the fact that everybody seems not just VCS it's all Marines and people in clinic it's out of here but if you're investing in a blood testing company remember this is not a social media company or an online accessing company it has an investor what's big question you've got answered before you put money in does the blood test work right you think somebody would ask I should somebody would have and I was wrong because in October of 2015 a Wall Street Journal reporter decided to ask this question that's the blood test well and the answer was actually the public domain because when you're a blood testing company you run these tests you've got to go through the FDA so you went to the FDA and said has Tara knows been approved for these 32 tests that came on their web page they can do with the nanotators and the FDA said no they've been approved for 1 to 32 he said how come sir well the tests are kind of low okay what's a noisy blood test trust me you do not want a noisy blood test because here's what the results look like you might be dying or you might not don't worry about it go home we'll tell you in a few months right you want precise blood tests so you wrote about this in the world's return and say this is a company that claims to do 32 tests but it's been approved for only one the company threatened to sue the journal you've probably seen that have you seen the mini series on you know so and then of course in the next six months a whole company it turns out that they've been cooking the books and not that nanotanists did not work the 9 billion very quickly went to zero Elizabeth Holmes was banned from the blood testing business she moved to San Diego a few blocks away from where I live so I see her once you know I used to see her once in a while eventually of course got convicted of her crime she's not going to go to prison so this doesn't end well but if you think about the ingredients here you can see why it happened in October 2015 I actually wrote about and the question I was asking was everybody in hindsight said kind of seen him coming they said really I mean June 2015 Elizabeth Holmes has one of the most celebrated business women on the face of the second they brought their daughters because they wanted to see that it didn't have to be a social influencer to actually be a successful but it was which was I think the most the first business woman under the age they said would you have had the courage to go to that means you're surrounded by 999 other people who celebrate the courage to put up your hand say does your blood test work you'd have felt like the guy who shot bad B's mother said back into that guy you ever thought about this guy maybe you've never seen bad thing with no idea what I'm talking about but the movie started Barry's mother being shot in the woods that must have gone through psychology and psychiatrists were strong my my point is when you when you face these stories that build up that momentum it's very difficult to be the person who raised in the tough questions often you get the self-selection back when people feed it Adam Newman's company and of course master and so on leading back but basically the with these companies unraveling begins because something what is wrong so these runaway stories what usually happens that causes stories to break apart at some point in time you start to lose trust in the Storyteller and then once you lose trust in the Storyteller then you recognize a story they've been telling us at war with numbers you say why did it take so long because as long as nobody's asking questions as long as you're in above the price gets pushed down and we work if we get a chance go back and read my post on rework where essentially at the time didn't went to public and then period of eight weeks the company's pricing went from 19 billion to Brazil Ian how quickly these stories can undraft but that's really what you you're checking against is to make sure that you're not one of those runaway stories staying on the theme of impossible implausible and improbable there is also variation on implausible stories that it might not be at the company level but it might be at the market next player let's assume you're looking at a big Market AI the cloud business what happens when you have a big Market your people that think they can make money so let's say you are you know you come up with the product or service for this Market and you think you can conquer the market what do you need to do you need to go find investors who might buy into your stories to find PCS now if you think about the pieces that go to the puzzle let's suppose you one of those entrepreneurs and you think you can go out to the market I'm going to ask you the generic characteristics of entrepreneurs and you can you can choose not to answer the question but entrepreneurs tend to be shy definite people or a whole confident you can conquer this big one how does this show when you project out revenues in market share you project that high Revolution High market share because you're convinced that you're going to be the one and while you're doing this there are a hundred other clusters in Silicon Valley all doing exactly the same thing probably in offices up and down the same building there are seven people thinking let's see what the end result of this is going to be each cluster thinks it's being brashed but if you add up all of these clusters you get it's almost guarantee that the collective marketing communication is going to be far bigger than the actual Market it happened in the.com room it happened with so with online advertising it's happening right now with AI and Cloud business and guess what will continue to happen as long as we have markets and we're going after what we feel to pick up I call this the big Market dilution which is there's a big Market therefore companies should be worth a lot do you think this with the electric car business decided at least into a couple of years ago we should go for a shot review got pushed up Tesla got pushed up why because it's a big Market out there with China as a market 10 years ago every company going to China so it's pricing pushed up because it's a big marketer it's a variation on the implausible story but it's a variation that shows up only when you get everybody into the room and you recognize that each person is making the projection that collectedly time holder doesn't mean that all of these companies are losing but it does mean that collectively these companies are going to be overpriced because people tend to be overconfident over country people start these businesses and try these businesses in fact what you see here is uh the online advertising business this was in 2015 what I did was I took the market cap of every company that made money on online advertising and I did reverse engineer from the market cap what the revenue should have to be in your debt you could do this with your own spreadsheet you could solve for what the revenues in here then have to be to give you the market price today I did this with every company and I added up all the numbers and the number that I got across all of the companies the projected revenues you think so what the collective advertising Market in 2015. it was about 450 to 520. I was actually projecting the collective revenues in the companies that I was looking at to be great it's an impossible individual each valuation but you can see in collection so the next big Market you know you can see already in the seats the cloud business was there a few years ago it's starting to pay now it's the AI business you know what the next big business will be you can see this phenomenon player this is the benefit because it's the definition of a bubble right agreeing above it because you see a big market and the bubble but then you get reality I actually wrote a piece that actually got me a bit of pushback but what's so wrong because what's your order would you want to live in a world run by actuaries we'd still be in case it's in this fire thing too dangerous let's think about it for a few more thousand years maybe one of these days we'll get out of here every human advances come from human beings overreach that's what above the list people overreach the.com bubble bust right but it changed the way we live our lives when was the last time you actually went into a travel agency you don't think you guys don't even know the travel agencies right there was a time when he wanted to book a flight you actually had to go away to this office and talk to this person behind the desk where it was a magical access to what the flights would look like and they would get you the right flight and you pay them a few hundred dollars for this privilege okay let's face it the.com movement bus changed the way we live online advertising change the way we live artificial intelligence and change the way we live but that doesn't necessarily mean that every company modern space is going to make money we need to stop mistaking big markets for big valuation for every company in that market but the Kathy Wood problem keeps recording right but because that's basically the core of what why Kathy Woods stories don't tell is based entirely on the big market system there's a big Market there for the company has to be worth about that's not enough one final example of kind of delusion they can draw evaluation remember evaluation triangle I talked about and one of the companies that you know we are we saw my Tesla valuation in 2020 2023 but Tesla is a company value right from the beginning this was a 2013 valuation test I came up with what I thought was a pretty upbeat valuation at that time but Tesla at that time was also one of the most widely covered stocks in World stream so after I finish my evaluation from the value 150 per share the IP and equity research report from this well-known equity research damage tracking Tesla and he's come up with a 600 Commission yeah the academic research important like 200 pages long but I finally find this one exhibit with the cash flows and revenues because I want to see what this address is projecting for the company is giving him a value four times higher so first thing I check is revenues maybe history revenue is much greater and these recipes are actually a little lower than this is strange maybe it's margins are much higher to check this margins and he had done a bit down enough the product is revenues are roughly less than what I've projected margins are about the same so why is this value so much higher so take a look at what is reinvesting and the way the easiest way to do this is see what he calls is an unleavened free cash flow that's really free cash flow no it's just a different word for pre-cast as well and there's this netting conversation like an after tax operating it I looked at the difference between those two now so all these different hit line items are as reinvestment for the next 15 years the difference between those two numbers is what is real best and I had a problem because over the next 15 years and he was reinvesting almost nothing now take a look at the Top Line that's the number of cars he expects Tesla to sell it's going to go from 24 000 to 1.100 but let me pause right there is it it's a big Market it's 85 million cars 1.1 is it plausible it's probably I can pass all those tests but here's the problem in 2013 Tesla had one plant in Fremont that was their only plan but the capacity on a good age of 20 000 . we have a problem so I call the equity research he was actually in an airport on his way to California I think was going to worship at a Tesla Shrine somewhere there and I said look you know I've been looking at your equity research report there are some questions about your D dot C that's what he called this is d dot C I decided he said I can't answer those questions I said why not he said well I don't do the numbers I have a team you have said you have an entire team that turned out a scheme of six I said can I call the key he said yeah next week we'll all be together you can close like following week later the entire team has got the ground so lean Adams comes on and he says look I don't do it even though I said what do you do he said today so I take him through any very quickly Frank case he very quickly sees the problem and he said you know what happened he said it slipped my mind I said what slipped your mind and said putting in the reading button I just took last year's capex and depreciation and just projected it out in other words he was doing what training the street teaches you to do right spreadsheet project numbers out and in the previous your capex had be very close to depreciation you projected the number and as and I said do you see what the problems you have a capacity of 200 000 cars you're projecting sales of 1.1 million he said what should we do we can't tell the word we slipped our minds I gave him a suggestion that he did not take my grandson is very fond of this movie called Willy Wonka the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory have you seen this one of my favorite movies I said have you ever seen this movie The irons the 23 year old hadn't seen him but the old round has had and I said well one of the things that always causes me about the movie there's one fact very inefficiently laid out effect like chocolate Rivers Running towards and stuff which turns out the sockets that are sold all over the world and when I came out of that movie when I was younger and I saw my thing was was how does this one Factory have the capacity to reduce all these challenges and the answer is actually in the book that it is mythical creatures you get a chance go on Google and Google and they they dance and they sing and I say dance and sing chocolates come flying out of the pack I said that's what you need to do what are the press release that Tesla has replaced their entire Workforce you know then you can have to catch 200 000 capacity to become 1.2 million he didn't take my advice but I call these Oompa Loompa valuations or we prefer Wheeling bronchitis basically whatever you want to call it you'd be surprised how many valuations you see where people project our growth but they don't reinvest it Generations there's not free lunches you've got to set aside the money if you want the appropriate otherwise something is going to break so is it possible is it plausible is it profitable then we return to my Tesla story I'm now going to take my story and convert nuts what did I describe Teslas and urban car service company right so what's the market it's going to go after the urban car servicemen how big is it nobody knew to that I looked everywhere and finally the reason nobody knew was this entire Market was splinted it was right by the taxi cabs in different cities because I had to come up with the market size I had to go City by City taxi and limousine commissions of their equivalents and New York City this attack commission they have an estimate of what the taxing caps made in 2013 and it did this for about 50 cities I came up with the total Market of about 50 billion for those cities and then I doubled it why because the remaining cities are tough nobody had any I put out an estimate for the total Market of 100. would I be wrong but to show you why Google search can get you in trouble a year later I was looking for size of the urban car service I'm hoping that a better estimate shop guess what shows up as the number one fine 100 period projected by the motor so now it's become this total Market size that if they only knew how I did this and how many pieces I had to guess they wouldn't be so sure about the number except they don't trust Market size on that you might find on Google search because it's somebody's guess and you might have to say yes triangulate make sure but that became the entire that market had been growing at about two percent a year and it will grow at six percent year what is it allowed for it basically allows for the fact that new customers are going to be able to enter so I'm taking each part of my story and making them I gave Uber a 10 market share but I kept it in ten percent was a huge market share for a business where to be incredibly Splendid right what's the largest taxi cab company in the world have 0.1 market share I'm giving Uber 10 but I stopped at 10. why because in my story there are local networks and they're going to be a dozen different ride sharing companies controlling different parts of them I did give Uber an operating margin of 40 why it's an intermediary business in steady state once they stop giving you promotions fish got pretty high launches because they don't own the cars and they don't essentially have any Capital intensity added another city for Ubers almost possible the way this showed up is I gave them the sales recovery show that was twice as high as a typical company in the market because they don't need to reinvest much essentially I'm taking each part of my story made it for now to do a discarded cash flow valuation I do need a discount rate you know how much time I spend on the discount rate over probably three minutes this is not what's going to make will break my valuation I'll tell you what I used at my discount rate rather than go through a beta cost of data cost of equity in Costa Capital which is what we talked about for how many sessions I went to a histogram of course Captain histogram basically I broke down every global card and I love Instagram for this year you can see what the median is what the 10 dollars what the nine I went to the 90th percentile and I said it's a risky company rather than finessing the cost Capital risky company and in 2014 that cost a capitalist purpose and that was the 90th and is there a chance who will not make it remember it's still a money losing small company with a potential regulatory road that so I didn't offer a 10 chance of failing every number in my story is now every part of my story is now a number revenue of all the margins reinvestments so this was my actual my final evaluation it looks like in itself spreadsheet but if you pointed to it now where you're gonna ask me why is your number what it is I'm going to respond to this story why are my Revenue it's 3.6 millimeter debt because the Uber is an urban car service companies local network and better that should be the way you think about responding to questions about it it puts an evaluation is a story that justified that now the ad valuation that I got from Uber with the failure rate built in is what sits back what is the Wall Street Journal story that interacts my attention the VCS and priced it in 17 minutes I put this up at 3 30 on Friday I have to 3 45 I get a call from a Wall Street Journal reporter that I noticed people sorry I said thank you for noticing she said I also noticed you estimated a value of six billion tools I said you're very reserved she said you do know that benching Captain is a value the company at 70 even and almost corrected are there but you know what I'd like to try to do is they don't value the price decided it's actually Journal stuff I said yes okay so how do you explain the seven people listen I don't have to explain it I didn't pay it I've never felt eager to explain what other people think don't try to do it just a lifetime of frustration so if somebody asked you why is somebody paying 23 coin unless you're the person who paid it don't really have to explain it but maybe they ever made a story they need to talk every valuation reflects your view your story it's not the story The evaluations your story your valuation should write your own decision and that's the way I really want to think about your valuation it's not so don't ask this is the right valuation question is this the valuation that I can face my decision as well 
thank you oh my God um foreign okay it's pretty good friends it's like reminder again reminder again that if you want the evaluation for feed you want to get feedback on your valuation you got to get it to me by when a week a week from Friday which happens to be the last day of this month okay so until 5 PM a couple of things on evaluation to have your attention please excellent but make it any louder I get too much of feedback a couple of things on the evaluation how many we have not added on your valuation let's try okay put up your head you know the most critical step in doing this is right getting started once you get started it's a question of you can get stuck and some of you might get stuck and if you get stuck I wanted to step back and gain perspective because ultimately you got to ask yourself how much time do I want to spend on this particular number when I you can always make an approximation and come back to the number you're stuck on so my advice is don't stay stuck and finally I know some of you feel the urge to build your own spreadsheet that won't stop you but it does make my life more difficult so I'm okay with that because it does mean I have to check your mechanics to make sure you're not adding something which you should be subtracting the alternative is to take my spreadsheet and adapt it so if you feel that it's not flexible enough you want to add an extra five years and make it 15 years you want to add three line items to revenues hey the spreadsheet is adaptable it's nothing proprietary about it so you know feel free to do that how many of you have done with the evaluation at least tentatively done okay Yuki what did you get as a value per share give me a rough number 900 euros okay so when you're done you're going to get a value per share so my first question today is you look at the value per share is it a value as of right now which would be what the you know Friday when you turn it in is it a value a year from now is it a value at the start of this calendar year you know why I picked the startup calendar year right what did you use as your financials probably through the end of 2022 yeah so it's just saying nothing or is it the start of the next calendar year maybe it's the end of 2020 what do you think the answer to that is when you do a DCF value what are you getting I know that's the the timing and consistencies right your risk-free rate your risk free might be as of right now but he's saying what about the fact that my financials are from three months ago or two months ago you are being consistent you know the consistency rule is you're using the most updated numbers you can get for every single input it's not your fault that accountants are update the numbers every every day okay but in equity research and I know some of you inspired am I trying to talk you out of it are going to end up in equity research you know the language that's used is they never talk about value today they talk about a Target price so you'll see right up there the Target price is what you expect the price to be a year from now so I'm going to be you're going to be in an interview I am an equity research analyst I'm going to looking to hire you as an analyst so you've taken this valuation class but we don't use this DCF value we want a Target price how would you convert a DCF value into an expected price a year from it lets you come up with a value 150 per share what would I need to do to convert it into a Target price it's all in your in that valuation of all the inputs you need what you need to do right back up back up it's uh you've come up with the value per share that's an equity value so you want to First multiply by one plus the cost of equity right because that's your expected return are you done that what is what goes into a cost of equity both the price depreciation portion and any dividends you might receive so basically you first have to augment the price by the expected cost of equity and then subtract out the dividends because otherwise it'll be double count you get both price appreciation dividends today we're going to go through that exercise but if you can do that for as a Target price at the end of year one I ask you what will the Target price be at the end of year two end of year three you can essentially you can Dazzle your interview you're saying you want just one year I can give you Target price in five years ten years it look like magic but basically all you're doing is taking your value per share and moving it across time so if you valued a company three years ago at fifty dollars and the stock right now is sixty five dollars you actually were very close to the right answer then because you take the fifty dollars and you grow the market cost of equity you're at 65 right now so remember that value is at a point in time usually as of the time you do the valuation but you can always move it back and forth across time by using the cost of equity as your compounding Factor so I'm going to go back to the last parts of the storytelling we remember I I ended the last session with my valuation of uber right and I said this is my story and my valuation the reason I use the word my is I don't want any of you say I have the valuation of a company nobody does nobody has The High Ground on this you have your story your valuation you know what it's going to drive my decisions so you don't like my story tell me wrong that is really the lesson I want you to take away from this is this is not my story for you to make decisions is my story for my own decisions I'm almost done to finish my story I feel pretty good about it when you show your story to other people what do you want them to do Pat you on the back and tell you how amazing this story is and if you hang out with people who think just like you that's exactly what you get right you'll all reinforce each other and say you know what this is The Way acoustic Capital should be computed and you've lost I think a golden chance to improve your evaluation so here's the final step I call it keeping the feedback loop open and let me use the Uber evaluation to illustrate what that even means so I finished my Uber evaluation June of 2014 the following week I get a call from a site called 530a.com go to the site it's Nate Silverside Nate silver used to be the polling person for the New York Times and then he's you know he's split off he created his own company it's now I think owned by ABC it's okay it's it's really a statistical geek set I'll give you an example of what they do you go to the hot hand in basketball but when somebody starts shooting and the ball keep going he's got a hard end so they say is that true they actually take the data and say is it true that when somebody is actually shooting well they continue to shoot well so that's the kind of thing they do so the editor of the site called me and they said you know what our site is not for finance people but this is the kind of thing they would like because it's built around numbers and connects to story you can run your poster they take the entire post with the valuation and poster of this act a day later I got a call from Forbes Magazine who reads Forbes Magazine probably 75 year olds with flip phones kind of an old person's site if you read Forbes don't take it personally but it is an old person they said you know what our old people really like this because it's show because they're always been skeptical about how these tech companies are being priced can we carry the process that be my guest same elevation gets carried then I get a third call on the same day it's from a site called TechCrunch what a TechCrunch TechCrunch is a digital magazine for Silicon Valley it's read by Tech Geeks he said are people are not Finance people but they're interested in Uber some of them work at Uber some of them own shares I mean our own parts of uber can we carry your post with the valuation I said be my guest and then I get a final call from somebody who claimed to be running a site called the right sharing guy I said what the heck do you do he said I write for Uber drivers and Lyft drivers you know how many of them there are right now there are about three million people around the world to drive for Uber and left so this guy writes for them he wrote wrote but what and he says our drivers would really love to see this because they work for Uber they drive through but they want to see how well Uber is doing I said beam I guess four sides pick up the same pose to the same valuation posted and I'm glad I did because I get four very different sets of feedback on the 538.com site this is the kind of feedback I get I looked at the evaluation I noticed it used the 90th percentile of the cost of capital but the 90th percentile is 11.97 you seem to have used 12 why this is what happens when numbers gigs get too close to numbers right second decimal point matters and the reason I leave my Excel spreadsheet open is I said why don't you go try 11.97 is your classic Capital see what happens and five minutes later I get an email saying nothing happened I see why he left it at 12 okay nothing learned by second decimal point questions I spent a couple of minutes on the forbesite I realized it's completely useless because they loved it they said this is so amazing nothing you're going to learn from people fighting about said this is the way tech companies be valued I skipped on I went to the TechCrunch site they had 400 comments and they did not like it their response was how dare you value one of ours with their D dot C dot f we don't do that in Silicon Valley so some of them are pure insults some of the insults I didn't even get you DCF guy that was one of the insults that's it the whole thing you DCF guy and said that was it good is that bad okay I'll take it yeah but after you got past the first 100 insults the 101st comments started with an insult and then I said oh by the way I work in this data business and I can tell you how the networking how Uber said search pricing remember I'm not I'm not a ride sharing I'm not an expert in any of the companies I've had doesn't stop me from valuing companies I've known nothing about infrastructure investment but I valued atani Enterprises I couldn't tell you how to build an electric car but that doesn't stop me from buying Tesla but simply there are people out there who know a lot a lot more almost about almost every aspect of what I'm valuing than I do so the TechCrunch guys I learned a great deal about the technology of ride sharing but I had to get past the incense that's a feedback loop staying open and then I went to the right sharing guys side and that's a very interesting things about Uber things I would never have learned if I just talked to the top Management in all my years of value companies I've never talked to top management you're going to see in a minute why I heard from an Uber driver in LA and he said I noticed to use the 20 share of the fare as their revenue which is what Uber told investors they kept he said in La here's what's happening until three months ago I used to drive for Lyft Uber paid me three thousand dollars to switch now Lyft is offering me five thousand dollars to switch back I feel like a free agent without a contract by the time all of this is said and done he said I'd be surprised if they kept more than seven or eight percent of the fare you know what five years later Uber leaks that their contribution margin is 7.7 percent my reaction was I knew that five years ago an Uber driver in L.A told me that's a feedback loop staying open so two weeks after this feedback kicks in I you know I'm on a trip to Europe I'm stuck in Munich Airport waiting for a flight and it's delayed and I make the mistake of opening up my email and checking to see what the emails that have come in are and I notice I have an email from a gentleman named Bill Gurley is a partner at Benchmark capital one of the highest profile VCS in Silicon Valley but Benchmark Capital was one of the First Investors in Uber they invest in Uber at a one billion dollar pricing Bill Gurley sat on the board of directors at Uber he was rumored to be the person closest to Travis galactic to the CEO of uber let me ask you it's the easy question does Bill Gurley know more about Uber than I do absolutely so open the email and here's how it begins I just read your blog post nobody did not like it okay we got that out of the way so I've written my own blog post to counter your blog post it's blog post blog post Warfare very 21st century and he said I've said some mean things about you and I just wanted to let you know sincerely bill a close email two hours left of my flight guess where I go next I go to the site called above the crack that's Bill's side he's six feet six inches tall that is about the crowd I must be below the crowd then rename my site and here's the lead article you can still find it on Google search if you type the motor and misses by a mile get it Uber driving my GPS is not working I kind of got and essentially took issue with every part of my valuation he said Uber is not a Car Service Company it's a logistics company notice how words have consequences what is logistics cover it covers car service obviously it covers delivery covers moving magically made the company a bigger business he said it's not just Urban it's going to be everywhere and he gave examples of suburban Services he throwed mentions of mirrors in the cars I didn't want to read any further etc etc et cetera rural and finally he said we're trying to connect up with Airlines and credit card companies so that when you fly out of New York on United to Jakarta after you make your reservation there will be a little box that says do you want Uber car waiting for you in Jakarta very clever way of saying we're going to take our domination in New York and translate it it's a way of making your local networking benefits into Global Network benefits took me 15 minutes to read the post I was fascinated along the way he took swipe said me but who cares I've been swiped by far worse so I finished the post and sitting still in Munich Airport I emailed them I said bill it's a fascinating story would you want me to put a number on your story he said what are you talking about I said he told a big story about Uber I can convert to a number he said be my guest Temple at my laptop open up my Excel spreadsheet and here's what I change remember that 100 billion dollar market that I was going after in my original I replaced with the 300 billion dollar market that includes Logistics Transportation much bigger potential market for that 10 market share I gave because of local networking benefits their Global networking benefits there'll be three ride sharing companies dominating the work they gave them a 40 market share the value that I got is 53 bit so still sitting in Munich Airport this is a long way I send the Excel spreadsheet back to Bill and said do you like this more you said a lot and he said by the way that 20 share of the fare that's not long for the world to be closer to ten percent I almost told him that Uber driver in La already told me but I said that's easy to fix it's an input into my spreadsheet I've made the 20 into 10 and I came up with a value of 29 but so how can the same company be worth 6 billion 28 of 53. there's only one value out there but they're all plausible stories right are you afraid the story can lead you a different value in fact in December of 2014 I wrote my fifth I I built Uber for all I was words I wrote five posts and over in 2014 alone so December of 2014 I got sick and tired of people picking on my story I don't like your growth rate I don't understand I said finally you know what that's my story you want to make it your story I'll do a do-it-yourself valuation of Tesla and here's what I did I said you picked the story so to each stage I would stop and say you tell me what business Uber is it is it a car service business is it a logistics business a transportation business or is it an on-demand business so what's an on-demand business you need something in a hurry they do it for you you are you're in a in your bed you have to go to the bathroom but you're too lazy an on-demand company will come to carry you to the bathroom and carry you back no it's basically whatever you feel too lazy to do the on-demand company will do for you I'll tell you the company that comes closest to non-demand companies a company called go check it's an Indonesian company I'll give you an example of services go check offers New Avengers movies opening tomorrow lines are going to be two hours long you're too busy you're working you can't spend two hours go check will hire somebody to stand in line for you sounds very easy no it almost sounds like medieval right you're letting slaves standing for you but basically they're taking advantage of the fact that how people value time is very different that somebody might value their time more code check will do for you if you get a chance if any of you value even if you're not failing go check take a look at the company it's you know their ride sharing is actually guys on motorcycles and scooters you know what right have you ever seen Jakarta traffic you can get in a car you're not going anywhere so they go in and out so I said you picked and I said do you think they have Global networking benefits local networking benefits or no networking benefits you pay do you think they have strong competitive advantages we do you think that drivers are employed so basically at each stage they say you pick and then at the end of the process I estimated what the value would be given the choices they made and guess what depending on the story you tell the value can be anywhere from less than a billion to more than 90 billion now when I put this out people said this is why you shouldn't do discarded cash flow evaluation because you can get any value you want that's not the way I read it the way I read it is especially with the other companies there can be significant disagreements of that value and those disagreements are not about your growth rate is different from mine it's because we're telling different stories about the same company let's make that debate about the story it's a much healthier debate than my saying I use 50 growth rate use 40 growth rates what does that even mean the feedback loop is critical because it allows you to reassess your story and say okay maybe I should finish this I'll give you I mean I I it makes life a lot more fun if you're doing valuation to have a feedback loop up I remember when I valued beyond meat so no remember it went public for the first time the first thing I did before I even sat down and thought about a story I went to the local grocery store I went to the frozen food section and picked up three packets of beyond meat because what's a big claim to fame they use pea proteins to produce something that is insanely close to meet you could say is that true I don't even like me but I want to say is that true and it is in fact it's too much like me it's it's like gross looking meat but it tastes you know if you like medium rare you know you get the medium rare feeling and I'll tell you my moment of Awakening with Uber is my original story for Uber always it'll attract people like my son and my niece young people who don't like caps that's what my original valuation was and ended up going back to India in 2015 for something and I went back to my home I grew up and and my mother was conservative South Indian woman program now we have to go out somewhere and she says you know she no usually do her version of going out you open the door of a driver bring the car out yeah instead of doing that she picks up a phone it's a smartphone Mommy have a smartphone she's not hitting buttons I said what are you doing she said I'm calling an Uber I said I can't come with you I have to go back and revalue the company if your mother is using Uber you got the market completely wrong right okay so if you look at my valuations of uber and in fact take a look at my June 2019 you see my potential Market is white because let's face it Uber has changed the car service business in ways that I did not see in 2014 bill and I are friends now because we run into each other and I I know I I look you know I'm glad you wrote that because in my valuation since I've learned so my Airbnb valuation that is the lesson I brought in using a much bigger Market but I also tell them look I got the margin story much better than you did because you thought it was going to be easy to get to profits and they have it so you got the growth story I got the margin story let's see where we end up at the end of this process but it would make this process a lot more interesting if you keep the feedback loop of it that's why I spent more time with Uber drivers than I should because this is my research I'm thinking of actually writing off all my Uber rides I said tax deductible Express okay I'm doing research come on I am doing research right in fact I use Disney in my applied corporate finance class as my lab experiment and I spent four days in Disney World maybe I could write off everything I spend in Disney why did you spend twenty dollars on the corn dog I had to do research shipping this is part of my applied corporate finance class I don't think the IRS will accept that no but that's the feedback loophole so on Friday you're going to be turning in your story and your valuation reflecting what you think about the company relax enjoy the weekend because on Monday things will happen which could change your story generically there are three things that can happen to your story one is your story can break what happened some event either within or without the company can cause the entire story to come Crashing Down I'll give you the most obvious case because you have a small pharmaceutical company with a drug working its way through the pipeline for diabetes and you detach a high value expecting big revenues and then you open up the Wall Street Journal on Monday and it says the most recent test of that drug three people have died and the Drug's been pulled off the testing there goes your company right oh here's another example a little company called Ashley Madison it's a company for cheaters people want to cheat on their spouses you cheat with other cheaters so it's a big cheating set it's attached to 1.8 billion dollar valuation lots of cheaters in the world and then something catastrophic happens does anybody know what happened data data leak you know what happens when your business is built around the cheating business and the data leaks the 1.8 billion became 300 million all of a sudden because some people stayed on because to them this was actually good they wanted the world to know how big they were cheating so where the biggest seedless look I have 15 000 episodes did there wouldn't you wouldn't have cared right this is but she but Ashley Madison biggish that's a story break you can have your story what does that mean your basic story stays the same but the Contours of the story chain Revenue growth might go up margins might change because of things happening around you I've told pretty much the same story invaling Apple between 2012 and 2021. and my story for apple is it's a slow growing cash machine when you look at Apple as a company what is the bulk of its value come from what does it produce what product does the Bank of Israeli come from 75 of this value comes from the iPhone so if you got that MacBook Pro and you're wondering why they spend so little time on you this has become almost a side game for them right you think so what 10 years ago the smartphone business was a growing business because people were shifting away from flip phones to smartphones those days are done the slow growth is coming to the fact that they're one of the two big players in the market in the Samsung going to include Androids and they're different manufacturers they're not going to get 20 growth in the business because everybody has a smartphone and you either have to get somebody with a with an Android phone to switch to you or get somebody to upgrade and you're not going to get the 20 call slow growth why cash machine because I I think you know when I look back at all of the products I've looked at over that no product has thrown off as much cash flow as the iPhone is I'll give you an example of how much of a cash machine it is Apple has bought back a half a trillion dollars in stock Buybacks in the last five years 500 billion dollars and while doing it they increase their market cap by a trillion dollars you know how difficult that is that's like chopping off pieces of your body and becoming fatter at the same time how do you do that that's what a cash machine will do for you they can't give the cash back fast enough but that doesn't mean my valuation stays exactly the same but it doesn't shift dramatic the story stays roughly the same your valuation concept so what could cause my Apple evaluation to shift something dramatic an Apple Watch can't do it you see why the collective total market for the Apple watch even if everybody had an Apple Watch like a hundred value when you're a 2 trillion or two and a half trillion dollar company having a market of 100 billion is like any change you got to have so once you get to the size of Apple you can already see to get high growth you have to go after a really big market and many of those big markets are markets that Apple doesn't want to go into it doesn't want to be in the electric car market it's a nasty messy manufacturing Market do you think Apple's heart is in the entertainment business because what's uh it's good the Apple streaming is it's actually it's a really good streaming but you can see the hot snot in it you're not sure why they're even doing it no clearly it's not going to create the value that changes the value of a two and a half trillion I'm sure there's some Insidious plan in the in the in the long term but I'm too tired to think about what that plan might be so I keep looking and I look at that the only business that's kind of altered a little bit my story for apple is the growth of the the Apple Services business which is everything that flows through the App Store is incredibly profitable to have it's in fact the reason that who is it that a problem with which uh fortnite I think had you know they pulled had to pull the game pull the game off because Apple takes a slice Big Slice 30 of everything that goes through the store so story change you got the basic story the same but the Contour scripture but you can also have a storyship where a company does something and he said really I didn't think it could do that I'll tell you what could change my valuation of Tesla if next quarter or the next year they report they got a half a billion dollars in revenues from robots right that's in fact the Tesla bot is something that they've introduced in their own factories and businesses like manufacturing and Mining with a lot of repetitive work a robot might actually do that that's a big business it could potentially alter the value of the company so what I'm trying to say is you get a story you get evaluation but you're keeping your eye open for what could change that story shifts story changes and story breaks any questions on storytelling okay well how many fifth this is session 15 of the class right it is session 15. I know I just wanted to see whether you you were more than halfway through this class okay how many companies have we actually valued in this class there's a valuation of the week not in class we have it valued a single company yet you should ask for your money back question I don't know whether NYU does this you think I took a valuation classroom valued no companies in class right so I'm going to remedy them part of the reason I had to wait is if you don't lay the groundwork then jumping into valuation too as soon as the most dangerous thing you could so what I'm going to do is actually value companies and I'm going to lay the groundwork as you go through these valuations and you're going to see about 20 25 companies being valued you're going to see Equity risk premiums come out and they're going to keep changing why because depending on when I did the valuation the equity risk reflect the equity risk premium as of that point in time so pre-2000 or pre-1998 I used to use a lot of five and a half percent premium some of you notices when you looked at the old quizzes five and a half percent premiums that shifted down to four shifted up to six and it'll keep shifting depending on when I do the valuation usually reflectively implied premiums as of that point in time so when you compare the valuations and you say why the Erp is different in every single valuation it's because they were done at different points in time second with each company I'm going to introduce the valuation with a story why because I want to stay true to this notion that every evaluation story so I want to tell you the story I'm telling for the company and then use that story to come up with the inputs that drive the valuation so let's start simple let's put training wheels on I'm going to start with a really simple company to value companies called Con Ed does what does it do I don't know once in a while they forget Brooklyn and there's a power outage but most of the time they provide for a power to most of the city you know all these lights are corn headlights it's a regulated utility what does that mean the regulated Monopoly action and they're the only game in town now of course you have all these other companies that claim but they're not very easily only game in that corner now usually as a monopoly what you worry about is price increases regulate in terms of the pricing and how does the Regulatory Commission decide whether to grant them a price increase or not what do they look at they look at the return in equity Con Ed makes and actually compared to the cost of equity this is the one business where cost of equity remember there is create a beta screen actually have consequences and they try to make sure you don't earn more than your cost of equity that's the regulated Monopoly part and how quickly is New York City's New York State's population growing it's not it's a it's a mature part of the country in terms of population size this is all going to lead into what I'm going to do I'm going to Value Con Ed as a stable growth why because it's not like power usage it's going to go up 10 15 they can't afford they don't have the capacity to even they'll actually talk you down if you try to use up use up too much power in fact when you have really hot days in the summer the ingredients you don't please please please don't use your air conditioner it might blow up the system we don't want to build another plan to cover this so almost they don't want to grow so the growth is going to be low because you're catering to a population that's pretty simple but I'm going to Value them not just a sustainable Growth Company but I'm going to Value them as a stable Growth Company using a stable growth dividend discard model you know the nice thing about a stable growth dividend discount model is the only three numbers you need expected dividends next year cost of equity at the growth rate you're saying I think I would use a stable growth dividend discount model for my company this sounds easy before you use it though you got to pass some debts to make sure it is a company so it can't adhere the tests are in first is is this company paying dividends like a mature stable Growth Company what am I looking for I'm looking to see whether the payout ratio is high enough to be compatible with if I see a payout ratio of 10 I know already a stable growth dividend discount model is not going to work because this company is not behaving like a mature company in the case of connect that percentage is 73 so Con Ed is paying out 73 of its earnings as dividends which means that reinvesting 27 remember the fundamental growth equation take the retention ratio multiply by the return equity and because con it almost by regulation earns its cost of equity the return Equity of 7.7 percent is set equal to the cost the expected growth you get is 2.1 I think I can use that as a stable growth rate how do I make the judge whether that growth rate is okay what do I compare it to or the risk free rate right remember we said the risk so in this case you look at the 2.1 percent 4.1 percent risk free rate using a 2.1 growth rate and perpetuity is going to be so they're paying dividends like a mature company they're growing at a rate less than the growth rate of the economy fun question to ask is is there beta and cost of equity compatible with a mature company what does that mean if I see a beta 1.8 and a debt ratio of 92 percent I'm going to hold back and say maybe there's something they need to fix first that wasn't the case in the case of Con Ed databate of 0.8 and a cost of equity of 7.7 okay I think I can use a stable growth dividend discount model I take the expected dividend next year two dollars and 32 cents is the dividend the most recent 12 months I grow it out one year at 2.1 percent why because every present value equation needs cash flows one euro and I divide by the cost of equity 7.7 minus that's I'm done it's a value per share value Pusher is 42.30 the stock is trading at 40.76. am I surprised that the values close the price this is as close to a bond as you're going to get in the stock market right it's a big dividend paying company with low growth I'm not surprised but I'm still finding the company to be slightly underband right so let's take what that exercise we did the start of the class about what will the price be one year from now the value per share for the company is 4230 right that's my discounted cash flow value if I asked you what the Target price will be one year forever somebody lead me through the process even if you can't give me the number what am I going to do we take the 4230 and which is 7.7 so 4230 times 1.077 it's one final step what's the last thing I need to do minus the expected dividend which is what 232 growing at 1.02 or 2.1 percent I'm going to come up with like 44 dollars in something so if you want you can check it on your calculator so basically I'm taking the 40 to 30 drawing it at 7.7 and subtracting the expected of it let's say I come up with 44 30. people often say well if my stock price is 40 76 and I'm buying it at 40 that doesn't sound like much money it's only a dollars but if you go out and buy the stock now you're going to pay 40.76 if you actually end up with 44 dollars in something which is what you should if you if your value is right I'm going to end up with a return of about 13 on corner and if you can make a 13 return on Con Ed you're way ahead of the game so if you want to convert discounted cash flow values to Target prices you have the mechanism in the spreadsheet to do it in fact add an extra line if you wanted the spreadsheet and get expected Target pricing year one year two year three because it's it's very doable with the cost of equity right in front of you any questions on the tournament now even with the company where everything seems pretty stable and easy to predict has gone it I could be wrong right my growth rate could be wrong my discount rate could be wrong expected dividends next year might be a little too high or low when you do a valuation you can solve for any input you want to make the value equal to the price in other words you can reverse engineer your discounted cash flow evaluation to deliver it's like solving for any number like enough usually we solve for this concrete called it the irr but you can solve for any input you want in this case one of the things that I did was I did change the growth rate for the company to see what growth rate I would need to get to the stock price today it's called an imputed growth rate but you can then use it to decide how much buffer you have in your estimate so this is an easy evaluation mature slow Growth Company paying 73 of its earnings is dividends you come up with the value per share I can almost I was looking through the list of your companies and nag if you haven't entered your name there are about 50 of you haven't put the name of your company in which either means that you haven't picked a company which terrifies me or you pick the company and you're ignoring me which pisses me off or you pick the company and you entered it in there and it got removed by somebody else in the class in which case I'm paranoid at this stage whatever it is go fix it but here's the name of your company and I was looking at the list and I don't think very many of you are going to be able to use a stable growth dividend but the second company I'm going to value is going to be a little more difficult but not that much more so the company called 3x incredibly boring things that make a ton of money I did amazing Post-it note the guy who invented this imagine I mean Biko actually got the claim and every post is notepad even in this digital age look at how many Post-it notes there are but boring so this is a valuation I did on September 12th of 2008 during the day what do I care when you do it you know what except number was September 12th was a significant day right after close of trading on September 12 2008 Lehman Brothers came out with the news release that they were in deep trouble they were looking at Barclays buying them out over the weekend Barclays never bought them out and on Monday we woke up to the 2008 crisis I would love to tell you that I saw it coming not even on my Horizon maybe nuriel saw it coming but he sees it coming all the time you know rabbini is looking at his window he sees the crisis coming Bitcoin collapsing but he's like Eeyore he sees crises around every corner so I value the company completely oblivious to the storm approach this is nice so the story I would go for 3M in 2012 is this nice solid company with products that deliver incredible returns and capital I think the return Captain they had was close to 25 percent growing at a reasonably High rate for the given the size of the company not a but particularly in terms of an easy evaluation I plugged the numbers and I came up with the value of 83.65 by itself there's nothing particularly interesting or Difficult about this valuation basically this is one of those valuations we could just take Excel spreadsheets and project them on come up with eighty four dollars then I went home that day and I come back on Monday of course the world is falling apart so two weeks later I'm valuing 3M again none of the numbers somebody have changed the same results but the world around me has changed I there's this this Canard that intrinsic values Timeless that somehow once you value company it can't change what absolute nonsense because when the world changes around you your intrinsic value will change and in a crisis what are the first things that are going to shift your risk premiums the equity risk premium of four and a half percent that I used before has now become six percent the default spread I used before has gone up not because the rating has changed but because the price of risk in the bond market has changed cost of capital has changed because we're in a crisis and as this crisis unfortunate it's quite clear that it's going to bring the economy down too will that affect 3F yes people buy fewer posted notes why because you don't have a job what the heck are you posting about no might as well sit at home stay in bed don't get out it's kind of depressing but no that's what you're going to do it's not going to be huge right maybe some people need the posted in order to get depressed they write more and more nodes to themselves it don't be depressed do things so that's the but the growth drops up so think about the effects same company four weeks later in a crisis I use a higher discount rate reflecting the higher price of risk lower growth rate and perpetuity risk free rates have come down and a lower growth rate the value that I get per share is 61 think about it I've taken the same company with the same numbers in over four weeks the values gone from 84 to 61. not because the company has changed but because of macro environment is changed here's my prayer for you that you don't face a crisis like this between next Friday and May 8th but if you do you know what you need to do right because don't do what most people do throw up the answer I can't do a thing it's a crisis it's actually relatively easy to adjust for a crisis it just means go in and adjust your risk premium it's an input so you know use a risk premium that reflects the fact that you're in a crisis you know if you have a higher cost of capital you're if you're in a crisis the t-bond rate might drop it remember that is Ripple effects in your growth rated perpetuity now be willing to adapt when things change around you because your value per share will change it's it's a good it's a good exercise to go through nothing else to allow you to see how macro variables affect and how many of your value backs any bit how many are valuing bags here anybody value go back nobody wants to admit to it but it doesn't have to be silicon it could be any bad right Silicon Valley bad of course is a disaster but it's if you have any JP Morgan Chase what happened at Silicon Valley Bank is going to have an effect on evaluation in good ways and bad ways what are the good ways it doesn't even have to be silly if you're worried about small and Regional Banks guess what you're shifting your money into big Banks so there is an argument that big banks are going to see an inflow of deposits the bad news is this is going to come with new regulations and restrictions on banks so that might have to come into your Capital requirements and how much your return Equity is over the last week your value has shifted but no fault of your back but because the world around them has changed we'll do one more valuation to kind of clean up this process so valued 3M my valued content they're both confidence right can I value the S P 500 in a value in index does an index have cash flows yeah if I bought the entire index you could buy an index fund I get cash flow so the index of growth of companies in the index grow does the index have risk it's actually easier to do it for an index because it's a beta is going to be pretty close to one if it's an index like the s p 500. so what I'm going to do is take the S P 500 and try to Value we're going to do some market-wide valuation why would you want to do that you want to ask the answer the question is Market overvalued or undevalued right now it's something I don't try to do because I'm not a market timer but I want to give you the tools to be able to do so let's set the table up this was in September of 2022 inflation had now become this leading player in the game the index was down and I wanted to see whether the index was under or overvalued given all the macro leaves so as I looked at the basic index here's how I'm going to build up to get my expected earnings in future years I want to start with my base year earnings and I'm going to apply a growth rate it's very similar to what I did with the implied Equity risk premiums if there I was solving for the equity restroom here I'm going to try to Value the index so I get expected earnings then I also have to estimate what percentage of the earnings will get paid out as dividends in BuyBacks and discount them back at a cost of equity which level risk-free written and Equity risk-free you say where's the beta going it's the S P 500 there's no beta beta is what so there are five inputs in here right I have earnings earnings growth percentage of earnings it'll be paid out as cash flows a t-bond rate in equity restricted every story you tell about markets is to flow through one or more of those five areas so here were the big questions in 2008 I'm sorry September 2020 20 um September 2022. the way I'm getting estimates of growth is I'm looking for an analysts are predicting the future and it's by September 2022 there was talk that a recession was gone so the big question is are analysts incorporating the expected effects of a recession sufficiently or are they overestimating growth that's the first question second with inflation becoming a bigger player and things becoming more uncertain our company is going to return less cash to give you a sense of 2021 U.S companies returned about 90 percent of their earnings as dividends of BuyBacks why so hard because I felt pretty good about themselves they felt the economy was nice and predictable but if they feel the economies become more unpredictable maybe they'll pay less so that's the second question third as inflation Rises or false what will happen to the demon notice how I didn't phrase the question I'd say I was a bad meet said decide I don't care if inflation is going to be the Big Driver I would think about how it will play out and finally given that higher inflation usually goes with more uncertainty about inflation what will that mean for the output risk rate those are the four big questions so let's start with the earnings question so these are the earnings estimates that analysts were projecting for the S P 500 and the percentage change those earnings as well basically I'm saying how much are analysts weighing because we started 2022 with nobody talking about a recession by September 2022 everybody was talking about a recession so I wanted to see how much analysts were building that into audience and the answer was not much if you look at the changes and earnings we started the error 223.34 by September it was up to 225.34 and you can do that with changes both for this year and the next year analysts didn't seem to be in the same room as the people claiming to be making that there was going to be a resection either the analysts are wrong or the macro economists are wrong and for the moment I'm just I'm just setting that on the table second if you look at how much of those earnings get returned the dividends this looks at the percentage of the S P 500 that gets paid out in dividends and BuyBacks over time so 2001. U.S companies that's the.com past year returned about 41 of their earnings in dividends in BuyBacks across the entire period that statistic is about a if you look at the percentage that's paid up has been about 83 percent so over the 2000 through 2022 period U.S companies have returned about 83 percent and in 2021 in particular the most recent year they were up to so so if you look at Bike by quarter they were at about 80 percent so companies seem to have said it returning 80 to 85 percent perhaps even as high as 90 in some years because they feel comfortable third if you look at the how this plays out in the story and this is my S P 500 story again it's not the S P 500 story so if I would no I in September 2022 my argument is analysts are underestimating the impact of a recession or not except the earnings are going to be lower than they're projecting for whatever reason they seem to so I'm going to use earnings that are lower than the analyst estimates I do believe that come can't afford to continue to return cash the way they were in the 12 months leading September 2022. why they were turning almost 90 percent of earnings as in dividends in violence with higher inflation more uncertain inflation I'm going to assume it's going to be about 80 percent and it's going to happen over time I did assume that over the long term the equity risk premium would converge around five percent five percent if you think about long do you remember that graph I showed you for the implied premium going back all the way to 1960. the average is about four percent but I think we're going to end up around five percent which is close to what it's been for the last 20 years and finally I made the Assumption and this is what you need to do I don't this is why I don't like to value industry it's because you have to make macro assumptions about inflation and interest rates but there's no choice I have to assume that inflation will steady at about three three and a half percent which will lead me to a t-bond rate of four percent I value the index with those assumptions the value that I got for the index was actually pretty close to where the index was then I came up with an index value of 35.50 but differently analysts might be over optimistic they might be biased upwards in their earnings but guess what the market is doing it's incorporating more realistic assumptions about earnings so don't mistake analysts for the market there's this amazing thing that seems to happen you take a hundred crazy dumb people you put them in a room the collective wisdom that can emerge from that room sometimes they all go crazy anyway right because stupidity averages out it cuts in both directions people are seeing stupid things in both directions it's one of the law of large numbers that's why you trust your young previews right but let's face it if you individually met any of those reviewers you're saying what the heck am I doing listening to this person who's never eaten Chinese food telling me this is the best Chinese food they've ever had but you get a thousand people who've never eaten Chinese food they average across the thousand people it seems to be amazing it's crowd wisdom crowds can also go crazy but crowd wisdom so markets are far smarter than individual analysts or even animals collectively and that's what I so if you want an update I have a 20 January 2023 update of my valuation but the bottom line is this value is a function of my assumption the function of what I'm assuming what what will happen to inflation and what will happen to you so this table actually what I did was I essentially took you know what what what could happen during the severe recession a modern recession or no recession and what could happen inflation so what's your most benign scenario that inflation will go back down to two percent and that the economy will not go into recession in which case the value you get for the index could be much much higher especially Equity risk creams revert back every statement you're about markets is a conditional statement implicitly you're making assumptions about risk-free rates and risk premiums that's one reason I don't try to retire markets there is nothing special you or I are going to bring to the table when you're looking at the S P 500 you value the individual company you might say look up down research people might be ignoring this what the heck can I come up with on the S P 500 that the crowd already has a success that's at the core of do you want in time markets or not can I value your markets yes will I act on those valuations no I don't feel there's anything special that I'm bringing other than an understanding why markets are weather but if you want you can download that valuation spreadsheet the S P 500 and play games with you know changing the inflation rate changing the economic growth rate and see how it plays out so now we're going to approach what I call the dark side evaluation of all my books this is a title I like the most it's a book that I wrote In 2001 and before the.com Buster the peak of the.com boom and I'll explain in a minute what why I call it the Dark Side of valuation but to understand why why I call it the dog said I'm going to go back to the start of the class I said in every valuation there are four questions you try to answer what kind of copy first is what are my cash flows from existing assets so when you look at the existing income statement balance sheet statement of cash for the company that's yeah I'd say you're looking for what is my what are my existing Investments ranking that's the easiest of the four questions to answer second question is what is the value that is added or taken away by Future growth why did I phrase the question that question when did this ask you what's your future growth because growth is a mixed blessing right higher growth pushes up my earnings and cash flows higher growth comes with the reinvestment the net effect is worth determine this is a much Messier question it's not just estimating a growth rate but the reinvestment that goes with the growth and tell you what this value added or not third question I'm going to ask is how risky are the cash flows and that's what's your beta beta might be your mechanism for dealing with risk but don't mistake models for ultimate big pictures even if you don't believe in the cap and invaded you still have to deal with risk how risky are you against and finally when will your company become a mature company why do I need that question what that what does that allow me to do what is a mature company you can use the terminal value calculation the growth rate is less than the growth rate of economy so I'm going to State the audience when those questions are easy to answer valuation becomes easy when those questions are difficult to answer well this is so obvious why are you even wasting our time telling you that did you take a cup like Coca-Cola what makes it easy to Value take those four questions you have lots of information on cash flows from existing assets assessing the value of growth becomes easy because you know what they do with them what their competitive advantages are you know lots of history for risk they're close enough to being mature companies can say it happened in your three or five in contrast you're wearing snowflake those questions all become nasty so the dark side evaluation happens whenever you're valuing companies where these questions become difficult to answer so let's look at some examples Bellingham companies take those questions you can already see by asking and answering those questions it's difficult how about companies that don't fit the accounting mode promissory covers what's the big deal r d which is a capex is treated in an operating sense I can't I have to remember all that that the process we had to go through to capitalize expenses and finally companies that face significant truncations what is truncations now you do valuation and you estimate cash flows in year three you wonder is my year three cash flow going to be right or wrong or how wrong is it you know truncation risk is will there be a year three and it's scary other dimension right you see why First Republic is so difficult to Value it's not that you can't project dividends for the next 10 years you don't even know whether they'll be it next year we're not very good at valuing companies which are distressed we're not very good at valuing companies that could be nationalized because it's truncation so let's start with the you know as you look through here's what I'm going to do I'm going to go through the list of companies I want to try to Value trying to capture companies in the dark side first I'm going to start with looking across the life cycle I'm going to start with young companies including startups what makes them difficult to Value why are these questions how do we deal with it next I'm going to move on to mature companies that are in transition you know what I mean by that you have a mature company is trying to become different it's trying to do something different how do you deal with the changes that I come and finally I'm going to Value declining companies these are the companies where after you value them you feel like you need to take a shower Bed Bath and Beyond you value the company you need multiple showers you just you know I don't really you feel depressed but somebody's got to do the dirty job we value declining companies I also want to talk about what makes Emerging Market companies trickier to value and finally I want to talk about sectors our banks easy to value and a stupid question now you think you know what in 2005 when I wrote my one of my valuation textbooks I had a chapter in value Banks and I start with the sentence I have never quite lived at Valium bags is easy that's how this is the chapter starts it was built on a premise it was built on two premise the first premises Banks were run by sensible people and the second is that Banks were covered by regulatory authorities would stop Banks from doing really stupid things you see why it was 2005. that that illusion lasted until 2008 when we woke up to a nightmare the banks are run by some of the least sensible people on the face of the Earth and the regulatory framework doesn't seem to work so I'm going to tell you what how I used to Value Banks before 2008 power value Banks after 2008 perhaps how I need to revalue Banks after 2023 with the Silicon Valley Bank experience I want to talk about value in commodity and cyclical competition even the most mature commodity companies is volunteering right earnings go up and down what causes Exxon mobil's earnings go up India price of oil it's a macro Factor cyclical companies the same way so I'm going to talk about value in those companies and finally companies with intangible assets we talked about capitalizing r d i want to show you the implications of capitalizing r d on the value of a company like Angel so we have a lot on our plate let's get the process started at least I want you to be an entrepreneur and you just created this young company to start up lots of promise you ready so you're the entrepreneur I'm going to come and ask you the four questions here's my first question what are your cash flows from existing assets what's hands are going to be what existing ads they're over on the chair I said maybe that's the only thing of value the whole place is what the does Herman Miller chairs you took your entire book Equity you invest in one chair you have a comfortable place to sit good answer the first question is I didn't have any cash flow no existing ads so that was easy and now if you watch your value from future growth you say a lot he said can you be a little more specific not really right you don't have to even picked a product you don't know what the market is and ask how risky are you you said very but beyond that what can you show me there's no beta no history of earnings nothing you can show so when will you be a mature company you fall out of the chair laughing you don't even know whether you'll make it through next week you have no cash to meet payroll now do you see why most people don't even try to value on companies every input becomes this exercise and I have no idea and let's make this even worse let's suppose you're a company in a sector where every other company looks just like you you're all young companies you're all small revenues money losing no business models it's what I call the the valuation Trifecta here's what you get right because think about the places you go or you've gone already to value your company what's the first thing you've pulled up as raw material to Value company 10K annual report financial statements and then presumably because you have access to Capital IQ you pulled update on the sector or you looked at my margin so basically looked at industry averages so you look at the company you look at its history to see what it did during the last recession you look at compromise one by one I'm going to knock your crutches up let's suppose you have a young company so you don't have much history it's a young company very early the life cycles current financials tell you very little and then you look at the second they're all companies just like yours they're all young companies early in the life cycle this is when the dark side Rebecca no the dark side who said things like valuation doesn't matter in this sector and you start saying you'd start sounding like Kathy Wood and I ask you why should I buy the company you talk about how big the market is why should I buy Tesla electric cars everybody's going to have an electric car pushed out Facebook with my daughters on Facebook all all day long what does it have to do with whether I should buy Facebook or not you tell macro stories every time I ask you about the company it's a macro story why should I buy artificial intelligence I don't even know what to do with that macro stories I remember when um Alibaba went public and I valued it as the China store because it is really the China story a company that essentially if you think about why Alibaba beat out eBay and Amazon in China it basically understood that what worked in the US and Europe would not work in China in fact I think the best description I saw of Alibaba when it went public was The Economist described it as as the bizarre the Chinese bizarre have you seen the group when you open up Google you know what the page looks like a simple clean one box nothing because that's the way it's supposed to be have you ever been in a Bazaar bazaars are anything but simple it's it's people yelling at you in 70 different directions come on I'll give you a 50 discount all prices are negotiable if you grew up in Asia you grew up with bazaars if you get a chance open up the cowboy taobao opening side put on sunglasses before you do it because it'll be like a bang in your face but in a sense Alibaba said this is what Chinese consumers want is they want a Bazaar and they created alipay because they've discovered that Chinese consumers were a little reluctant in those days leave credit card information on a site because they're afraid you'd rip them off so when Alibaba went public I described the Chinese story with all the pluses it had seven 75 of all online retail traffic in China you know flew through I mean went through an Alibaba so I valued it as an Alibaba as a Chinese story I gave it you know reflected the revenue growth coming from the Chinese online retail Market growing and it came up with the value of like 116 billion which I thought was a it's the largest value ever attached to a company going public at the time of going up so I put the valuation up and then CNBC calls and says you know Alibaba is going public tomorrow or two or two days from now will you come on and talk to you know talk to us about it and they never told me and not like all you know there's a room called The Green Room which is neither green nor a room but this is like the terminology that they use you come and wait there at some point in time it must have been Green in the room but you go to CNBC they make you wait there I sit there and this guy walks in and he's an equity research I've seen him on TV before he says what are you here for I said talk about Alibaba he said oh that's a coincidence I'm talking about Alibaba too so okay we're probably both on the same panel so I you know they asked me first and I go through this first childhood story and I said 160 billion I have governance issues but this is what and he says no no it's got to be at least twice that number yeah then I said why that's China and I said can you be a little more specific there's China in my story too but this is the macros or it's China so let's double the number today they might have the number because depending on the point in time they worry about it they add value to it that's a macro second thing that happens is they talk about Paradigm ships you know what that means I basically can't explain what's going on so I'll call it a paradigm shift I've heard in my 40 years in finance I've seen seven different Paradigm shifts none of which actually stuck and finally you're going to see metrics you've never seen before like what when.com companies took off none of the traditional metrics worked price earnings ratios did not work right they're all losing money Revenue model doesn't work because the revenues were so tiny so you know what they started using market value a website visitor in about four years in Mary Meeker with that time of the equity research Anderson said this is so unsophisticated but some website visitors spend only a minute some spent 15 minutes we need to get market value per minute oh she called it market value for eyeball it's a computed market value for eyeballs for every internet company of course you want the low number and I still remember looking at those numbers saying what do I do with these numbers how do I know it's high 300 per eyeball I really like my eyeballs I would definitely pay at least 300 but what ex but you can see when you create these metrics that you've never seen before you have no frame of reference if I ask you to pay 500 times revenues for a company you're going to bark right so that's a high number five thousand times nothing no I'm not doing it three hundred dollars per eyeball oh you know what that sounds low let me just buy that's the dog stuff so every time the 1990s I used to Value companies I used to do my valuation seminar somebody come up to me very aggressively at the end of the session you really can't value amazon.com using a discounted cash flow model can you finger going like they're going to touch me at the risk of great personal injury I'd say yes you can value Amazon with a discounted cash flow model they give me this look of total condensing academic it's not a compliment academic is basically you really can't do this you can just talk about it after about the fifth or sixth number being called an academic I got really pissed off I actually sat down and valued amazon.com in 1997 for the first time and I kept a journal of my experiences of what I felt and what I had to deal with at every step it's still on my website it's called The Dark Side of valuation can amazon.com be valued that of course became the book four years later about rallying.com companies and the second edition and the Third Edition have come out and basically I've discovered the dark side lurks anytime you face a lot of uncertainty I'll wager that right now equity research analysts whose job it is to assess Banks who kind of thrown at their hands because that's what happens the dark side you throw up your hands because you say there's too much uncertainty I can't deal with it ask me again in six minutes so what do I do for the next six months so I'm going to take you back to January 2000. and take you through a valuation I did of Amazon in January 2000 and as you look at this valuation it's not fair using the benefit of hindsight because you could say oh my God you got those numbers of course I got the numbers absolutely wrong but I'm actually going to show you my comparison of what my projections were in 2000 what actually happened over the following 10 years I seldom do this because it can create psychological trauma to actually look at your forecast in the actual numbers but I'm going to do it anyway so this is evaluation of Amazon January 2000. actually did this for I don't have a CFA but I've been giving the keynote to the CFA for like 30 years I don't want to see a thing but this was one of the first webcasts that they did and said can you do a webcast for our members on how to value.com so let's lead into the valuation in January 2000 Amazon was a company with with 1.1 billion dollars in revenues so let me pause right there a U.S retail company is 1.1 billion dollars in Revolution I need Revenue just to give you perspective what do Walmart's revenues last year 500 billing and in 2000 Walmart's revenues are 150 200 billion Gap at 20 billion I mean basically one billion is Tiny Revenge and operating losses of 410 million so this is a company with small revenues and big operators you ready that's my question can a company with small revenues and big operating losses become a valuable company it's an easy question right yes so let's let's say simplistic what has to happen to the small revenues they have to come back I thought it was simplistic what has happened to the losses not just smaller they've got to change signs if they don't change signs you're in big trouble so the minus has to become this is so simplistic so basically what are the two first two big assumption value on companies Revenue growth because you got to make the small revenues into big revenues I'm giving you the roots of the fcff simple Kenzo spreadsheet because that small Revenue becomes big Revenue to revenue growth and a Target margin I know you're not going to get there next year or what you think your company can make once it gets past the bank that's my Revenue group 42 compounded Revenue growth rate every year for the next 10 years I remember when I was doing this as my at my webcast I hadn't even finished saying 42 when the foot they had to email the questions the old old technology and the first email question comes in how come you're being so pessimistic about future growth I said pessimistic I'm taking a billion dollars in revenues and making them 40 billion dollars by the time I'm increasing the revenue is 44. and I'm being accused to being pessimistic you know why uh they thought it was pessimistic right what were they comparing the 42 percent the growth in the most recent year which was 200 so how are you dropping it I wasn't dropping they missed the compounded in the 10 years the compounded growth rate is 42 but if you look at the actual Revenue growth it starts at 150 percent and it scales down why because as you get bigger you can't maintain those growth rates I thought I was big I was and I talk about why 42 why not 45 why not 36. so small Revenue Big Rapids uh my job is done I made Amazon at least in my spreadsheet a big company in terms of bread second I had to pick a margin that they would have in steady state he said why don't you just look at online retailer March do you know what that number would have looked like right they're all negative so I said look online is not a business retail is a business the business at three dates Amazon it has fundamental economics you cannot change I looked at the 75th percentile of regular retail companies and said you know what Amazon might have a lower cost structure their margins are going to converge on 10 percent over 10. right now the margin is minus 36.7 but over time that's going to become 10 so as you go from minus 36 to plus 10 it's almost magical I've made this company go from being a small money losing company into a large Monument see the amazing things you can do on spreadsheets why would anybody want to run a real company it went on a spreadsheet you could make a company the biggest company ever but there's one final who said and I end with this loser to get your revenues from a billion to 20 to 40. would require not just wet and tears but also reinvestment and I'll tell you this is where I got stuck when I first started value on companies I tried that reinvestment times return in capital you know what that looks like for Amazon it's a big negative number for reinvestment rate because the denominator is negative and a big negative number for return on Capital you're saying this is very convenient big negative multiplied by big negative makes it big positive but you take a loss and grow it it just becomes a bigger loss so finally I said why am I looking at operating income it's revenues that are driving the growth rate I'm going to time my reinvestment to revenues and hence was born the sales to Capital ratio I said I have to tell you how much you reinvested the revenues and to get that number I looked across retail companies and the sales to Capital ratio across retail companies was about three which means for every so every three dollars in additional revenues I need to invest my daughter income you know the advantage of doing this instead of forecasting capex and working capital and Acquisitions is I don't know what Amazon will have to reinvest it's too younger company Jeff Bezos did not know in 2000 what you'd have to reinvest when in doubt consolidate that's why when I do my young company valuation I actually have fewer line items than with larger companies because there's so much stuff you don't know that sometimes aggregating gives you a benefit so when we start on Monday I'm going to take those assumptions lay them out as cash flows and then talk about things you can learn from this numbers thank you goodness 
thank you okay folks time to get started a couple of reminders in case you need them the first is that you want feedback on evaluation try to get it into me by Friday I won't even set a time sometime Friday midnight Friday it's supposed over Saturday Sunday Saturday this is not some hard deadline I'd prefer to get it out of my way this weekend so that's why I wanted at the start of the weekend because next Monday you have something else on your plate right we already checked your calendars everybody there's no rest for the wicked so next Monday is your second quiz in case you haven't checked I will send this email out this year this evening with the second quiz review and past quizzes in case no but you need to be able you can't do both at the same time think of your evaluation as part preparation for your quiz and we'll make it a little easier so just those two things finally I've been checking the master list there are a few of you still haven't either picked the company or told me the company you've picked try to remedy that put the company in so that I want all 350 of you with companies next year names okay so let's talk about where we left off in valuation we valued 3M we valued coin ad we value the S P 500 and we started in the valuation of Amazon and that's where I'm going to continue but before I do that let's do a couple of questions about valuation and they can relate to what you're doing in your in your evaluation here's the first one so when you value your company unless you have a very odd valuation you've got to come up with a value different from the price right every those of you have finished evaluation agree with this your value is going to be different from the price some of you it's lower some of you it's going to be higher so I'm going to read a few statements about how you would characterize this and you're going to give away a lot more than you intend to by which which answer you pick the first is that you are right and the market is wrong how many of you think that that is the best explanation good because that was the case you got an ego problem that's so big that I don't even know where to start right how about you are wrong and the market is right be honest many of you are starting with that perception right and you know how this is going to manifest itself which is you tweak numbers you push up your growth rate you lower your discount rate you play a little with this and the value moves closer and you feel so much more comfortable don't take it as personally this is how it is when you first start to do evaluation it's safe for us to be close to the market because then if you screw up you always have lots of comfort the truth though is that you're both wrong why because the market is I mean think of it as a Yelp review of a restaurant versus your own review of a restaurant the preview is not perfect I've got to restaurants with five star reviews and said who ate at this restaurant this is the crappiest food I've ever eaten you can't account for people's days same thing is true for markets markets make mistakes you make mistakes you're saying what the heck do we do with this you said to hope that your mistake is smaller than the Market's mistake you're both wrong you just hope you're less wrong obviously you both can't be right two numbers can't coexist and claim to be the value at the same time and maybe it's none of the above in which case I'm I'm completely befuddled as to what exactly none of the above would even mean so the reality is you're both wrong and today we're going to talk about what that means what does it mean when you're wrong and you're okay being wrong second now some of you are valuing young companies anybody want to be a volunteer Helmet or who's Valium young companies here one in five you're wearing a young company in fact your wedding was such a young company doesn't even have revenues it takes a lot of courage to pick a company like that right so what do your cash flows look like even in your most optimistic scenarios next year two years out three years that's a you know optimistic scenario zero and the most realistic scenarios they're going to be big negative numbers because they come in fact for most of your value on companies your cash flows are negative in your one year two year three Etc right so what let's say you have negative cash flows of a minus a billion in year One what do you implicit implicitly assuming your company is going to be able to do in your one because remember you have your one year two year three and you get Nirvana which is what the terminal value to get to Nirvana what are you assuming your company would be able to do in year one with the negative cash flow of a minor spending what do you think it's good you have no clue minus a billion negative free cash flow just a number on the spreadsheet but there has to be an implicit assumption you're making no no but first you've got to get over the minus a building that minus is scary you got to come up with fresh Capital India one to cover the minus a building you're implicitly assuming they're going to be able to raise that Capital have you told me from where did you cost a capital you give me weights for debt and Equity so you said 90 Equity 10 percent that you think ninety percent that billion has to come from issuing new shares 10 might be from debt just think so what you raise 900 million new shares what's going to happen to your share card next year it's going to go up and then if you have negative cash flows and your truth it's going to go up more and here's the puzzle when I do the value be uncomfortable if you look at my spreadsheet I take your cash flows I discount them back I come up with the value of equity today and would you divide that value by Equity by the number of shares outstanding today this seems like I'm missing something right because if this company has to issue new shares in the future the share count is going to go up so why am I not counting the extra shares in the share count today knowing because I know I can see in your cash flows you have to issue new shares it seems like I'm being deliberately blind to those share issuances anybody want to give a shot at why I'm not counting those additional shares parameters screwing up that could always be a possibility why am I not counting the extra shares what do this negative cash flow do to your value of equity today see let's say of negative cash flows near one year two year three year four when you take the present value of those cash flows you lower the value of your Equity today by 2 billion two and a half billion three billion right you're effectively already that's a dilution effect you're already counting it in the value if I divide that number by a share count that includes the shares I will issue to cover those negative cash flows I'm actually double Counting lower present value because of negative cash flows higher share count for the same reason I'm double counting I'm going to undervalue the company it makes my life a lot simpler to do what I'm doing which is to ignore the share issuances and count the effect of the delusion in the present value no it sounds abstract but when I do my Amazon valuation I'll actually quantify how much of that dilution effect already is in my value and why I don't need to count the extra shares so with that lead and let's go back to the Amazon page which is where we left off last session I think we're page 286. they remember my valuation of Amazon I you know I dug the company out of the ground small money losing company I made it a big money making company I allowed for the growth by putting in a reinvestment based in a sales to Capital ratio but I didn't quite complete the entire process so if you project out what my revenues are going to be I'd use the compounded Revenue growth of 42 to make my revenues go from a billion to 41 billion today I'll talk about why I use 42 as my growth rate and why 41 billion as my hand revenues I made the losses become profits and I'll talk about how I'm getting the margin to be intermediate years but I start with minus 36.7 I end up at plus 10. and for the reinvestment I use the sales to Capital ratio and this is actually the first valuation where I concocted concocted a sales to Capital ratio and it was after struggling with every other approach I'd ever been taught in estimating reinvestment take a look at my free cash flows and this is an upbeat story of a company that's going to increase revenues 44 to improve its margins if you look at my free cash for the firm minus 931 million India one minus 1 billion in year two minus 989 million year three in fact my cash flows to the first six years are all negative which means implicitly I'm assuming that Amazon would raise Capital primarily from Equity because I'm using but 99 Equity one percent debt for the next six years I got my cash flows what do I need to complete the valuation I need costs of capital notice the word I I used to the word plural because car one there can't be one cause to happen because the company is changing too much over the next 10 years I start with the cost to Capital of twelve point eight four percent when Amazon is a Young Money losing company but as you go through time take a look at what's happening with my cost of capital as the company becomes larger and more money making the cost of capital decreases to 9.61 that's what you should expect to see with young companies cost of capital starting High going to much lower now I'm almost home I'd have to take the cash flows and discount them back at the cost of capital so I'm going to do something incredibly simplistic but hang in there anyway right so I take your one discount back one year you're two discount back two years now normally the way you discount is you take the cash flow and divide by one plus the discount rate raised to the r567 don't do that when your cost of capital are changing you got to keep track of what's called accumulated cost account and let me explain if you take your seventh cash flow which I think is 177 million you can't discount it back seven years at 11.62 percent you got to take one point one two eight four and take the product of those costs of capital because your cost of capital are changing over time we take those present values and the elephant in the room of course is the terminal value of 52 billion what you get is the present value is 15.17 billion you add cash almost nothing subtract that almost nothing you get a value for Equity of 14.8 percent ready to divide by the number of shares right but before you do it you have to stop and make sure those options you've been giving away I haven't eaten away too much to go back if during the option section you wanted why are we wasting our time how much difference can it make take a look at how much of Amazon's Equity has been given away in the previous five or six years as options to employees 2.9 billion dollars there's almost 20 percent of the value has been given away why because accountants keep kept telling them it's free doesn't matter and they took that too hard gave away with the company you divide by the number of shares outstanding the value per share again is thirty five dollars and eight cents forget the eight cents 35 dollars is this an upbeat story that I'm telling revenues go from a billion to 41 billion margins go from a big negative number to a big positive number they're reinvesting incredibly efficiently and in spite of telling the upbeat Story the value that I'm getting is only 35 as opposed to what the stock was actually trading at 84. look at the start of this class I said the whole point of valuing companies is you need to be willing to act on those valuations I've tried my best to stay true to that I mean half maybe two-thirds of my portfolio is composed to companies I've been trapped in Dubai in what way I value a company the value is higher than the price somebody in the audience says would you buy the stock I can say no in which case I've lost that person for the rest of the session because if you can not go to buy the stock what's the point I can say no and lie you have no way of checking oh yes and buy yeah and I get trapped up by so if something is undervalued I'm fairly willing to jump in and buy that stock here I've come up with a company that is over that obviously you're not asking me am I bi what's the analogous question you would ask me here am I shorting it's exactly the question I got asked at the end of this valuation and they said not in this lifetime the natural response I got is don't you feel confident enough in your value to do it I said I'm feeling more confident that Amazon is overvalued in January 2000 then I felt about any company that I bought that was under that was not a conference issue so here's my generic question why when something is undervalued am I willing to step in and buy but when something is overvalued I'm not as eager at least in January 2000 to step in and sell short what's the difference what do you need to make money remind me again after you bought this what has to happen the price has to adjust to that when I buy something I control my timer right you know I control my time Horizon I'm not a portfolio manager I don't have clients to answer to I have my spouse to answer to but I turned off statements to paperless a long time ago she doesn't even know what's in her portfolio I'm willing to wait as long as it takes and I can win whereas when you sell short what exactly are you doing can anybody tell me what what's selling short reports no points you're borrowing the shares and agreeing to return them if you're asked for those shares back so I knew this question was coming you could see it coming by the way so before I did the session I called her out to see how long a broker would give me on a short set before they would ask for the shares back peak of the.com book the demand for the shares was incredibly High the longest I could get and this was from a broker who really liked me for six weeks he said I could give you six weeks but that's because you're a good customer now do you see why I said not in my lifetime not only do I have to feel confident that I've got the value right but I have to feel confident that the adjustment will happen in the next six weeks and that's one of the great asymmetries in investing when something is undervalued there is a Bargain Basement strategy it's Buy and Hold when something is overvalued it's difficult to find an equivalent long-term strategy that you can use to take advantage of the Rope evaluation you know what the implication of this is right you're not going to get too many downside bubbles you're going to get a lot more upside bubbles because you have an upside bubble all you can do is look and wonder and say that's really overpressed remember the peak of the housing bubble sell shorty neighbor's house I sold your house it's not my house but I'll return it to you in 30 years it doesn't work that way so the problem with bubbles when you cannot have a strategy to sell short is Bubbles are going to get bigger eventually they'll all burst but you can't take advantage of them as quickly which allows them to get as big as they do so I want to talk about this valuation but I want you to remember that because many of you will find your companies to be overvalued and I'm going to ask you to buy or sell but selling short requires not it's just not it's not a question of confidence being able to get enough of a Time horizon or even if you're right you're able to make money so let's look at some of the lessons you can extract from this valuation remember when you talked about betas I said don't trust betas lots of standard error the backward looking that goes in Spades when you look at the beta for a young company in January 2000 Amazon was a young company I pulled up the Bloomberg beta page and you can if you want you can compare the beta page then to the beta page now there was the regression beta 2.23 you're saying this is good I have a regression beta take a look at the second to last item in that box the standard error of the beta 0.50 so let me put this up the regression rate is 2.2 the standard error is 0.5 see the range you're going to get on the bay that's somewhere between 1.2 and 3.2 fat lot of good that does you unveiling Amazon with young companies regression beta has become incredibly noise so even if you are attached using regression rate is for mature companies don't do it for young couples think what's the choice what do we do as a counter to regression leaders we said estimate a bottom-up beta and for Amazon I'm sure for Amazon in 2000 I estimated two bottom-up agents for the first five years I used the beta for online retailers as my beta for the company why because young online retail company money losing company I said that's probably better reflective of where they are as a company once you get to year five well I'm giving this company 15 billion dollars in Revenge so large retail company so starting in year five I moved that beta towards a beta for all retail companies that's why you saw my cost of equity shift as much as it did but again you're sticking with bottom-up betas rather than going with the regression beta second I'm going to give away the secret sauce you know what the what Chef said don't come into the kitchen you want to see how I'm making the meal I'm going to take you into the kitchen so you can see where the 42 compounded Revenue growth comes from so there's no mystery here when I first sat down to Value Amazon I did it the way I would start to do valuation which is to go sequence you know what that means to your one then do your two then do you and I discovered very quickly it was driving me crazy too much uncertainty I had no idea what year two would look like your three would look like by the time I got to year four I was completely lost I said this isn't working so I tried a different game and it's a game that I still go back to whenever I look at young companies I said rather than try to estimate what year one and year two and year three will bring I'm going to think of what a successful Amazon will look like to me that's a storybook and in 2000 I actually liked Amazon as a company like the way it was run I like the way Jeff Bezos had said are the Strategic direction for the company I thought would succeed but I had no idea what success would look like so here's what I did I downloaded data in every retail company because I wanted to get a sense of what does big Revenue look like for a retail company the largest retail company in 2000 was Walmart with 180 billion in directors the first question asked was if Amazon succeeds will it look like Walmart and in 2000 my answer is I don't think so it's not a discount retailer it wants a better margin so I said it's not going to be 180 but I looked at the gap which had 18 billion in Revenue so it said Amazon succeeds would look like the Gap and I said it's going to be bigger than the Gap it's not just repair itself other stuff because by 2000 it had already made this transition from online book retailer to online retailer pretty much everything almost by trial and error going back and forth I ended up around the sixth largest retail it was Amazon succeeds it's going to be about as big as the sixth largest retailer and guess how much revenue the six largest retailer in the world had about 40 billion dollars so I'm know where I am I know where I'd like to get and they say how do you come up with those Revenue growth rates in year one two three I made the month you didn't receive me I made them up and if you made a really big deal about your one you say you know what I think the revenue growth rate is going to be 163.33 you can have it you want here to take it too if you give me the final number the end number I control the valuation you know when you get the fcff ginzu spreadsheet I ask you for a revenue growth rate the growth rate is not the end game it's what you get as revenues into your 10 that you should keep your eye on it that that's driving the valuation so you can play with the growth rate and you're one and yours two through five but keep your eyes on the price which is what will the revenues look like as a mature company because that's where your story is that's why when young companies report their first earnings reports and people free card earnings per share is two cents worse than expected I mean the analogy I can think of is when you have a kid and the kid goes off to kindergarten comes back with the kindergarten report card you look at the report go and say you're never going to college you may be overreacting don't you think what did you see in that report card no but that's basically how when people early earnings reports you feel like what are you reacting to It's The End Game that drives the valuation focus on the long term so that's the revenue part so any questions on so that's why the 42 came from it's from trying to get to 400 billion I'm sorry to 40 billion in revenues that gives you about a 42 percent in fact let me pause that could I have told a bigger story for Amazon in 2000 yes you could have said well Amazon would be more like Walmart and then what I would expect to see then is margins that are much lower to go with that because you're telling a discount retail story so I'm not saying my story is right but it's my story it's going to drive my valuation you could think of alternate stories which lead you to different ending yes the Only Rule I followed as I said I made it up is As I got bigger I used to lower growth so if you want to build in some mathematical function I'll tell you to have very little effect on your final value that's why it's not worth finessing the only rule is as you scale up it's going to be more and more difficult to get high growth rate so make the growth rate decrease as you get bigger because delivering the same increase in revenues in year three will give you a lower growth rate than delivering it in year two You're Building off lower base right now let's talk about margins I know my starting margin right it's given minus 36.7 I know my ending march how the heck did you come up with all these middle numbers looks like I'm incredibly prescient right second decimal point minus 13.35 percent you might think I have some crystal ball in my basement say please tell me what am I I'll give away a secret what I had in my spreadsheet initially was 10 empty cells and complete Terror on having to fill in those shelves trying to estimate margins here so I turned my spreadsheet loose and say please fill in the numbers and it was actually very compliant but I had to give it some Direction I gave it a very simple algorithm that actually filled out the cells and I want you to try to guess what that algorithm was okay what is it that's allowing me to go from -36 to minus 13.35 minus 37. I'll give you a clue it's got nothing to do with exponentials logs don't think high level math think third grade math how do you think I've come up with those numbers anybody want to try to figure them out I'll give you a starting point where am I now minus 36.7 where would I like to be at the end ten what's the distance between those two points I took half the distance off the distance brings me to minus 13.35 I'm now at minus 13.35 I want to get to plus 10. I take half the distance that brings me to one points minus one point saying why half why not I'll tell you when I build spreadsheets I want to design them in a way where if you disagree with my story you can go and change the numbers quickly you know what the half does it moves me towards my margin pretty quickly it's a pathway to profitability let's say you agree with every other part of my Amazon valuation but you think the pathway to profitability is going to be a lot more Rocky for Amazon than I think it is you know what you can do take the hab and make it a quarter so ask an input if I do that what happens I move a quarter of the distance each year I'm going to lose more money for a longer period before I turn the corner you know this input I've replaced in the spreadsheet because people got puzzled by it remember the converged year of convergence input I ask you for you know what that's designed to do right if you are optimistic about your company being able to it's move to its margin smoothly you set a year of convergence that's sooner you're going to get to your target margin in year four or five I'm going to move you faster if you send it to your 10 you're still going to get to the same Target margin but it's going to take you a lot longer to get there you're going to lose more money before you get there it's the easiest mechanism I could think of for fixing margins so there's the secret it looks precise but it's based on this very simplistic algorithm again if you made a big deal about margins in year one so I think it's going to be minus 15 you can have it you want your to have that tip the end game is what's driving the value which so if you take the revenues multiply them by the margins you come up with expected operating debit then I have after taxes the first three years I'm losing money so my after tax effort is the same as my pre-tax in year four I'm making money but I seem to be paying no taxes what am I doing that's protecting me from having to pay taxes in year four I just keep track of how much money you've lost and if you gave me a starting and well I add that to it and in the years that I start to make money I use your nol to offset taxes the simplest and cleanest way to deal with NOS is to build them into your cash flows in this case I use the no ledo4 I use part of it in year five and in year six I have no nols left I go to your effective tax rate that's why I ask you if you have a money losing company do not give me an effective tax rate I don't care I'm not going to ask you to pay taxes but eventually I will push your tax rate towards what you tell me your tax rate is once you've run out of those Airlines so there's my after tax operating income hopefully this takes the mystery away it looks like there are lots of assumptions but it actually is three assumptions Revenue growth margin and the sales in the next page you're going to see the sales Capital ratio driving your numbers now I've had at least uh half a dozen of you ask me why I stopped in year 10. partly because you're valuing young companies with a lot of promise and you want to go 15 years in 20 years mechanically there's no reason why you can't go right you just extend the spreadsheet out and I could tell you how to do it I could actually do it for you if you need to but before you start adding extra years I'm going to show you a graph that should make you sober up before you start adding years it's a graph that actually looks at IPOs and revenue growth at IPOs relative to the revenue growth of the sectors that these IPOs belong to let me start with the good news when you track IPOs and you look at the revenue growth one year after the IPO the revenue growth is 15 higher than the secretary say this is why I bought the IPO they're much faster growing you track the same IPOs two years after that Revenue growth is about seven percent higher than the sector three years after it's three percent higher than sex by the time you get to year five you cannot tell the star company apart from the set you know the lesson from this graph is growth Fades fairly quickly at most companies the median growth period for a Growth Company the US is between three to five years the 90th percentile of growth periods for growth companies is about 10 years I've stopped there are there companies that have grown for longer than 10 years absolutely you can name them right Apple Microsoft what is the fact that we can name these companies tell you about these companies they're the exception not the rule and I think when we talked about terminal value I said be careful because if you make your company an exceptional company right off the bat where's your upsell you priced it to me the very best so I stop at 10 years not because I don't know that companies can grow for longer than 10 years but because I feel from an intrinsic value standpoint that if you continue to grow after 10 years it should be icing on the cake for me not the cake itself because it's something I need to claim as an investor let's talk about reinvestment I've given you the mechanics of reinvestment and you're using it in the spreadsheet the sales and capital ratio and it's good right because you connect reinvestment revenues you got to move on so what I've done here is taken the revenues taking the change in revenues every year and used to sales to Capital ratio to get my reinvestment so you take the change whatever it is 1.676 billion you divide by three you get 559 million do that every year two things to say about those mechanics one is your sales and capital ratio doesn't have to be constant over time in fact I give you a shot in the spreadsheet to change it after year five if you feel that your company will become more efficient or less efficient in delivering goals second that reinvestment you have also becomes the change in invested Capital each year this is always true in free cash flow evaluation is whatever you show us reinvestment becomes the delta in your invested Capital you're saying so what if you look at the bottom three lines of your evaluation output from your spreadsheet here's what I do I keep track of your after tax operating income based on your growth and margins I also keep track of what's happening to your invested Capital over time using your reinvestment numbers added on to your starting reinvestment number this is going somewhere hang in there with me if I divide the after tax operating by the investment capital I come up with a return and invested Capital you never used it directly in your evaluation but when you made assumptions about sales to Capital and growth and margins whether you like it or not you are creating a return on Capital and here's what I'd like you to do take a look at your return on Capital in your your debt and don't look at your return Capital now it's a negative number it's a young Growth Company it's losing money take a look at it near debt I'll tell you what I did with Amazon the return on Capital I got in your 10 was 20.39 and I was okay with that why was I okay with it remember this was in 2000 the t-bond rate was six and a half percent very different time the average return on capital for retail companies was about 17 percent and after that Amazon was special enough that it could earn a higher return capital what if this would be 200.39 instead of 20 43 hours that would have been a number that I could not live with too high a number if you return in capital in your 10 is too high what is it telling you about how much you reinvested during the next 10 days you didn't really invest enough right and if you're listening what should you do go back and lower your sales to Capital ratio to get a return on Capital you can live with you're building a company with your assumptions and you got to be okay with the company you've built and one of the triggers you're going to look at is what kind of return on Capital am I giving this company to your tent based on my assumptions so if you get a chance go back and look at that return on Capital get into your 10 for your company and ask yourself am I okay with that returning capital they talked about dilution let me go back and fill in the gaps when you have young companies money losing companies cash burning companies companies negative free cash flows it is true that to cover those cash flows you have to raise Capital some of that capital is going to come from issuing Equity there's going to be a dilution effect and you worry about why am I not counting the delusion you take the Amazon valuation you go back and show you the cash flows you take those cash flows the value I got was 15.17 billion right but remember that already incorporates the negative cash flows to the first six years if I hadn't counted those negative cash flows this number would have been eight would have been about 18.2 bit in effect I'm lowering the value of Amazon by about 16 percent why because the company has negative cash flows that's a dilution effect I'm already breaking it into value and because I'm already lowering the value by 16 for those negative cash flows I'd be double counting if I then brought in the additional shares I'd be issued to cover those negative cash flows into the denominator yes then you don't have then then the cash flows are positive and in fact that's a good question yes when you have positive free cash flows prefer and you discount them what are you effectively assuming the company is going to be doing each year what's a discounting deal it's taking the cash out of the company right there's no cash built up in the company because in a discounted cash flow evaluation everything gets extracted out of the company either as cash flows to debt interest and principal payments or cash flows to equity so positive free cash flows are easy to deal with the cash leaving the company negative cash flows are more difficult because that has to be Capital coming into the company and that can alter share but in the case of BuyBacks the Share account can actually decrease and there again you don't want to count that because that'd be double count you'd be counting the cash flows and lowering the share count at the same time so when you do discounted cash flow evaluation don't worry about share cut or changes in check out over time the Press value should already take care of it when I valued Amazon in 2000 I make a confession those negative cash flows in year six I assume that the company would be able to raise the capital to keep going is that a safe assumption though and what no in the aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank collapsing you've got stories about how this might impact Venture Capital to young company let's say a young company in Silicon Valley lots of promise but big negative cash flows for the next three years but let's suppose Venture Capital rise up what's going to happen God near one you can't raise the capital what happened to company even if every single forecast is right the company is going to fail right it's going to be sold liquidated and in 2001 that's exactly what happened to.com companies in 2000 I did not have a failure rate in my spreadsheet and it was a mistake it was a mistake because I was missing the fact that young companies can fit 2001 I learned my lesson that's when failure rates first showed up in my spreadsheets because I said if a company's unable to raise the cash flows it is likely to fail the problem with the failure rate is if you ask me how can I best estimate the failure rate my answer is going to be kind of fuzzy if your company has a rating then I'm going to say use the rating because we have a history of ratings of what percentage of companies with each trading fair so you go to the failure rate worksheet in your spreadsheet and there is a worksheet you'll actually see given the rating what the likelihood of failure is by your debt so that's one but many young companies don't have ratings so here are a couple of things that you want to factor in this is actually from the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US and this is actually one of the most interesting data sets that I discovered they maintain this every year it's pre go to the Bureau of Labor statistic you can download it here's what they do they track the number of companies that are starting up in each business and they track what percentage of these companies make a 301 make it three or two make it three or three let's look at the from this graph what that that statistic this one the 2007 starting the next page I'll give you the update in 2007 for every 100 companies that got started eighty percent made it through your what twenty percent failed in Year One look at period two like 66 so from your point here to another 14 failure each year the failure rate is getting lower but by the time you get to your 10 for every 100 companies that got started about 31. made it to yourself what do we assuming that the CDC evaluation cash flows you know one year two year three year four year five you're ten right if you have a young company already you can see that if I took those cash flows discounted the back and came up with the value I'm getting the value for the 31 percent of the time the company will make it but the remaining 69 what happens the company fails and then I've got to follow through what happens in a company fails it sells the tests so if you look at right below the failure rate I ask you what happens if you fail what percentage of value you're going to get back you're not going to get 100 back you're going to get 50 back 30 back 20 back or nothing back and I incorporate that into your value of equity by saying 30 of the time the company's worth ten dollars the remaining seventy percent of the time I'll get back only three dollars my expected value there is 30 times 10 plus 70 percent times three so it's decision trees and statistics I'm bringing in the likelihood of failure into the bad most of your companies because of public companies are not at the 70 failure rate thank God for that because if you put a 70 failure rate you're going to knock off a big chunk of your bed you'll probably look at 15 20 25 failure rates but that should be incorporated the event and it's not just young companies I mean somebody's valuing Boeing as I was walking who's selling boy I ran into them in the elevator there you go now in 2020 there was talked March of 2020 there was a talk that Boeing would not make it why it's a company significant debt and it's one lawsuit away or one more accident away from God knows what I would take that with the boy you got to factor in a likelihood of failure and there you have an advantage you have a rating you can use the rating to make that judgment but I think it gives you more realistic estimates of value for competence if you bring that failure rated see what do VCS do about this they make up these Target rates right 50 60 70 hoping that it somehow incorporates failure rates it's like a bludgeon you're going to do this right you have to separate out operating risk from failures that's what we're trying to do and here's the update and if you go if you go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics you can get the 2021 update I think they don't have the 2022 numbers so they do this every year you can keep track of what percentage of companies make it through your debt your six year seven and you can see that some SEC information which is that the name for technology for every 100 companies that gets started up if you track them over time only by 12 companies make it through your debt a huge amount of failure especially in the first 10 years now I'm going to tell you something that should make you feel a lot better okay when you value companies any companies but especially with young companies you're going to come with a value you're going to look and say how do I know I'm right I'll save you the trouble you're wrong you're definitely wrong you're probably hopelessly wrong you're wrong 100 of the time and it's okay you say how can it be okay you don't have to be right to make money you just have to be less wrong than everybody else right that's the thing you got to remind yourself of this is not about being right it's about being less wrong and on companies which are young companies so there's a lot of uncertainty your chances of being less wrong than everybody else are actually greater than with mature companies because there's far more stuff that people don't dig into because they give up so be glad that people give up on value young companies because it's our opening to hey I'm going to Value young companies and potentially walk away with an advantage because most people are not even trying so I get to the end of my my Amazon webcast my value is 35 the stock price is 84. and somebody in the audience asked me the question maybe it's in here somewhere I would like that somebody asked me is it possible that Amazon is worth eighty four dollars per share my answer was if possible is such a weak but of course it's possible and I find this useful when I value companies you might or might not but I create a break even chart remember the three big assumptions here are Revenue growth margins and sales capital and revenue growth and margins are in fact the bigger assumptions I create a table where I put Revenue growth on one axis margins in the office of Revenue growth on the left axis the vertical axis margins of the horizontal axis my base case was about 32 percent growth and 10 margins but I vary that number what am I looking for I'm looking for values that exceed 84 dollars per share see the yellow shaded boxes so this company or the the case of Amazon 2000 if they could grow it 50 a year and have 14 margins they'll be worth more than 84. if they could go at 55 percent a year and have 10 margin of worth 80 86 and if they could grow at 60 percent a year and of eight percent margins so is it possible that Amazon's worth 84. absolutely but investing in the game of odds and I think if you go in with that expectation the odds of you making money drop off because too much has to happen right for you to just break even so now that we talk about follow-up so I finished my 2000 valuation I found the company to be massively out of that right I said I didn't sell short and I gave you the little song and dance about why one year later aimr the paired organization the CFO for whom I did the first webcast came back and said would you be willing to do a second webcast on.com companies but this time the webcast is going to be will any.com company ever be worth money again because remember between 2000 and 2001 the.com boom bust and people are saying no none of these companies is worth every month so I said okay so in 2001 I revalued Amazon and it was a very eventful year you had the economy going to recession the.com boom it bust you know worries about Capital being raised at increased so my value went from 35 down to about twenty dollars per share and remember I finished the valuation and somebody in the audience said aren't you uncomfortable that you value change by this much in one year and I said after a year like last year I'd be uncomfortable if my value did not change at least this much and if you think I've changed my mind going from 35 to 20 how do you characterize what the market did because in that intervening period the price went from 84.11 per share the stock went from being dramatically overvalued to significantly undervalued and I was trapped you know why right because this got the question I was asked was are you buying and now I couldn't do the song and dance about time Horizon I bought Amazon for the first time at the end at the start of 2001. how long did I hold I've been told especially old-time value investors what's the rule Buy and Hold for the rest I never understood that how can that be consistent with the value investing philosophy because you buy when something is undervalued what should you sell but it's over that which is what because it means that once you buy something you got to re because you can't stay with the original valuation so in 2002 I revalued the company my value Act was a good year my value went up to you know to about 30 dollars and the stock price went up as well but it was still undervalued it stayed in my portfolio 2003 the value went up significantly but the price almost tripled it was time for me to leave so I left I bought Amazon four times in the last 21 years I've sold Amazon three dots in the last 21 years which should try to tell you where I am with Amazon right now okay I bought Amazon for the most recent most recently six months ago but my point is when you value something and you find it over value don't give up on it you've done the hard work you've built up evaluation for the company Revisited maintenance valuations actually take about 20 minutes every year basically you update the numbers you revisit your story the price is going to change your stock can go from being overvalued to undervalued over the course of a year so Never Say Never I've heard investors say I would never buy snowflake I would never buy Amazon because at the right price you should be willing to buy if you truly believe in valuation finally I did something that I usually don't do because it depresses me I took my forecasts from 2000. so this was in 2014 and compared them to the actual numbers that Amazon delivered so there's my forecast there are my actual numbers let's stop at 2010 which is my I'd forecast revenues of 41 billion they actually came in lower body of extended they grew for longer than I thought they would so my Revenue growth I clearly underestimated how much they could grow there are my margins they're the actual modules they aren't the short of my margins whatever I learned about Amazon I I'm I've often called Amazon my Field of Dreams company and if you see in the movie Field of Dreams Kevin Costner if you haven't you know Kevin Costner builds a baseball field in the middle of nowhere it's one of the eye States it must be an Iowa City no no there's a baseball field in the middle of cornfields so he's built the field and this farmer who lives for 10 10 miles down the road comes over and says what are you doing building a baseball field in the middle of nowhere one of the most famous lines of movie Dem what does Kevin Costner say you remember if we build it they will come that's the Amazon essentially it captures how Amazon thinks about business if we build it revenues they will come the profits will come in a sense you could see this with Amazon they went for Revenue growth at the expense of margins it's a perfectly viable strategy but it's a lesson I learned so I valued Amazon in 2012. I've factored that lesson and this is a company that can that has patience built into its DNA and essentially we'll keep doing this and the other thing I changed was I thought of Amazon as a retail company I thought that's where they would end up and they would peek off at about 60 70 billion revenues but somewhere in 2010 and 2011 there was almost a rethink of Amazon and what they were as a company in fact in 2012 and I'd revalued Amazon I called them A disruption platform because that's the way I think about Amazon they're a company that targets any business that they think has fattened and goes after it in fact one of the most telling indications of how much Amazon gets into the minds of other companies because I remember survey done of CEOs of the 50 largest companies in the world they were asked to list out five companies that they viewed as potential competitors so let's start with Walmart do you think Amazon lives in Walmart set I don't think there's a single decision that Walmart makes that doesn't factor in what Amazon would do so do you think FedEx thinks about Amazon the largest logistics company but there were some surprises JP Morgan Chase was asked list five potential competitors and you know who came up on the list of top five Amazon and there's a reason for that right because every disruption platform needs an army and what's the army that Amazon has built up over the last 20 years all right members right the day they bought Whole Foods I got an email from Amazon saying would you be interested in frozen meals being delivered to you and given I mean I don't know about you but you know if I want something delivered two days from now it's Amazon or nothing there's nobody else I would trust in the world and I don't like my Bankers I have my account at JPMorgan Chase and they pissed me off to know it I remember when I moved from the east coast to the West Coast I moved from a JPMorgan Chase branch here to a JPMorgan Chase branch there and they charged me 45 and said what the heck did you do take my money convert the cash put in the back of a mule and set it across I mean why 45 because they can you know what should terrify JPMorgan Chase that tomorrow Amazon sends me an email saying we're starting Amazon bank would you be interested I'll be there in a second okay so when you think about what Amazon has become it's become a disruption platform so my story for Amazon has shifted over time because the company's different it's changed over time so if you're if you're interested my most recent valuation I think was a year ago February 2022. you can take a look at that valuation compared to my 2000 valuation it is going to look really different but it should because it reflects the changes in the company so there is my disruptive platform valuation this was uh I don't know what when I did this probably in September of 2000 and date should be up there but you can see that this is Amazon valued As A disruption platform and the advantage Being A disruption platform is what's your potential Market it could be in any business you want it can be immense and that gets factored into the valuation my advice for you is when you tell a story for a company try to visualize what that story translates into with Amazon disruption platform you know when I think about Amazon who comes to mind Thanos from The Avengers right because if you're in a business and if Amazon enters your business that's like you know time there's the thick of the fingers that you turn to to dust when I think of Netflix I think of a hamster on a wheel why because if you think about that business you're producing 100 new shows every day to keep you kind of occupied and that never ends so try to visualize it because it'll give you a story more meaning and you can then think about what will this mean in terms of growth and margins and reinvestment as you go along so we've talked about young growth companies and the challenge is learning younger you're saying what about mature companies normally mature companies are easy to Value because they have a long history and they keep doing what they're doing but once in a while a mature company stops and says maybe we need to change the way we do things often because they get somebody from the outside pushing a car like and a Bill Ackman saying you need to be different so let's assume you have a mature company that is in transition that's changing the way it's doing business because the old ways are not working and let's think about the challenges in valuing a company like them so when you look at the existing numbers you have a long history but you know those numbers will look different if the company changes its business more so here's how it'll look when you look at each Quest when I ask you what are your cash flows from existing assets you can give me your history but you're going to say but that could change if we change our business I'm going to ask you what's the value of growth again you can give me history and say but that could change if we change the way we run the company with every question you're going to get two different answers one with the status quo and one of the companies run different if you try to bring them into the same valuation it's going to drive you crazy so here's my advice value the company twice once for the status for the existing business model and once with what you see as the new business model you're going to get two different values then you got to estimate a likelihood that the company will actually change that expected value is then going to become the value of the company so rather than deal in abstractions let me give you the example of a mature company which is potentially going to change you've got Hormel Foods never heard of it it makes beans but you know what it's most famous product is an audience disgusting product called spam spam is like ham that can last forever think about that for a moment a meat that lasts forever what you need to add to it was concocted by formal Foods in the 1940s when the US Army was trying to get people back from Asia back to the US after the World War II the problem is too long to fly so what happened was that all these soldiers loaded up from the Far East coming to the US and they stopped in Hawaii and Hawaii then it's not like Hawaii today no five-star hotels there wasn't enough food to feel hundreds of thousands of hungry soldiers you can say ask me coconuts wouldn't work they needed meat they were not vegans so the U.S army put out a requisition of any company can figure out a way to take meat and can it and Make It Last Forever we'll buy it hence was born spam this is why if you go to Hawaii still you get cookbooks built around spam you can make anything with a kimchi spam you know Kung Pao chicken becomes Kung Pao spam you throw spam whatever it is you replace with Spam so Hormel Foods has been around a long time and it's a company which actually is very conserved with rents Pennsylvania based it's a family control it used to be a family control company now it's run by the traditional managers and it's very conservative of many friends it doesn't borrow very much money why because the family never like to borrow money the company refused to borrow money so the existing debt ratio reflects that reflects that fact I think their that rate existing debt ratio is about 10 90 Equity even though they could afford to borrow money they don't like to reinvest much why because they don't like to grow outside the US they thought of the us as their Market they said we don't care about foreign sales anyway so conservative run company doesn't reinvest much doesn't use much debt so my initial evaluation reflects that reality because they don't reinvest much that growth rate is low 2.75 because they don't use much debt that cost it capital stays higher than it should be the value per share that I got for Hormel so it's run by the existing management this is about 32 dollars per share and I'd have stopped there if that's what was I expected to happen the long term but Hormel Foods have been targeted by a couple of activists investors who are pushing it to be more aggressive on two fronts one is they felt that the company could actually grow faster if it reinvested more the higher reinvestment rate the second is they felt the company could afford to borrow more money so I increased the debt ratio to 40 I'll talk about why is the 40 and I increase the reinvestment rate from you know from 19 down up to 40 which increases the growth rate now there was there to give up some returns lower return projects still higher than the cost of capital so they're going to grow faster and have a lower cost of capital that translates the value 38 dollars per share so value per share is 32 dollars the existing management runs I'm 38 dollars if they can change the way there are as an investor I have to decide which one I want to invest in and I don't know which one's going to play out so I wanted to attach a probability that change will come so what what are you going to what are some of the things you're going to look at to see if a company would change you're going to look at the shareholder base see who's to shareholder in the company are they making a call icon on the list it likely would have changed goes up the largest single shareholder in the in Hormel was this home was a foundation called the Hormel Foundation the family had set up a foundation for the shares it owned about 26 of the shares they took a look at the Hormel Foundation maybe they'll be my ally in changing the company you know who headed the Hormel Foundation the CEO of formality this kind of reduces the chance of success here so the chance I attached to change was about 10 percent it's not zero because Hershey's had the same structure and change came there 90 chance that they will not change in my expected value is just 90 of 32 dollars plus 10 of 38 32.50 we'll come back to this issue later when we talk about acquisition for the value of control but essentially when you have companies changing you have to factor in what the effect of that change will be let me talk a little bit about a couple of issues here especially on the debt ratio I don't know how strong your corporate finance class was in what happens to your costly Capital when you change debt ratios but I'm going to give you a very quick review of how to compute the optimal debt ratio for a company so what do you have here are the existing debt ratio for the company 10.39 I want to find out what the right mix of debt and equities for the company and remember my objective is to minimize my cost of capital I want to get the lowest cost of capital again so I changed that ratio from zero to ninety percent I'm trying to factor in what will happen to my cost of equity and my cost of debt as I go from zero to ninety percent my Beta goes up somebody remind me again why is my Beta going up am I coming up with these betas at the higher debtorations on level re-level that's why we did the mechanism of unlevering and re-levering and the beta will go up because of 11 Bay so my cost of equity goes up to get my cost of debt I estimated a rating for the company in every debt ratio how do you think I did this what did I do you remember the synthetics rating synthetic ratings process where I use the interest coverage ratio to come up with the rating that's basically what I did I computed the interest coverage ratio to each debt ratio and as I borrow more money guess what happened the interest coverage ratio it gets smaller because I have more interest expenses my rate decreases as my rating decreases I come up with the cost of debt at each debt ratio because remember we get a default spread free Trading there's my cost of debt you adjust for the tax benefit and at the very high debt ratios I start losing tax benefit because I don't have enough income to cover the interest expense there's my cost of capital this is the right way to figure out what your right debt ratios you can't just keep the cost of equity in cost of that fix and just change the weights that doesn't work you've got to change both the net effect here is my optimal debt ratios where my cost is between 30 and 40 percent that's where I put Hormel is between 30 and 40 percent so when you look at a company and you can take your company and you see an existing debt ratio that's their existing debt ratio you can always ask the question what is the optimal debt ratio for my company and figure out what that mix is and to check to see how much your value they hire if in fact you move to the office any questions on mature companies because some of you are value mature companies I mean for the moment don't do anything crazy just value the company as is with the status quo but leave open that question of what will the value of my company be if somebody else ran the company there are changes that came to the company which brings me to the final piece of this policy valuing declining companies let's see what's Difficult about valuation with declining companies when I ask you what are your cash flows of existing asks can you give me your historical data I'm going to see some depressing facts right your revenues are probably going to be shrinking your margins are getting compressed because the company is not doing well when you think about the value of growth there's really no value for growth it's really shrinking you had asked how much will my value increase if I shrink in the right places I'm going to ask you how risky are the cash flows depending on what your what's happening to your business and what you're doing to pay down your debt your business could be getting riskier or safer depending on what choices you make every question becomes difficult to answer the same reasons young growth companies it gets different because the company is changing it's shrinking over time so again let me let's talk about how to deal with declining companies and I think the biggest problem is psychological I often when I run into people who value companies all the time I asked them when was the last time you valued a company with negative Revenue growth the answers I've never done but we know company straight so the question is how do you bring that in and you've got to be realistic you got to bring in that drop in revenues you see over time and also bring in the fact that your margins could probably shrink even though you don't want to do it it has to be realistic so as an investor you you have to factor in the expected decline into the cash flows and see what the value of the company is so here is my valuation of JCPenney and I'm going to stop at this page because my allergies are going so crazy I I can't keep going for much longer so if you look at my Revenue growth rate I've got a negative and this is when JCPenney was viewed as a healthy company you see negative growth rate at the top so my revenues are shrinking over time my margins would start low do improve so I assume that they're going to be shutting down their least profitable stores first so think of this as the most upbeat valuation I could think of for JCPenney but it still looks like a Horror Story right shrinking revenues margins leveling off at a low level but over time I am saving this company by making its negative cash flows become positive cash flows it has gone back at the cost of capital and you put in the likelihood that this could all go wrong because if you're shrinking and if you're not paying off debt you could very quickly go into distress 20 chance of failure the value of equity that I get will reflect the fact that I see this company shrinking and I I think somewhere in my website I have a valuation of Bed Bath and Beyond from a couple of months ago okay and there's no happy end to the story this is a Horror Story the question is how will the horror story end and horror stories never end well there's a chainsaw involved probably somewhere in the way and Bed Bath and Beyond that might be the end game so be realistic in forecasting what your company Revenue companies Revenue growth will be and if you have a company where you think Revenue growth is going to be negative don't have any quants about putting a minus five percent growth rate I know some of you are valuing Cruise Lines I know at least a couple of people and one of the issues with Cruise Line companies is will the revenues ever come back when people come back to cruises maybe they will maybe they will not but there is a very realistic chance that you're never going to see 2020 2019 numbers ever again as a cruise line company the good news is you don't have to buy another cruise ship ever again the existing cruise ships are going to be over reinvestment is not going to be an issue the bad news is you can't exactly sell off the cruise ships right who's going to buy these are monstrous thing that you can't fill in maybe you could sell them to somebody once a hot I mean I know there are at least a couple of cities that have used cruise ships to house the homeless it's like an easy way of register getting extra rooms maybe that's the end game if you liquidate you make your company smaller you sell the cruise ships off to anybody who can sell them but if you have a company where the future looks bleak then the best thing to do is be realistic and bring in the declining revenues and the shrinking margins into that business I'm going to stop there I just as I said my my nose is running and I can't wipe my nose because I've had this stupid mic in front of me and I've got to get out of here so I will see you on Wednesday and watch out for the review session for the quiz I will send it right after class today so people coming here yeah it's fine yeah um just email me I can I will email you the quiz it has to be at the same time so email me tomorrow and remind me and I will set it up so that you will get it at 3 30 on Monday so wherever you are make sure you're at some place where you can at least you don't need to so you just have to download the quiz work on it and at 405 and maybe 4 10. email the quiz back okay but not all of them do so it's not so the statistics are based on an average a median firm leading from desktopombatives nothing else because change usually comes to firms and the change is much needed it takes a lot to change management only the very very exceptionally bad firm see management change you don't see it happen at average starts right so generally it's good but there will be cases where people overreach and it doesn't work out it always happens when like the main shareholder is changed or not not necessarily it's not necessarily it just might be a building up of bad feelings in existing shareholders badly said look I'm tired of this and I need children I mean look at Disney wasn't coming from below that you got Bob Iger come back to take over block Chip Pick it came from the fact that you know confident stock usually one of the triggers for a management changes stock prices drop 50 that's one of the things the second easy company for about earnings issue so it'll be a collection of things operating in Market driven that lead to the change but shareholders themselves might be just Vehicles that'll change your stock price drops even shareholders who are happy with you two years ago are no longer happy review so it's not even a changing shareholder base it's a shareholders with different views by the company okay thank you thanks okay entertainment is not even Recreation thank you it'll be everything from growth right we did covered all the way through cash flows yeah growth terminal value and loose ends so it's everything yeah um my question was is not one of the options it's always the questions that get dropped and remember you because it always works forward the final would never work anyway right because it always so it's undressed so much okay so I expected business and the question is are they going to receive the subsidies or their consumers going to receive a substance the consumers but I think also I think in Europe therefore we are just substances companies they have green and green bonds and low cost of debt and access to them so to give them so the two things you can do right one is you can bring in the consumer side if I to give them higher growth because they'll be able to you know sell stuff that people are paying less for because of subsidies on the cost of funding side I would suggest keeping the cost of capital based on what they should be raising Capital ad and doing evaluation and then bringing in the subsidy effect by saying because if subsidies their cost of capital is going to be five percent rather than nine percent that difference of four percent will translate it will increase in subsidized value that's like a 30 increase the reason you want to keep it separate is the government can give subsidies can take them away so you want to make sure you're not building it in perpetuality so if there's a sub it's unlikely to be in the permanent Valley it'll be near one year two or three but by the time you get to your 10 everybody is going to be in green energy you're not going to be subsidized because of that but my company's 10K in Manchester doesn't have the um separation of percentage of revenues for it's different like regions it covers so we like determined that the main ones were in the UK Manchester United is what merchandising and because their their revenues from the team itself has the UK bit right yeah so it's only merchandising gravity then they don't break down much imagine revenues they just use a broader equities but okay cool perfect thank you thanks 
foreign thank you thank you in the digital age and you're using Post-it notes oh okay okay folks welcome back my nose is not running today I feel a lot more confident um a couple of reminders in case you need them first is if you want feedback on your valuation try to get it into me by Friday Friday six seven eight nine even Saturday morning I'll tell you when I need to finish returning because that's all that matters to me what what does it mean for me is I need to return your tcfs back to you before Monday because you know what's going to happen on Monday the crap is going to hit the fan I've got three quizzes and three classes and I got to grade them all so Tuesday I am not looking at a valuation I'm grading quizzes all day so I've left the weekend open deliberately for this reason and then there will be no more open weekends after that so I'll have to hit and run so if you can get it to me by this week and then I can get it back to you by this weekend any question I'm pregnant for your account um Within reasonable limit so if you send it back for the seventh time I might say you know what we've run out of times no but if you have a first one and there are major issues and you want to fix and send back fine no I don't I don't even realize you're sending it back for a second time I'm just hitting and running moving down the rack so if you want to tell me you're sending it back for the second time I'll take a look at what you've changed so if you're doing it for a second time tell me what you change so I can focus on what you've changed and at least get back into that pixels the problem those who receive feedback on the valuation if you're expecting something profound and deep you've been deeply disappointed right I mean that's not what what I can do I don't know everything about every one of your companies since I don't know what you think I know but I don't know that much but I do I don't know the feedback is really about internal consistency in your story it's your story I'm not going to change it I don't want to change it you know why because it's your money that's going to go behind this story not my money so I want you to be comfortable with your story now somebody just before the class said no I have a number that looks weird in my valuation and I'm not picking on the person but when you have a number in your evaluation that looks weird look inward because it's coming from one of your inputs and only really three inputs that drive your numbers forget about the caustic Apple that's really not what the where the Dynamics are to revenue growth to your margin you sell to Capper those are three numbers you give me I didn't put them in there I'm not forcing you to use the industry average so don't use industrial average I don't like this valuation because it's a choice you make so if you feel that a number doesn't sync with what you'd expect to see in the company then by all means go in and change the input that'll change that number okay okay so and that the second of course is your second quiz is next Monday this time there's one extra room but it's KMC 260 which fits uh 170 so I'm gonna put 120 of you in that room I will try to be fair I think it was about eight through H last time was in the other room I don't know what fair for you is whether you'd rather be elsewhere or rather be here but I'm going to try to move a third of the people in each quiz into that room which means the final somebody's going to get a second shot I can't help it so but uh it will be in KMC 260 and I will if you're in that section please go there and the rest of you come here and there will be class after the quest let me re-emphasize there will be class after the quiz you might choose not to come but I will be be here I will deliver the class you can watch it on video If you don't feel like watching it right after the the quiz but there will be class so let's go back and we'll start discussing today we're going to keep doing valuations but there are a couple of small questions that could potentially have big implications that I want to start the classroom the first is this notion of corporate governance somebody give me a good definition of what strong corporate governance means to the company what does it mean when I say a company is strong corporate governance foreign around Business Schools all the time corporate governance what does that mean good that's good management right basically there are things we describe for good management and bad management but corporate governance is not about good or bad management it's about go ahead it's about being able to change management boil it down to Basics you can talk about Board of direct you said did you say control diversity so let's separate good and bad management you can have a good manager who's a dictator you have a bad manager's a dictator but they're both dictators the essence of corporate governance is you can change the management of a company so let's sit back right for 30 years now in finance we've preached the gospel of corporate governance we need corporate governance or companies let's suppose you're valuing a company with bad corporate governance it's already what am I telling you in this company you have zero chance of changing the management of the company let's load the dice and assume that this company is badly managed and badly run because remember when you have bad corporate governance but the company is well run you don't complain right it's like being in Singapore Lee Kuan Yew is effectively no going to run the country but I'm okay with that he's benevolent dictators nobody worries about but malevolent dictate is not so much it's a badly managed badly run company you do a discounted cash flow evaluation you value the company and then you say you know what this company is bad corporate governance should you discount the value for that bad corporate governance what do you think did you value you value the company right you came up with the cash flows you had came up with a discount rate and you knew the company is badly managed and badly run presumably you built that into your forecast you've essentially given them a terrible return on Capital but they keep reinvesting as if there's no tomorrow you give them terrible growth rate value is low if you've done this you've already punished the company for bad corporate governance in fact if you have good corporate governance and you have a badly run company what would you do differently in the company it starts off with the same bad numbers but if there's good corporate governance what do you assume will happen over time the management will get changed when you move your numbers towards industry averages as I know many of you are doing in your story whether you like it or not you're implicitly making assumptions that your company will change and move and that might or might not be true depending on the company and who's running the company long story short if you've done a valuations right there is no need to discount it for corporate governance because it's already in there the value already reflects it because you built it into the assumptions if somebody else did the valuation then all bets are up you have to look at what they've assumed to make a judgment on whether to Discount that value take a second question let's say you're valuing a distressed company now basically it's got a lot of debt it could go under go bankrupt it's it's doing terribly right now but you decide to fix the company on your spreadsheet you know how you fix a travel company and strategy they make small revenues the big revenues you make the losses and the profits you bring your debt ratio down everything is easy to do on a spreadsheet you make it a nice healthy company give it a big terminal value you discount it all back let's say you've been realistic in all these assumptions come up with the value for sure will you tend to overvalue or undervalue distressed companies with a discounted cash flow model assuming you've been realistic in your cash flows or will you get the correct value should it be already in there like it was for corporate governance what do you do in the DCF you estimate cash flows you have one year two year three year five year ten Nirvana not forever you value your business as a going concern right what are you missing when you what what is can I play Devil's Advocate because when you do this at your wherever you go to work you know what people are going to say why don't you just use a higher discount rate in fact here's the problem discount rates were designed to capture operating risk what kind of risk is this truncation risk the risk there will not be in a year three is not a risk you can easily capture in a discount rate so here's what's going to happen even if you're realistic about adjusting this contracts for the fact this is a risky company it's not going to be enough because if the company is not going to be around next week how high does the discount rate have to get to reflect that So today we're going to talk about what to do about declining companies or distressed companies we worry about will this company make it so both issues which have big implications let's go back to where we were in the notes I think we were in the middle of talking about declining companies and I talked about the psychological there is psychological barriers when you value a declining company you've got to have negative Revenue growth so I'm going to ask this question open this question you're each valuing a company don't tell me you're not because by Friday you're supposed to turn in a company so whether you want it or not you're valuing a company how many of you are using negative or expecting negative Revenue growth at your companies I know she she actually has zero Revenue that she put negative Revenue growth on talk about depressing outlook for the company one person you know what I asked this question whenever I run into groups of appraisers and people doing well these are people who've been building companies for 40 years you know how many of these people have never used the negative Revenue growth to ever value a company this is tricus Art because don't some companies shrink in the real world how come these people never seem to run into those companies or maybe they run into them but they feel so psychologically unwilling to use a negative Revenue growth rate that they take the minus and make it into a plus it's a psychological barrier so if you're valuing a declining company putting in a negative Revenue growth and shrinking margin seems almost unnatural to do because what hardwired as human beings to be optimistic and this seems like you're being unfair to the company but it is reality and getting over that psychological barrier is what you need to do to get a value for a declining company so my JCPenney evaluation this is my optimistic valuation of JCPenney my optimistic valuation of JCPenney I have minus three percent growth for the next five years you know what this effectively means the shutting stores that and actually they're going to do it logically if you're a brick and mortar retailer you're doing badly which stores are you going to shut down first actually your most expensive ones that suck up Capital the New York City store that Bed Bath and Beyond owns need to be shut down first because the least commitments are so large that they can't cover the operating income so you're going to start shutting stores down as you shut stores down remember your less Source are going to be happy you're leaving a lease and they're going to pay you that negative reinvestment is actually cash you're getting as you're shrinking so everything you're doing is reverse right instead of reinvesting to grow your shrinking and actually taking cash out of the company you're making a company smaller and here's the optimistic part of my story eventually I assume that there's a steady state for JCPenney where they will find stores where there are people who still want to come in maybe in the Midwest and older people basically there is a subset about the population that might not be true and we'll talk about what to do that so by the time you get to year seven or eight this company is about 25 to 30 percent smaller than it is today but it's now found a steady state and it can grow at the inflation rate of the growth rate of the economy beyond that if you're not that upbeat and you're wearing Bed Bath and Beyond saying look nobody's ever going to come into a bed bath and be honest or Beyond year five you know what you should do project the cash flow through your fiber as they shrink and at the end of year five instead of having a terminal value is put in a liquidation value where they just walk away from their leases and get whatever they can so that's declining companies let's talk about distress companies step back and this is something I didn't know until I'd been working with evaluation for a while this is an implicit assumption rather than explicit one discounted cash flow valuations value companies as going concerns assume that so in this kind of cash flow evaluation it's not that you assume a company will never have a bad year if you assume that you always bounce back from a bad year you keep going that's what allows you to keep the cash flows going and for most healthy companies that's okay so if you're valuing a company which is investment grade Triple B single a double a triple a traditional discounted cash flow evaluation works fine but let's say you're valuing a company which is either a young company or an older company that is in distress I mean classic measures of distress if you have rating is your single B Triple C Double C as noted earlier if you use a discounted cash flow evaluation you could overvalue the company because you're missing what happens if you're not unable to make a debt paper so here's what I'm going to suggest you do instead of trying to pump up the discount rate which is what some people try to do deal with distress directly what does that mean estimated likelihood that your company will not be able to make it and then ask yourself a follow-up question my company is not able to make it what will I get as the equity invest in the company you're saying how the heck am I going to answer the first question I'm going to give you three ways of estimating a likelihood that your company will not make it and this is going to be a lot easier than estimating failure rates for startups the first is many distressed companies will have a bond rating when you can get a bond rating for your company that Bond rating goes with the likelihood of failure why because if I go back Bond ratings have been around 100 years people have tracked what percentage of Triple B Double B single B rated bonds default over the following 10 years I can give you a statistic if you're triple B rated there's a seven percent chance that you will not make it if you're double B rated that jumps to 15 if you're Triple C rate it could be 35 based on history that's one first one the second is in a project it's actually it's actually a fun approach it's the creative approach we use bond prices to estimate the property of failure let's face it Equity investors are easily distracted shiny baubles look at growth they're so excited about it they don't look at the company Bond investors much as I don't like to hang out around them are single-minded what do Bond investors care about will I get paid will I get paid will I get paid what's the growth I don't care will I get paid will I get paid and you got to give them credit for the focus Bond investors tend to be much better at focusing on default risk because that's all they care about so I'm going to use bond prices to back out the likelihood of the form we are don't you're saying what if I don't have either a bond rating or a bond price I'll give you a third approach it's a statistical approach called a probate it looks like a regression but it's a way of estimating the probability of default for a company based on observable characters like how much debt do you have what's your interest coverage ratio example of a company so you can see this player it's a company called Las Vegas sets heard of it it's a casino company I'm going to say something general about Casino companies and you might think it's unfair but I think it's true if you look empirically at this statement Casino companies tend to be run by megalomaniacs now if you don't believe me take a look at the biggest casino companies wind resorts Steve win Las Vegas Sands was run by a guy called Sheldon Addison he owned 52 percent of the company this is part of the story he controlled the company it's a publicly traded company and in the 90 in the in the first part of the century 2000 to 2007 when the fastest growing Casino companies in the world it built two casinos in Vegas a casino elsewhere in the U.S a casino in Macau and if you are from Singapore they built this monstrosity called The Marina Bay Sands it's shaped like a ship you know I once stayed there never again you know they have a swimming pool on top of the ship which doesn't even make sense but basically it's just huge but each of them is a huge infrastructure investment you guys ever stayed at the Bellagio I've been lost in that place more often than I want to be there are 28 restaurants just in the Bellagio think about it 28 restaurants and I mean you walk in the wrong direction the Bellagio you can be a half a mile away from where you need to be but each of these casinos cost hundreds of millions of dollars which you need to raise Capital what are the two ways you can raise capital you can borrow money or issue shares and here's where the 52 percent comes into play you're a megalomaniac what do you value most of all control right you want 52 of shares and you want to build a new casino and say should I issue shares should I borrow money guess which one you go with you're always going to go to borrowed money and that's exactly how Las Vegas Sands grew between 2000 and 2007. borrow money build another casino borrow money build Marina Bay Sands and when times are good people don't mind right it was one of the most highly recommended Casino stocks in 2007. and then 2008 hit and two things happened first was the bottom fell out of the casino business because the economy was in a recession and nobody wanted to fly to Vegas to gamble they didn't have money the second was all that debt that had been accumulated that nobody had noticed over the previous seven years people woke up and say you have a lot of debt as if it suddenly showed up like Mana from heaven or 15 billion this is a valuation I did of Las Vegas Sands in February of 2009. and I'll set the set the stage as I was doing the valuation I was reading new stories about Las Vegas ants not making it through the next six months that it might not make the next interest payment it was hugely distressed company but undaunted I said okay I'm going to Value the company I'm going to fix its problems so here's how I fix the problems I allowed revenues to grow back as people came back into casinos I let the margins climb back to what they used to be pre-2008 and as they were doing all of this I had lowered my debt ratio from 73 to 50 making it a nice healthy Casino none of these are unrealistic or implausible assumptions if for Las Vegas sense recovers this is exactly what will happen that leads me to a high terminal value take the present value the value per share that I got for Las Vegas Sands was eight dollars and 12 cents per share the stock was at 425. so ask me the question you know the question I told you should ask anytime somebody does a valuation what's the question am I buying and my answer in 2009 would have been no that led to some soul searching because if the value I'm getting is eight dollars and twelve cents and the stock price is 425. it's almost double the stock price right so what's holding me back those rumors that are floating around that Las Vegas Sands will not make it let me explain what is this value the 8.12 is the value for Las Vegas Sands assuming it makes it back to health it could happen but there's also a chance it might not in which case I have to ask what will my Equity be worth so I decided to answer the question what is the likelihood that Las Vegas Sands will not make it so I'll give you a couple of ways of doing it the simplistic way the easy way and there's a way I'd suggest most of you follow is Las Vegas stands at a bond rating its Bond rating was B plus you can see the ratings agencies were already getting scared about the future a B plus rated Bond at least in 2009 the likelihood of default in the bond over the ten following 10 years is 28 percent so if I followed that approach there's there's a 72 percent chance that Las Vegas Sands will make it as a going concern and a 28 chance it'll fail what I've got is a value eight dollars and 12 cents captures the 72 percent when I told I'd give you a more creative way of estimating the likelihood of default for this I went to the bond market and there was a seven year Las Vegas Sands bond with the 6.375 coupon which was trading at five twenty nine dollars remember bonds have a face value of a thousand so when you trade well below face value it's a deeply discounted Bond why because people are scared they won't get the cash back now the way we normally price bonds is we take the promise coupons and face value and discount them back at this default risk adjusted rate I'm not going to do that instead here's what I'm going to do I'm going to take the promise coupon 63.75 is the coupon every year that's 6. 6.375 but to get that coupon what has to be true the company is to be around so I multiplied by the probability that the company stays around one minus the failure rate and I do this for each of the cash flows and of course there's that face value at the end and because I've adjusted my coupons for risks remember these are now no longer promise coupons or expected coupons I can discount them back at the risk period I know this this is convoluted but hang in there I have the price of the bond right I have the coupons and the face value at the risk credit what's the only number in this equation I don't have the probability of distress you used to solve a function in Excel for the gold seek function you can do it solve for the probability of distress and it came back with a number 13.5 percent you're saying what does that even mean given how the bonds were priced is it thirteen and a half percent chance each year that the bond will not make it through the end of the year you think that's not very much that's in one year how long do I have to live to see Nirvana I have to get to your 10. so I have to survive here one year two year three so basically think of an 86 chance of failure of survival compounded over 10 years I end up with 23 now we're getting into scary low numbers there's if you believe the bond market there's a 23 chance I will get to your attendant collect the eight dollars and 12 cents and a 77 chance of what that they will go Bank in which case what do they have to do sell the casinos to whom other Casino companies all of whom are equally in trouble you can almost guarantee that you're going to get a huge discount on the Marina Bay Sands when you try to sell it and how much do you think your Equity is going to be worth it they actually have to liquidate this company zero thank God for limited liability otherwise they'll be coming after the rest of your work right so here's what I have baby dollars and 12 cents is my value if the company makes it but there's only a 23 chance and zero as my value of the company doesn't make it there's a 77 chance my expected value is a dollar ninety two now if you ask me am I buying of course not I think it was only a dollar ninety two it's an escape hatch but I think it's a rational escape hatch with distress companies I'm not going to buy based on the DCF value and that's why I put the failure rate into the spreadsheet I did this after 2009 because I said I can't leave this as an afterthought if you have a company that you're worried will not make it and I know you can't adjust the discount rate for it the failure rate becomes that mechanism for adjusting for the likelihood that your company will not make because there's real money behind it right the ratings agency is to the extent that they lag they invented the rating space approach it's simple but there's no price right now it's just a ratings engine we know ratings and see they're late to the party right so when a company gets into trouble they're often chasing they're often three to six months behind so if you feel the bond market is too volatile you might go with the ratings approach but but the stress companies sometimes they will lag what's actually happening in the market yes that's a good point I have actually simplified the process by assuming 13 and a half percent is a compounded annual but in the real world here's what it'll look like it's probably 40 chance of failure in year one dropping off so the way this will show up is Las Vegas sense makes it through your one the property of survival increases dramatically so I've done it for Simplicity here but you could actually use a one-year bond to get the one-year property the two-year so you could almost get a term structure of failure rate so you can get failure rates each year is it worth the trouble if you have a truly distressed company this might be what makes or breaks your Equity value but otherwise you're probably better off smoothing it up but it's a good you know the assumption that that that property stays the same it's probably unrealistic because failure rates are probably higher early on now move on to Emerging Market companies I have to be quite clear much of what I said about Emerging Market companies is not exclusive to Emerging Market companies I don't mean to pick on them but you're more likely to run into them with Emerging Market companies so let's go through the four questions what do your cash flows from existing assets what do you look at financial statements right you look at financial statements for U.S companies for cash for U.S company financial statements for European company for Europe in a financial statement for a Chinese company for a Chinese company already you can see where this is going the more you trust those financial statements the more secure you feel about I know what the cash flow was last year now I when I first started writing Emerging Market companies 35 years ago I remember How Deep The Divide was between Emerging Market accounting an accounting in the U.S or Europe today we actually have more convergent you don't realize it because you don't have the benefit looking across time but when you complain about a Chinese company's accounting and he said they're probably doing some shady things they used to do far more shady things probably 10 years ago you're moving in the right direction but there's only so much you can do but that's it the the to the degree that these numbers are opaque and they're holding back things you have to make your best Testament that's going to make you uncomfortable second when I ask you what's the value of growth that same opacity that affected how much the company actually makes in earnings is going to affect what in when you compute that return on Equity or return invested Capital so every question you're going to feel a little more doubtful about your answers because you just don't trust the numbers nothing you can do about it but you're going in with more doubt in your mind with that set up let's talk a little bit about the specific issues you will have to confront first many Emerging Markets there is this country risk issue that's going to become front and center you value Brazilian company the only thing you might Brazil the country as much as you're thinking about the company and my recommendation with country risk is something that's an extension of what we did in the context of discussing countries after I estimated the country risk premiums for every country I said don't use a bludgeon don't take every company in a country and attach the country risk premium to it look at where it gets its revenues and just for the fact that if you're an Indian company that gets 90 percent of your revenues outside India you're less risky than an Indian company that gets a hundred percent and the two approaches we did to bring that in one was to take a weighted average of the equity risk premium so all the countries you operate in and give you an equity risk cream that reflects it using either production or revenue is wage the otherwise if you had a single country that worried remember embryer in 2004 I computed a Lambda put a very specific country in a very specific game so if you're writing a Nigerian oil company and you're worried about Nigerian country risk a Lambda approach might work for you because it's it's more focused it's more detailed so that's the first stop country risk make sure it's in your analysis but make sure you treat a company based on where its business is done where its operations are second and this is something that I run into all the time at the Emerging Market analysts which is what do we do about currency risk so let's first step back when we talk about currency risk you've got to be very clear that you're not talking about expected devaluation in a currency because that's not risk you can bring that in risk is that you get unexpected evaluation think about what we do when we deal with high inflation currencies so let's say you're you're looking at a company in Brazilian Reals and the inflation rate in Brazil is nine percent and the inflation rate in the US is two percent first you use a much higher discount rate that takes care of the higher inflation Brazil but also when you do expected exchange rates remember how you get expected exchange rates when you have a high inflation currency versus a low inflation currency let's stay with the Brazil example inflation rate in Brazil is nine percent inflation rate in the US is two percent what would he expect to happen to the REI or the real over time in terms of devaluation roughly how much will it devalue each year but seven percent the difference between the two inflation rates so when people say are you dealing with that in a cash flow you're already bringing in expected devaluation so if that's your concern that you have a currency that will devalue I should already be building into your cash flows but it's true that that actual devaluation might be different from the expected devaluation you know how this will show up some of you when you look at your income statements will see an exchange rate gain or loss line item which can go positive some years negative as you say what the heck is that that's coming from differences in currencies over time so what do we do about that probably nothing sounds like a strange thing to say but remember if you are why do we use betas because investors are Diversified they can remove from specific risk if you're a company where in a currency where there's significant risk that the currency could devalue more or less but that company is one of a hundred companies that I own all of which are in different countries different currencies currency risk is one of those classic risks that in a global portfolio will start to average out because it can cut in both directions if your investors are not Global then maybe you can adjust for currency risk and bring in an additional premium because there's additional uncertainty but for the most part let currency risk code shouldn't be affecting your discount rates because investors can diversify it away so just to show you that currencies don't matter I'm going to take an example it's a company called Infosys it's an Indian Outsourcing company gets more than 90 percent of its revenues from outside India primarily the US and Europe I valued Infosys I think this was in 2017 in rupees risk-free rate in rupees then was five percent inflation rate is four percent you work it through I come up with a value per share of 614 rupees per share so they've done everything in rupees one second after I finished my rupee valuation I revalued in forces entirely in dollars let's look at what will change first I'm going from a five percent risk-free rate to a two percent risk credit this is good right in terms of discount rates I end up with a much lower discount rate cost of capital in US Dollars than in rupees right change nothing else lower discount rate should make my value higher right but I'm not quite done when I did my growth tricks in when I did my rupee evaluation those growth rates are rupee growth rate so what does that mean the those growth rates reflect a higher inflation in the rupee and they're being pushed up by that inflation if I replace those with US dollar growth rates same company same point in time it's not that I'm getting more pessimistic but there's less of a in this case a wind at your back pushing up the growth rate because you have lower inflation so your discount rate decreases because of inflation your growth rate drops because of the same inflation you can see what the end result is going to be right you have lower cash flows a lower discount rate and you take the present value the value per share that I got for Infosys at the same time that I'd done the repeat valuation was 12.79 which converted at the exchange rate that day would have given me exactly the same value per share as doing it all in rupees this is incredibly good news if any of you are valuing a Turkish company or an Egyptian company God help you a Russian company right now and you're trying to do everything and Turkish lira Russian rubles or Egyptian pounds you're probably driving yourself crazy because when you have 15 18 20 risk free rates everything becomes messy here's my advice switch away to a different currency you can value a Russian company in euros you can value an Egyptian company in US dollars you're not making a good company into a Bad Company you're just changing your measurement mechanism that's all currencies do and it kind of reinforces what I said about currency when you talked about risk free rates but it's good to see the effect on valued player and where it plays out it affects everything your discount rate your growth rate your cash flows But ultimately the one thing it doesn't affect is your value per share today because everything cancels out any questions on currencies let's talk about corporate governance as I said this this focus on corporate governance in finance started with the paper written by Michael Jensen and William meckling this is 1974. but for the first time they said what managers do is not always in the best interest it was stating the obvious but they actually put it out there in the open they said what managers have their own incentive they want to protect their jobs they want to earn more so what they do as managers might not match up to what their shareholders want them to do hence was born corporate governance the argument being that you want managers to act and shareholders interest because it's their company it's been hijacked recently by stakeholder wealth maximization but the original idea was manages work for shareholders and we've talked about how to improve corporate governance but the reality is Corporate governance it's crappy in many parts of the world for all kinds of reasons and in much of the world Charities have little or no power to change the way management makes decisions this is a problem around the world but it's more so a problem in Emerging Markets because of the history a lot of these Emerging Markets used to have family group companies that were privately around that are publicly traded and because of the structure the pyramids in the you know in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia and the holding structures the family group holding structures in it it's very difficult to change the way a company's run and that's where we started the discussion today what do you do about those companies and I said if you've done the valuation and you've controlled the earnings in the cash flows it's already in there so I'm going to use an example to illustrate this process it's a company called Cube Investments that I've known since I was a little kid I grew up in that part of the world they're publicly traded company their family control company so but three trips ago I usually go back once a year to India to visit you know because I'm I left India in 1979 at my connections a weekend but I still have family in India I go back once a year you know the CEO of this company learned I was coming and he said can you come in and talk to our top management and I couldn't say no because I've known this person since I was very young so I said okay and I said what do you want to talk about he said we think our stock is massively underpriced it's trading at 101 rupees per share which is like four times earnings or five times earnings I said okay and I said I can't make any promises that I'll confirm your biases I'll come in and do a valuation and he said I don't understand why it's 101 rupees we're growing fast as a company we're actually very you know clearly missing something so I walked in and I took a look at the numbers and I'll take you through the valuation and you're going to very quickly see why the market is far more pessimistic about the company in the family group is so this is a company that's reinvesting a lot in fact in the most recent 12 months leading into this valuation they've been reinvesting about 113 so we're reinvesting a lot this is good right reinvestment High reinvestment leads to higher growth when I've made my forecast the first thing I did was I I smoothed that out because that number jumped around I used to 60 dream which already let some people say well you're being unfair to us we're reinvesting far more I said wait a moment because you're not you're going to see if this is actually helping you or hurting so I used to 60 reinvestment rate they were reinvesting a lot but the return in capital they were earning as a company was about 9.2 percent now that doesn't sound bad right if you think in U.S dollar terms in 2022 but this was an Indian rupee terms in 2004 or 2005 and the risk-free rate then in Indian rupees was 12 and their cost to Capital was about 16.2 percent let me pause right that they're growing they're reinvesting a lot in projects that make 9.2 percent with a costly capital of 16.2 percent this is going bad really fast right what happens when you grow and you reinvest and earn a return you're destroying values you grow the faster you do it the more you're going to destroy value now normally when I see a company like this in the US I assume that sanity will come to the company sooner or later so when I get to my terminal value I'm in a more forgiving mood and I say you know what something will change so what do we do we assume that you know I'm not going to assume no some some amazing thing is going to happen but I'm going to assume return capital is going to converge on cost to Capital in terminal value you know even though you're destroying value and that will give them a terminal value that reflects at least zero value destruction Beyond I didn't do that here you know why because the management didn't think there was a problem they thought we're growing why are they being you know this is the problem your focus becomes growth growth and more growth and not asking the question of is this growth that creates or destroys value so here's what I did in my terminal value I gave them a return on Capital equal to the I'm sorry return on Capital that continued to be well below the cost to cap so what are they doing not only if they destroy value for the next five years they're going to do it forever this is the price of bad corporate governance because this is a family control company there's nothing I can do to change them if they don't think there's a problem they're going to keep doing this the value per share that I got was 62 rupees the CEO was massively disappointed he expected me to come back with 200 rupees per share and the market is wrong and I said you know what the Market's probably being too generous to you it should probably be pricing you at 62 rupees so I asked for suggestions because this was the entire top Management Group what do you think I'm missing here and most of them said well you're missing the fact that we're reinvesting more you should use a higher reinvestment rate so I went along and I used 100 reinvestment rate and guess what happened to the 64 62 rupees it became 45 rupees let me make it 200 percent you're growing even faster you'll become 25 rupees you want to drive it to zero keep reinvesting like you're doing and triple that a month and very quickly they saw that to increase value that they needed to take their focus away from doing more Acquisitions and reinvesting more to reinvesting better that's a healthy move it doesn't come easily so that's the other path I took them down and said what instead of take nine percent returns you took 12 returns still below the costic app the value per share goes from 64 Rupees to 100 rupees you push it up to 16 percent it goes up to 150 rupees you're saying what if we can't find projects that make 16 I think I said that's easy stop reinvesting because nobody forces you to reinvest if you have a zero reinvestment rate here you get 150 rupees per share send all your project managers home stop looking for projects you will be better off it sounds incredibly negative but it's what's true in bad businesses because the more you look the more danger you put yourself into because you keep hoping that this is the project that will turn you around so when you think about corporate governance that's where it's going to show up not just in the numbers you start the valuation with but what you move your numbers to so when I ask you what's your target margin I know this was not in the back of your head but it might have to come to the Forefront because if you're valuing a company with bad management it's got low margins even though the industry averages are much higher don't assume they can automatically go to those industry averages because your managers might be in too much denial to even make that fix any questions sorry fourth issue this is an issue that we ran into when we talked about loose sense I said the darks the the most difficult scenarios in valuation is a company with lots of cross orders because those cross-soldings are opaque it's they're difficult to Value see left holding this bag of this is worth 45 million but I'm not quite sure what's in there now again this is not exclusive to Emerging Market companies but you're more likely to run into this with Emerging Market companies because of the family group history so here again we went to go go back to basically in a perfect world what would you like to do we'd like to value each cross holding separately with the fundamentals for that crossbody growth cash flows risk but that's going to be incredibly difficult to do with these family group companies we have 30 40 50 cross Holdings so again I'm going to use an Indian example to illustrate this it's a group called the tarda group it's one of India's oldest family groups it's been around 150 years well regarded group I took four Tata companies and I'm going to cut to the chase I valued all four see the the blue Parts in this no the blue Parts in this in this graph are my intrinsic valuations for each company what is that free cash for the firm cost to Capital all that hard work we put in is in the blue the red part is actually the value of the Cross Holdings often as specified by the accountants why because I can't look Beyond it's opaque I don't know what's behind there photograph chemical for instance half the value comes from its cross Holdings half comes from intrinsic value you think so what when I come up with a value per share for data chemicals I feel a lot more shaky about that value than I do for data Consulting Services because so much so much of the value comes from this brown bag where I can't look inside the bag now why do you think data Consulting Services is less exposed to that the entire motor starter steel or data chemicals probably need some history what do you think it is did any of these companies how did these companies get these cross Holdings in the first place here's how these companies ended up with these cross orders they didn't actually invest in each other but 50 years ago these were all privately owned companies the Tata family owned all of these companies so let's say Tata Motors wanted to build a new Factory didn't have enough money TARTA steel did well that year remember the family owned both companies so you know what they did they took money out of Tata steel they invest in automotives the accounting then would give Tata steel shares and Tara Motors because the debit has to have a credit this is an accident of History it's not some conspiracy to make your life difficult and the older company is the more it's had to do this data Consulting Services is the youngest of these companies it hasn't had a chance to even accumulate these cross Holdings but it does mean that we're investing in family group companies that the younger companies in the group are going to be easier to Value than the older companies precisely for this reason the cross-holding problem doesn't quite go away but it's much smaller which brings me to the final issue we talked about truncation risk in the case of distressed companies there the truncation risk is if I don't make my debt payment life ends for me as a company but truncation risk can take lots of different forms I remember about uh 10 years ago it was middle of winter I was teaching here and somebody from Antigua Antigua Antigua called and he said can you come in and do a valuation conference we can't afford to pay you it's really cold here and it's Antigua sounds really good they're going to put me up at a nice hotel I show up and do a valuation seminar I talk about betas and there's a group of people antiguing business people and they're all thinking about the risks I'm describing this and that's not the risk we worry about that's not the risk and I get to the end and they said you haven't talked about the risk we're we're all worried about you know what they were worried about they're mostly tourism related businesses and they said our worries there's going to be a hurricane you could effectively wipe out our old business he said why do they insure themselves you know how much it'll cost you if you're an antiguing company to go out and buy insurance against it against a hurricane that's a truncation risk I have a great Hotel business right on the beach but tomorrow it could be part of the ocean and there goes my hotel business right same phenomenon applies if you're in the parts of the Middle East which are incredibly risky you've got a hotel like remember that that five-star hotel was it in Egypt that got hit by terrorists got burned to the ground there goes your business overnight terrorism risk is truncation risk and at least I've had at least 25 students who've gone through this class so from Venezuela they've gone back some of them are very successful business people remember the last time I had a conversation about maybe three or four years ago you know but somebody graduated 20 years ago is running a business and calls me and he says look my business is doing very well but he sounds down and I say hey business is doing well this is good right he said but people are noticing and I said that's very good right and he said some people who are noticing are in the government and then I knew where this discussion was going he said look we're worried that we might be nationalized how do I bring that into my valuation you can't bring that into your cash flows your discount rate so I said do the same thing with the address what are the things you need to answer you need to answer the question what is the likelihood that I'll be nationalized and that's going to be a function of how well do you get along with the government what kind of business are you in and then what will you receive if you do if you get nationalized you're not going to receive fair value maybe you'll receive half a fair value 20 of fair value that basically is what you're trying to do when you think about you know when you think about truncationary separated from everything else in fact any time you have discrete risk it's better to do multiple valuations and to try to fit it all into one one scenario so I'm going to use an example to illustrate this this was about what is it 2019 I think a ramco chose to call Publix one of the valuations of the week in case you got to it you're probably going to listen to something you read in my post you didn't get to it but it's now you're going to hear it for the first time 2019 aramco announces that it's going to go public it's one of the if you think about it's the most astonishing IPO of all time why because the minute after ramco went public they were instantaneously the largest market cap company in the world they were they're the market cap greater than Apple they're actually going public with like one and a half percent or two percent of shares so they're doing it just to be public so that a market price out there so I decided to value a ramco easiest of all valuations to do because if you think about it what is the ROM Coast value come from it's basically 300 million barrels of oil under the ground in fact it's one of the few evaluations of publicly traded companies or instead of using a terminal value I used 50 years extracted all the oil from the ground to put a terminal value of zero he's saying why how much are you going to pay for the Saudi Sands not much right after the oil is gone there's nothing there so it's 50 years of cash flows I did it with the dividend discount model of free care but they basically all gave me values of about 1.7 maybe 1.75 trillion dollars a lot of value from having 300 million barrels of oil on which the cost of extraction is three to four dollars a barrel and everybody else faces what fifteen twenty twenty five dollar costs but after I finished the valuation I stopped and asked a question as an investor am I capturing the risks I'm exposed to technically I am right there's a discount rate there's a beta what is a beta capture the fact that in Oil Company what does the equity risk premium reflect the equity risk premium for Saudi Arabia but remind me again how we got country risk premiums we looked at the rating for our country and Saudi Arabia has a pretty good rating because it doesn't have much default risk and we give it an equity risk premium that reflects I think we're not capturing the risk in a ramco completely because the risk you're concerned about here is you're not buying a company you're buying a country eighty percent of Saudi Arabia's GDP comes from oil and aramco is the instrument that delivers it all so you're basically buying a piece of Saudi Arabia and you're not just buying a piece of Saudi Arabia buying a piece of the Saudi royal family because for better words there is that implicit assumption that this country is going to continue to be run the way it is and we're going to get the royalties that they promised us could any one of these links get broken absolutely think of how quickly Egypt changed hands you know what was it the was it 2009 2010 how quickly you went from hey this is a dictatorship for the rest of the life of you know to what happens next week so I tried that's all I can do try to assess the likelihood of regime change in Saudi Arabia I am as a terrible political so take this with multiple grains of salt because I have no idea about about Middle Eastern politics you're talking about 50 years right I'm going to assume there's at least a 20 chance that something will happen a regime change will happen in Saudi Arabia of the next 50 years maybe I'm overestimating it maybe I'm underestimating and then I had to ask and said the follow-up question if there's a regime change what will happen to my value novice takes over then I know exactly what's going to happen to my value but let's assume it's an intermediate regime something that says no regime that says we're going to let a ramco run as a company but we're going to double the royalty because the way countries often try to have their cake and eat it too is rather than nationalize the oil company and give up the stream they just double your royalty the royalties you have to pay per barrel of oil you extract what's that going to do it's going to instantaneously reduce your cash flows as a company in this case I've assumed you have the value of the company there's an 80 chance that that won't happen the 1.65 trillion estimated holds the 20 of the time there's a regime change I'm going to attach a much slower value and that expected value then tries at least to factor in political risk now earlier this year we remember there's the adarni group getting one of the strengths for the adani group is what what's one of its biggest strengths connections right connections to the government they enter the infrastructure business that can work in your favor could that work against you they have elections and elections sometimes bring in a different government so if you have a business built on connections and the other side wins you can almost predict what's going to happen the day after right your infrastructure projects are going to get pulled back they're going to put multiple inquiries going into briberies and Scandals your business model could collapse if you have to Value the identity group it's probably better to Value it twice once with your preferred party or their preferred party winning the election the other with the other side winning the election you're going to get different values and then you've got to attach properties you're saying this isn't what I signed up to do when I was in equity research analyst you might not have but new value complex the only group what choice do you have I remember valuing easyJet in 2019. you guys know what what EasyJet does It's a UK based discount airline that flies middle class britishers to Spain and Greece in the winter that's the basic business model is flying vacation is out of the UK into sunny or parts of Europe in 2019 was Peak brexit anxiety uncertainty about what will happen and the reason this has particular relevance for EasyJet is the EU has very specific rules on what you need to do to be able to fly in the EU so if there was no brexit or or a hard brexit but the UK just walked away it was very likely that EasyJet would cease to exist as a company unless it's so they had a backup plan that if brexit there was a hard brexit they would move their headquarters somewhere in Austria and fly out of there because they wouldn't have there should be an extraordinarily expensive endeavor so when I valued EasyJet in 2019 I validated three times once with hard brexit which means the UK walks away no no agreements in place soft brexit or no brexit maybe they'd back away from the ledge we didn't know in 2019 I got three different values of course I still had the responsibility of estimating the likelihood of each of those and taking an expected value but what I'm trying to say is if you have a company where the value of the company can be very different depending on two scenarios a regulatory change a political change rather than bring them all into one valuation it's easier to Value them two or three times and take an expected value and it'll be more realistic we'll force you to think about where's the real uncertainty coming from let's talk about dialing Banks I told you that I screwed up pre-2008 when I made that statement valuing Banks is easy but I also told you what drove that statement it was two assumption the assumption that Banks were run by sensible people and the second was that the regulatory overlay actually worked 2008 taught me that's both those assumptions we're not going to hold so what I'm going to take you is on a journey of how Bank valuation has or should have evolved over time and why banks used to be easy to Value them and the markets were used and why we might need to abandon those morals so let's start questions that you need to answer to Value any company and apply them to Banks so what's the first question what are your cash flows from existing assets right so when you do that what do you do you start with the earnings you add back depreciation you subtract subtract capex you subtract change in working carefully you come up with cash flows you want to try that for a bank let's start the earnings you can find right so you can't find operating income there's no such thing as operating income you can find net income at least you keep using that's okay I can do an equity cash flow then you look for depreciation you think there's hardly any depreciation what's to depreciate you look for capex what capex and you look for a working capital by some definitions everything on a bank is working capital and nothing is working capital so for the longest time with banks here's what we end up with you throw up your hands and you say I don't know what the cash flow is and you know what you do then right if you cannot estimate cash flow to equity because you can't get those intermediate items you look at dividends and what are you doing you're assuming that Banks pay out what they can afford to do this is why I assume I said you have to assume that banks are run by sensible people that they're paying out what they can afford to pay now when we do cost of equity for a traditional company what do we do we start with the unlevered beta for the business we bring in the debt to equity ratio we re-level the beta with the bank you can't do that we don't know what a debt to equity ratio for a bank is because again everything is dead or nothing is dead so with banks we actually use the Levitt beta for a business is the beta in other words we're acting as if every bank is equally risky and our defense for doing that was that the regulatory guys are not going to let Banks get really risky there's no such thing as a Silicon Valley Bank in that regulatory environment now do you see why the dividend discount model this was the last Bastion for the dividend discount model banks used to be valued the dividend discount model and when we did that whether we liked it or not we were making those two assumptions with banks I describe your the what you go through as a as entering into a Faustian bargain the file student bargain is banks are opaque you don't know much about what's happening behind the surface but you're okay with it because you got regulatory authorities on the other side making sure they're not doing something that can hurt you so if you think about valing Banks they always just project our dividends so I'm going to take an example of an unconventional Bank to show you how dividend discount mods are actually a lot more flexible any because often people say well you can use a dividend discount model only if a company is mature and it's paying out a big difference not true in fact you can use a dividend discount model to value a non-dividend paying back to think that is absurd but here's why it works this evaluation I did of Egyptian bank called CIB it's a pretty big Egyptian Bank well regarded and I wanted to Value something in Egyptian pounds I'd never valued a company in Egyptian pounds and I felt that it was a big part an empty part of my life I had to fill it by valuing back so I'm going to take you through the process of valuing C having so I'm doing my valuation Egyptian pounds I need a risk-free rate in Egyptian parts and remember this now when we did risk three rates I talked about there's no Government Bond rate in Egyptian pounds I did that little trick of taking the UST bond rate and adjusting for the differential inflation there's my risk-free rate ten and a half percent that's going to frame all of the numbers you're going to see because my risk free rate is so high and I'm in a risky country guess what my cost of equity looks like 23.25 if I applied that to a U.S Bank in US Dollars that bank is going to be dead in the water it's a huge discount rate but here's why it's going to be okay at CIB 's return in equity was 42 percent partly because you're in a high inflation economy and partly because you're a bank in a market where they have very little competition they're able to charge whatever they want and get away with it so they have a huge return on equity and given that they were reinvesting or at a retention age of 75 their growth rate is 32 so this is a high growth bank with a high cost of equity and a low payout ratio normally not ingredients that you would think going to Dividend discount model but here's why it works when I start the process the payout ratio is only 25 they have a high growth rate and a high cost of equity over time just like at any other company growth is going to level up in this case my growth rate goes from 31 down to 10 percent in perpetuity that sounds very high right if I did a valuation and accompanying US Dollars and used 10 percent a year forever the valuation is going to blow up here it's okay because my inflation rate is 9 10 my risk-free rate is 10 and a half percent so my growth rate and perpetuity is 10. but as my growth rate decreases my payout ratio which is 25 increases up to 60 so I'm doing exactly what I do in any other valuation following the same principles as growth gets lower I'm reinvesting less as I reinvest less there's more dividends to pair so my dividends actually grow at a rate much faster than my earnings and I discount them back at 23 percent the value per share that I get is this 40 there's nothing no need to add cash no need to subtract our debt now you can see why people like the dividend discount model it's clean you take the present value you're done and you're factoring in what you actually see being paid in the company but implicitly I am assuming that CIB is paying out what it can afford to pay out that the regulatory authorities in Egypt are watching over to make sure it's not doing something incredibly scary or risky Undercover and that's always the risk you're exposed to with banks because you have you're saying why don't I do my own due diligence how are you going to do that in the back you can't get access to their loan portfolio and check through every loan says that loan going to pay off or not you just have to take the word that they've set aside five percent for bad debt and that's actually an adequate number but without that regulatory overlay you're kind of exposed any questions in a different discount model so here's the first thing I want to emphasize with banks and something I've kind of talked around the first is that by definition banks are opaque they're difficult to understand I mean you see now in hindsight people look at Silicon Valley Bank and say I knew it was coming and you could probably at least at svb have figured it out based on the bond holding but in most banks if you're promised with loans you always learn after the fact getting cash flows is difficult the things that you take for granted that you can find in a regular company are much more difficult to find at a bank second that will then translate into numbers that might skip a picture that that that might not you might ignore the regular companies with the bank matters more remember when we valued regular companies how little we talked about Book value the only time we talked about book values in Computing return Equity return versus Capital because to be quite honest who cares what the book value of equity is it a Microsoft or an apple or any other company or any non-financial service company you know that one in nine U.S companies now has negative Book value of equity that'll freak accountants out but frankly I don't care you know how you end up with negative Book value of equity you start with a positive number and then you slide you lose money you keep losing money you take a big charge your book Banks Book value of equity actually has mean why you know banks are regulated and one of the ways they Regulators are required to keep regulatory Capital there are this whole layer if you ever want to put yourself to sleep pick up this book on basil rules and Banks and read it and fall asleep and read it a little more but eventually when you get through it it's about regulatory Capital requirements tier one tier two basically but the one commonality is Book value of equity is the building block for all of those I'll tell you the intuition here all of those regulatory Capital requirements are designed to make sure that banks have enough equity that when a shock hits they're able to cover the shock and keep going why because you've got to protect the depositors because Regulators screw up but book equities so with the bank I actually have to keep my own book equity and to the extent that I need to that I fall short I've got to bring in fresh Equity to increase my regular that's what svb was trying to do and it triggered the Panic right and that gave me an opening to think about an alternative difference because I'll tell you after 2008 I remember in 2019 I wrote a series of papers which I call my doomsday papers like what if nothing is risk-free what if nothing is liquid basically I want to think through what would happen in a world where nothing was risk-free nothing was Liquid because I wanted to live out my nightmare because then the actualities would never be as bad right if you thought through the worst case scenario this can't be that bad and one of the things I thought about was what if you don't trust regulatory authorities in Banks and what if banks are run by senseless people so I said I need to come up with a measure what a bank can actually pay out a free cash flow Equity we do this with regular companies but the traditional way of working to Free Cash Road Equity is not going to get me there because I can't get capex I can't get depreciation to work so I rethought what reinvestment in a band cast and here's why here's the way I thought through it and you tell me where there's a flaw in my reason for a bank to survive it's got to have it's got to meet the regulatory Capital requirements so if I'm a growing Bank I've got to grow my regulatory Capital to keep up with it otherwise the regulatory authorities if I'm a bank that has a big loss or I do something bad in my regulatory Capital drops I have to come up with the extra regulatory capital to get back to where I need to be for a bank the equivalent of capex depreciation working capital is that reinvestment in regulatory Capital that I will need to make to grow so growing banks will need more reinvestment than mature Banks Banks in trouble will need more reinvestment than banks that are healthy what that's going to allow me to do is compute my free cash load equities net income minus that reinvestment in regulatory capital I've now escaped from the tyranny of the dividend discount model I'm no longer dependent the bank telling me what it can pay out I can estimate my free cash reduction so I'm going to try the bank that I picked is one of the two banks that I describe as characters in a horror movie you've seen horror movies usually there's a teenage I don't know this it's very sexy it's usually a teenage girl but sometimes a teenage boy they're in a dark house there's no power they come up to a basement door they can hear the sound of a chainsaw in the basement that's your question it's a dark house there's no light there's this chainsaw in the basement what should any sensible human being do just get the damn hell out of that house but that's not what they do they open the door and they go down into the basement and then blood spurts out of the basement Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse I like those characters since 2008 every year they go down the basement blood gore they come back out they go back down again and again and again credit tweets at least the pain is over but Deutsche the pain continues limbs are gone but they're still going down so this was evaluation I did of Deutsche in October of 2016. and it was not a good time so here's what had happened Deutsche had like three years of big losses and every time you have losses remember your book equities dropping a regulatory capital is dropping and in addition the Department of Justice the U.S Department of Justice had just fined Deutsche 10 billion dollars for something they did in 2008. why did it take them so long the wheels of Justice work slowly whatever you want to say it takes forever but basically eight years later so a bunch of pain is coming together at the same time you've got these losses you got this big big fine their book Equity had dropped to 12.41 so the tier one Capital ratio basically measures how much they have how do I know that's high or low you know that number you can get it from Capital like you can get that for every back so I actually pulled that for every bag to see where they fell they fell in like the 10th percentile that tier one Capital ratio had become way too low and given that risk as this bank with investment banking at risky arms they should really be around 50 at about a 15.67 they're under capitalized as a bank but to make things worse they were losing a ton of money they had lost eight billion dollars eight billion euros the previous year they were expected to continue to lose money so here's what I decided to do value Deutsche I dividend discount model is not even going to be in the Horizon it's not going to work it's a money losing bank with you know with no dividends so I projected out what I expect would happen to the return in equity over time I assume that over time the return on equity which is negative right now would Converge on 9.4 that sounds no it looks awfully precise 9.44 that happens to be the cost of equity in your debt so here's my good State scenario they will dig themselves out of the hole to the point where they can earn their cost effectively but as the return Equity goes from negative to positive the losses become profit so I have my expected net income ever next I said they've got to get the regulatory Capital ratio fixed and they've got to do it soon because there was talk in 2016. of Deutsche being taken effectively into receivership what does that mean you never liquidate a bank it does make sense you have all these depositors you find somebody else to essentially take it over your Equity will often get wiped out in the process but you get a fresh start that's what's happening at Credit Suisse you probably read the news story this morning Silicon Valley Bank you know it's being you know it's potentially going to get bought out why because it's it's not like any other company we liquidate deposits get returned so essentially but if you do that your Equity is going to be worth nothing so they have to do something for us so over time I assume that they would have to improve their regulatory Corporation so here's what's what what the end effect is if you take that regulatory Capital ratio improving over time that must mean that means they have to have more money invested in regulatory Capital leadership if you take the change from where they are now they have to invest about 6.6 billion dollars in regulatory Capital next year let me take your one they have a big loss they've got to come up with 6.6 billion regulatory Capital add the numbers up they're free cash load Equity is minus 11.7 billion you're saying what does that mean based on my projections Deutsche will have to have raised 11.7 in New Equity next year in fact they have to keep raising equity for the next four years to dig themselves out this is the advantage of a free cash flow to equity model if you have an undercapitalized Bank you can factor in the expected dilution you will face because that bank will have to raise fresh equity eventually the free cash flows Equity turned positive and you take the present value the free cash flows you end up with a value per share of about twenty three dollars but there is a chance that one more shock could push them over the edge you see how quickly Credit Suisse went from Health to death right basically spin out of control I would that's only a 10 chance because this was a good time most banks were in were healthy but if you're an environment where banks are getting into trouble this is the number that's going to jump up because a bank that looks healthy where there's a 30 chance of getting into debt spiral it's going to be worth less than a bank without that yet has a 10 chance I assume zero value for My Equity if that happened my expected value per share was 2067. stock price is 1333 ask me the question I actually bought it and I got incredibly lucky purely by luck because a year later they made um a rights issue you know what a rights issue is rights issue is basically everybody who owns shares new companies allowed to buy an additional share at half the current stock price they made a rights issue to raise about 10 billion dollars which didn't surprise me I cashed out during the rights issue not because I had foresight but because I remember my horror movie there's another horror scene coming in where to face it but on Monday I will complete the story and talk a little bit more about valuing Banks because some of you are but I've um foreign 
foreign by now by now you know the routine right the quizzes will get sorted in alphabetical order okay so foreign fifth grade she used to teach second grade and what that's right is that what it is I don't I don't want to hold up the wrong fingers you're not leading me down the wrong way right okay whatever it is is that what it is okay okay my wife teaches fifth grade and last week and we talk about teaching all the time with each other and she was talking about the fifth graders folks settle in place so she was talking about a fifth graders she was complaining about the fact that when she gave exams people did not follow the rules and I almost told it because at 10 years old and then I remembered what happens every time I give a question what do I say when it's 30 minutes up I say stop working right but every time I do this I did this my mbas they're grown-ups that extra two minutes they think is going to make the difference it never does it never does but you feel the urge to do it so please please please on the next Quiz when I say time is up just stop that's it's not fair it's right uh I don't want to talk about the question but what's going to happen in the quizzes are going to get alphabetically sorted hopefully while we teach or while I teach and the class is over I did give all three of my classes quizzes today so it's my big quiz day I had a corporate finance class 200 people in the morning at my MBA class 150 students just from 1 30 to 3 now there's I use a first in first out policy when it comes to grading so I would grade the corporate finance class first and then the MBA interview so I'm not picking on you because you're undergraduate you're just last in line because you took the exam late and as I finish each one I will send you an email saying it's done come pick it up and it'll be in alphabetical order face down right so don't worry it's it's done my corporate finance class we talk about the notion of sunk cost you know what that is right once it's happened just let it go okay it's talking about it is not going to change it thinking about it is not going to change it not picking up your quiz is not going to change it but it does badly maybe it's your freebie you've done badly on the first two quizzes one of them has to be a free being and I'll decide which one be the lower score okay just let it go second I got about 400 of your DCFS back over the weekend collectively there are 500 people in the class which means there are about a hundred of you who have not turned in your DCF I'm not saying this because I love looking at DCFS I don't want to look at another DCF for the next whatever but if you are one of those hundred who hasn't turned in your ECF for feedback I know I told you by this week and do it but I you know if you really get done by Wednesday or Thursday or Friday and you say I'd love some feedback send it to me if I'm in a good mood I'll send it back to you if I'm in a bad mood I bury it but either way I would respond to you but try to work on that as well I mean those of you completed that's a big part of the project so if you've done it seventy percent of the project is done there's still pricing to be done but this was the big part of your project and I wanted to make sure you got it done before we got a table so mission accomplished at least with 400 of you so today I want to wrap up the last few parts of intrinsic valuation remember in the last session we value Deutsche Bank and the reason we did not use dividend discount model was that it doesn't fit right it's a money losing bank you worry about regulatory oversight and what did we do we took we projected our net income and we estimated the variation of reinvestment for a bank which is how much do you have to invest in regulatory capital so if you're a non-decapitalized bank you will need to reinvest more your your Equity be worthless your free cash flow Equity would reflective in fact if you're under capitalized enough you know what's going to happen right the free cash flow Equity will be negative which means you're going to be having to issue new shares which will reduce the value of Macbook so essentially we're bringing in what we do with traditional companies tibets now I know I've kind of bundled together financial service companies into this big amalgam as if they're all similar so somebody help me out I'm going to go back to basics okay what makes a with a with the software company we can talk about what makes a software company special hi you know great software proprietary software High margins if you're looking at a bank a Traditional Bank what sets apart Great Banks from good Banks good Banks from average Banks average Banks from Bad Banks what is it that Banks do that creates that what is an old-fashioned Bank it takes a deposits it loans them up right so how do you create excess returns first is if a lot of your deposits are demand deposits you're paying nothing on the deposits so it's like free money and you lend it out no you're making money but let's say you're in a mark in a world where that's getting more and more difficult to do and in the US let's start to get more difficult in 1979. so what happened in 1979 Merrill Lynch introduced the very first money market account and it changed the Dynamics of how people kept cash because under the 1970s if you were an individual you had a lot of cash you want to keep it under a mattress you had to put in a bag you know what banks beta's interest zero they gave you a toaster you got lots of toasters I don't know but basically they said you hope you're putting a million dollars we'll give you a nice toaster yeah I'll take the toaster but it's really not making up for the interest I'm losing on money market accounts what do any marketer constant Maryland basically took your money invested in tables they took a slice so basically they were doing this for charity but instead of making nothing you're now making seven and what drove it people rates it risen to 13 people are finally saying this is crazy why am I keeping my money in the bank and making zero percent so it made that easy source of money making difficult so let's start at the loan side what separates good Banks from bad Banks can I just look at the interest rate to charge on your loans and say banks that charge that make more interest on their loans are better than banks that earn less interest why or why not so let's say you have two bags Bank a makes 11 interest rate on its launch it's loaded at 11 the second bank has loaned out the money at eight percent can I say the 11 bank is better than the eight percent yeah sure why not that could but there's another thing who am I learning the money to exactly right it's if I pick bad credit companies and lend it 11 I might be charging too low rate and if I've saved companies so when you look at Banks you're looking at not just what are you charging an interest but how well are you interesting default risk in your companies and making sure you earn a rate of return higher than what you need so good bank tries to get a lot of deposits at low rates and tries to make loans at rates that are higher than what you should really be charging on a market basis that is so unfair life is unfair and 40 years ago if you wanted to borrow money especially outside the US what were your choices a bank or a money lender a money lender would charge you more a bank or a bank what changed the Dynamics on that issue what what can so let's say you are a mid-sized company now the bank is charging you more than what you should be paying on a market interest rate basis because they want to make money what are your choices now that you might not have had 30 or 40 years ago you can issue corporate Bonds in the 1960s and 70s or prior to the 1980s only big companies issued corporate bonds only investment grade companies issued corporate bonds Mike Milken and Drexel burn have changed the Dynamics in the second one you could be a double b rate company in issue bonds and small companies in mid-sized companies you see how banks are getting squeezed on the one hand the deposit business is getting more difficult because these money market funds and the marriages of the world are taking away the Easy Money on the other side you would like to charge more than the market interest rate but that business is getting really more difficult because companies now have a choice of going to corporate department and this has been going on a while so what did some banks decide to do because the banking business was getting more difficult in Investment Banking and trading and real estate and hence was born the money center back it's not easy money but it looks like it's easier money than working it's getting I mean basically what I'm saying is the banking business has become more difficult as a business over the last 50 years because on both sides of the balance sheet it's getting charged and now you have in the last decade A new challenge I mean every bank has some easy money they make I talked about how JPMorgan charges me 45 dollars for moving my money from my bank account to my bank account in JPMorgan so why are you doing that because we can and thanks to all these things where you Nick they nickel and dime you but the nickels and dimes add up to lots of dollars and in many ways that's what fintech is going after it's not going after the loan business it's a terrible business to be in it's going after the easy money that banks are making so if you look at how easy it is to move money off the banking system I mean when I want to send money to my kids and it's always me sending money not them sending me money I don't know why that works even though they're grown up oh you spend more I mean why would I go through a bank and pay a 25 wire charge I use so essentially the mechanism that fintech is creating is taking the easy money away so banking as a business is essentially getting squeezed doesn't mean it's a bad business but these crises sometimes obscure so the good times the bad times obscure the fact that banking is a business is getting more difficult so banking is one kind of financial service business let's take insurance companies what makes an insurance company a good insurance company a great insurance company an average one what are the things you would look at sir how do insurance companies make money and they but basically if you boil it down to basically sell US policies against uh you know losing our lives losing our property and they collect premiums so what drives whether you're successful is whether you're making the assessments of probabilities correct right you're very dependent on those Actuarial tables something right you know that big data was born in Lawyers Insurance it was started in the 1400s and the 1500s essentially to ensure ships those days you think about big business in the in in in England get a ship owner would buy a ship and it send it off to get spices in the Far East and remember this was when you had to go Around the Horn of Africa to get from so after six they were either destroyed in storms or Pirates took them huge amount of risk and the insurance business was born to kind of protect against the truth they charge Hefty premiums but they basically said we'll insure 100 ships and we're right about estimating what percent of these ships will not make it back and then we charge a premium on that I mean so you look at good insurance companies and not how much you're growing your premiums but are you charging enough of a premium to cover the expected payouts that are going to come from this insurance and of course if you're lucky and you have a very good portfolio manager a great portfolio magic you get an added bonus right that's a Berkshire Hathaway thing you take the Geico money and you have a great portfolio manager you get that additional source of value very unusual at an insurance company how about a Payment Processing Company you know you know so let's take a classic Payment Processing Company payment processing companies are let's go old-fashioned MasterCard Visa how does that business model work how does how do they make money first is they every time a transaction happens on their platform they take a slice of it so when you use your MasterCard to pay for dinner and you pay a hundred dollars I'm assuming you go for expensive dinners right the merchant doesn't receive the hundred dollars he receives 97 or 97.50 the typical that's called the pay grade saving a credit card company what drives your value how many transactions or what the dollar value of transactions is on your platform and then what pay credit you have on it historically American Express has a much higher take rate than MasterCard of Visa which is one reason fewer Merchants except American Express because when you use the American Express to pay for exactly the same item the merchant ends up with 96 dollars rather than 97.50 and he says I I don't want that but they're credit card companies right so what's a second business to give you a twenty dollar minimum payback you have a two thousand dollar credit card thing so basically they're loaning you one thousand that's very nice of them right but how much do you pay on your credit card you don't even want to look it's like what they they do constrain them you can't charge money lender rates or you know extortionist rates but it's like 24 percent you carry a credit card loan you're carrying some of the most expensive debt you can think of because it's easy money well not necessarily because you're carrying a large credit card balance odds are you're also a high credit risk there's going to be a bunch of bankruptcy so it's not like they make a ton of money in fact collectively if you look at how much credit card companies make on those the money it's surprisingly small after you adjust for the bad debts and the other stuff that they have to go through so when you think about financial service companies one thing I would suggest you do is set back and say how does this Financial Service Company make money and when you want to build a valuation you've got to build it around those metrics so I'm going to take an example of a Financial Service Company very different from Deutsche it's a company called ATM for the paytm Payment Processing Company it's an Indian online Payment Processing Company a young company a growth company right public a couple of years ago and I value the time for its IPL so paytm is is basically a phone app and every time you use paytm as your platform to buy things they keep a small percentage they take rate so it's like the credit card model so when I fit their company says we create the business that's never been done before that's not true it's been done before by somebody else it's in a slightly different version so in a valid paytm here's what I did I started with a basic question which is you know to drive if you think about what drives the value of all of these payment processing companies the first is how much goes on the platform called gross merchandising value it's GMB but it's just a fancy buzzword for how much do people spend on your platform so MasterCard is DMV and remember the gross merchandise value is not your Revenue it's the three percent or two percent or one and a half percent and paytm had some eye-popping numbers when it went public the most eye-popping number at paytm was the fact that 330 million people on the platform so one thing about Indian and Chinese companies that blows the minds of non of European U.S investors 330 million people that's more than the entire population of Europe right there on your plan this is good right so and I valued them I took the 330 million plus the people on the platform I looked at the gross merchandise value flowing through and there was a little problem in paytm's business model which is they were letting people transact essentially for almost no fee why because I wanted more users I remember at the time I valued paytm I downloaded their app onto my phone I regretted it every second afterwards I mean this is an Indian pavement process every day I would get 12 more notifications on free things they were going to give me but I kept it on because I wanted to see how much their model was driven by trying to get new users trying to get free stuff and the way this shows up is you look at that take rate it's 0.79 that's minuscule remember what I said it's from for MasterCard it's like two and a half to three percent for PayPal it's around 3.2 percent for American Express it's four percent point seven nine percent and I cut them some slack and I said they're growing they're trying to get users on the platform they're giving away stuff for free and I made my fatal mistake I assumed that now that they've gone public and they got the cash they would focus on the next step which is to do what you got the users what should you be doing if you're a sensible business people you should be working on monetizing the users a fancy word for hey now I need to make money of these users sounds incredibly Mercantile but that's the whole point of having users in your platform that was a fatal mistake because it turns out that the people running this business are incapable of building a business you think how did they get a company they're great at attracting users and for a decade they were reward it for that basis right in what way Venture capitalists paid based on how many users you had so they were encouraged to build business models but you got the 330 million users mission accomplished if that is your mission but it's really not your mission you know what they take rate for paytm is right now 0.75 percent they've got more users though they've added another 35 million users this is a trade going nowhere or actually it's going to the wrong place we don't want to talk about the destination here but the stock I valued paypm at 2000 rupees assuming that over time they would improve their take rate not to some PayPal level but to a lower number and the reason it's going to be lower in India is because the Indian government started its own online you know money transferring system called UTI which is free essentially it means that the some of the easy money is gone so it's going to keep the take rate slower but two percent even though it's much lower than the US what I thought was a reachable take rate you know the stock is trading it now I valued the 2190 rupees it's trading at about 600 rupees per share massively undervalued but not as long as these guys run it I should do a revaluation of paytm because I get whenever I value company because it's on my blog people keep reminding me that I'm wrong you know look how wrong you would look it doesn't bother me in the lead because I'm wrong so often no but I need to revisit this and you know what I'm going to do differently I'm going to leave the take rate at 0.79 say these guys have no idea how to make money but they can keep building users and if I leave the Day created 0.79 and increase the growth rate to 50 you know what my value is going to be about 600 rupees the market seems to have built in this presumption that these are user Builders not business Builders and I could say the same thing about half the tech companies that came out of nowhere last year over the last decade because Venture capitalists rewarded companies for doing what scale up I remember when the first the first bird bikes showed up you know the ones that you know you rent for an hour and you drop off wherever you want and I remember looking at the business and this is the stupidest business I've ever seen how the heck are you going to make money on this because you know in San Diego where I live I can tell you exactly what happened to twenty percent of bikes teenagers After High School would come and throw bikes off cliffs into the ocean terrible ecological thing to do but from a business standpoint there goes one they go 150 bikes there's there was no and I remember talking to somebody VC investing so why do you do it and he said Big Data I said what because when you heard the word big date it means I haven't thought of a good reason yet so I'll throw Big Data out there so what big data that we know when people get on the bike we know when people get up we know where you are let's say you think you're special I showed them my iPhone there are 27 apps tracking me right now check your phone there are probably at least 20 apps you know why you let them track you right because if you let them track you it makes your life easier if you don't let Google Maps track you you can't use the GPS and you said should I buy a Garmin GPS you should let Google Maps right I'll let Google Maps track everybody knows where I'm anywhere you're not special there's no big data here the bottom line was it was a company built on a terrible business model but nobody cared as long as you got more users more cities and people paid a higher price for having more users why would you have a bottom so as you look at some of these companies implored because they can't figure out how to make money the answer is because they backed at scaling it so if you want to you know take the paytm and upgrade it to reflect a management that will never make money do so yep well that's because if your margins improve from 0.7 but if you take rate goes from 0.75 to 2 percent you're going to get a huge marginal return and invest Capital because the jump in earnings is coming from margins approving so any of your value companies or your margins improve over time when you look at the return on Capital because I compute it for you and said this is what your return on capital is between yours it's coming from your margins improving margin Improvement is like three months right because you don't have to invest the capital once your margins start to level off is when you look at your return on Capital now does it make sense so that's what the Improvement is coming from is the doubling of the take rate over the next five or six years is pushing up the operating income it's actually making go from negative to positive without much need for investment because you've got 330 million users already you don't need to invest very much you've done your work of building up the platform now try to monetize it should be this is actually the part of business where you start to make money but it seems to be one that they don't quantity of so now let's talk about LA and this is my last Dark Side evaluation valuing companies with intangible assets I'll be quite honest I don't like the word intangible because in accounting the word intangibles created so you can have two sets of root tangible assets intense blasts step back in intrinsic valuation what drives the value of energy cash flows growth and risk right does it matter it's physical assets or no we don't care if I have a patent and I give you cash flows in the next five years and the risk you can value the patent if I gave you a factory and I gave you the same five cash flows you do exactly the same thing we don't treat assets differently depending on whether we can see them or not see them but accountants do and that problem carries over into accounting the problem in value companies with intangible assets are substantially intangible assets pharmaceutical companies Consulting companies is the accounting screwed up we've talked about this right screwed up in what sense when I ask you what are your cash flows of existing assets and you show me your income statement your statement of cash flows and your balance sheet with the pharmaceutical company I'm getting job credit because what did you do you took the r d expense and treat as an operating space that earnings is really not the earnings from existing assets so what did I have to do to get this fixed I had to capitalize the r d it's not that it's difficult value but the raw data you're given now requires work same thing when I ask you what's the value of growth if I don't correct priority capitalization I get this incredibly High return on Capital not because you take great projects but because I haven't brought your biggest Assets in the books every single question the problem I ran into is the fact that accounting because of its inconsistencies has made my life more difficult so here's what I'd like to do I'd like to talk a little bit about why we clean up those inconsistencies I know this is way back in the class we talked about capitalizing r d and recruiting and training expenses I know it's a little late but I want to give you the rationale for why I spent the time that I did going through that process when I capitalize r d then since you're coming off in second quiz you should be able to answer this what effect do I have on free cash flow to the firm last year all I do is move things around right I change my earnings I change my reinvestment when I capitalize r d the effect is not on the free cash for the firm it's in my perception of the quality of the company's project the return on Capital the reinvestment rate so I I'm going to take a company and I'm going to take you through the process of what happens when I capitalize Rd in fact those of you capitalize r d on my spreadsheet you can very easily run this experiment too all you need to do is check take the s for the r d make it no see what happens to your value per share so you can see and I'm going to tell you what that difference tells you about your company so this is a company that most of you are familiar with it's a company called amcha but 15 years ago it's a big biotechnology company really a pharmaceutical company in terms of where it is in the life cycle so in the in the second column you see my valuation where I trusted the accountants I took their operating income their invested Capital so I did my entire evaluation with the existing accounting statements the value per share that I got was 42.73 then I checked off that box for r d I entered the r d numbers for amjet and it had consequences first my operating income jumped from 5.07 billion to 7.3 billion why because I've capitalized r d it changes my operating income my invested Capital jump 8 billion because now I'm bringing in all that capitalized r d something very unusual happened in the case of Amgen usually when you capitalize r d your return in capital goes down here it actually increased because the effect on operating income is actually higher than the effect of my invested Capital but here's the bottom line with my numbers now reflecting r d as a capital expense the value per share that I got was 74.33 I'm almost doubled the value of the company right this sounds like a great way to just push up the value big company right but just to show you that this is not a rule I actually valued Merck at the same time another big pharmaceutical company and did exactly the same thing there I got a value of forty dollars per share with the accounting numbers when I capitalize r d the value per share actually dropped from 40 to 30. so what am I learning about Amgen and Merck when I do these valuations am I learning anything about the quality of r d investments in these two companies we make some judgments here I mean is already good for a company a bad for a company depends right depends on what depends on like any other investment does it increase your earnings in the case of I am gen you know what's happening when I capitalize r d it's turning out to be a net plus for the company suggesting that when Amgen puts money in r d it's not guaranteed but they're getting higher earnings and higher cash flows at more than compensate for the fact that I'm now trading r d as a capex but at least an engine R D's value created what do I find out for Mark they're spending billions of dollars in r d and nothing is happening to their earnings and I'm saying guys stop doing r d set the whole department away yo back I know this sounds you know extreme but r d by itself is neither good nor bad it can create value to destroy value capitalizing r d is going to give you so try that out with any of you have used r d Capital has already turn it off see what happens if value per share you're getting a very quick indicator of whether r d is value creating a value destroyed yeah I gave them 10 years if they aren't if and remember this is cumulative already I you know at some point you got to say this is the definition of insanity is you keep doing the same thing over and over expecting a different outcome and nothing changes the case of mercam um that gave them two years you can complain ten years nothing's happened something's wrong with your r d ude and finally let's talk about commodity competition you know what the the most significant feature that you run into and you value an oil company or cyclical companies I mean let's take a big Oil Company a mature Oil Company Royal Dutch Exxon Mobil aramco when you usually think of mature companies what do you think in terms of earnings earnings are relatively stable right you know what our Ram course earnings did between 2020 and 2021 they were up 40 between 2021 and 2022 they were down 15 you do the same thing with Royal Dutch and Exxon Mobil these are mature companies here why is that it's all the prices right it's not that iranco produces more oil or less oil or every same thing with cyclical companies you take a mature cyclical company you look at a recession their earnings are going to collapse not because they're bad companies but because it's simple every question I ask you will that depend on a macro variable so and ask you what are your cash flows of existing assets and oil prices are a hundred dollars a barrel you show them your numbers everything looks great making a ton of money ask you what's the value of growth amazing everything it creates success returns you take the same company a year later when oil pressure third and you ask them exactly the same question every question you get a different answer and finally with especially with the commodity companies the question is can you ever use a perpetuity you see why that's kind of inconsistent there's only so much oil so much gold in the ground you're going to run out of it eventually so maybe this is one of those scenarios you might say look I'll use a finite period That's why foreign the first obvious conclusion which is with these companies the story you tell has a very strong macro component right so when you look at Royal Dutch or Exxon Mobil or any oil company the story is a big macro company it's lurking in the background and you're going to feel the urge to play macro forecaster and my advice to you is please don't you know what I mean by macro forecast would you sit down to Value an oil company what do you feel the urge to do everything depends on oil prices I'm going to forecast oil prices let me play along do you have a strong view on oil prices you're going to go up so you know so let's say you build in a doubling of the oil prices over the next five years I'm going to save you the trouble value any oil company what are you going to find basically you're going to find every Oil Company cheap and then I'm going to ask you did you find Royal Dutch to be cheap because you like the company or because you think oil price will double over the next five years if you think it's a ladder you know what I'm going to ask you to do stop valuing the properties if you're that good at forecasting oil prices what should you do instead what's an easier way to make money go buy oil Futures if you're a really great macro forecaster why are you wasting your time selling individual companies just go do some forecasting the only problem is a good macro forecaster is an oxymoron you could be a macro forecaster but you're definitely not good if you're good you don't try macro forecasting you think but what about all those oil price forecasting Services they exist to make suit stairs look good the horrifically bad at forecasting they do it because it's their job so if you're really good at forecasting my hat's off to you but don't waste your time valuing confidence because when you bring in your macro views into your evaluation of a company you know the problem you create for me you create this joint effect I don't know how much you like the company and how much the macro variables are driving so if you're really good at macro forecasting my advice is do your valuation with a macro neutral view don't bring in a view give me a value of the company you're telling me is this company good or bad then give me a macro forecast because then I can decide whether to buy oil futures or an oil ETF separate the two because you mix them up I don't know where one stops and the other pickets and this is one of the few places or one of the places where I think using probabilistic tools now I want to talk a little bit about simulations and how they can help you can I think let you get your hands around that macro area so I'm going to give you an example of an oil company valuation and how using a simulation made me feel more comfortable company called royaltouch it's been around 150 years one of the original oil companies that developed all results in the first place mature oil company nobody quite knows whether it's a Dutch company or a UK company it's like two personalities but it's an old organic so this was about five years or the seven years winner 2016. I had I did a valuation of Royal Dutch for the Royal Dutch Finance group in Houston now remember what I said to Value company you want to be macro neutral what does that mean in a value in oil company I don't want to make assumptions about where oil prices go so I'm going to use today's oil pressure base I can use all Futures prices they're market prices but remember oil Futures prices are not predicted prices because Arbitrage binds them to the spot price you know what I mean by that no because I can always buy the oil store it and deliver it a year from now so you look at Futures prices and all and they're always very closely connected to the spot right so when one goes down everything else will go down so you can just switches prices so I want you to be macro neutral and I ran into a bit of a problem right from the beginning at the time that I valued Royal Dutch in 2016 the oil price had dropped had dropped to forty dollars a barrel and the reason I paid that it had been seventy dollars in the year before it dropped to 40 so you see why this is going to create a promise when you valued a company what did you look at the trailing 12 month numbers right if oil prices average seventy dollars over the last 12 months and I take the trailing 12 month numbers and the oil price now is forty dollars I'm almost guaranteed to overvalue the company why because I've taken numbers that reflect the 70 oil price and I replaced it I'll put it into evaluation with the oil prices forty dollars is there a way I could estimate how much revenue Royal Dutch would have if oil price so 41st give me direction if all price of forty dollars a barrel should the revenues be lower than what you see in the trading government numbers are higher should be much lower right and here you get lucky especially with a mature oil company I went back and collected revenues at Royal Dutch every year going back this is the advantage of having a company that's been around forever I can get revenues every year so that's a column it's the Brown Line That's the average oil price everywhere did together oh it looks like they're in lockstep in fact just to confirm that my eyes weren't lying I computed the r squared about what this tells you 96 percent of the variation in Royal Dutch's revenues on a year-to-year basis comes from the oil price I remember asking the finance group at Royal Dutch or they asked me and said do you know who the CEO of Royal taxes and I said I don't know and I don't care what's he going to do anyway come look at the oil price terminal a little more carefully this is an oil in fact you could probably run the company with Tesla Bots running the company roughly at the same revenues as with the existing management team right the Bots are probably going to be more rational because they look at the price react directly to it rather than play bankrolls okay so what is this regression also allow me to do I ran a regression of revenues against the oil press if I plug in a 40 oil press into this you know what I'm going to get I'm going to get the revenues that Royal Dutch would have had at a 40 price that's what I used as my base revenues to Value Royal Dutch so I'm going to close with the picture because this is what I meant by simulation in this valuation what's the one variable that's keeping me up at night if anything keeps you up at night it's not now what the exploration is what's the oil price so I built a distribution of oil prices which is easy to do it's a traded and then I ran a simulation what do you do in a simulation you go pick a price out of the out of the distribution let's say the first price you pick is 55 you value Royal debt to the 55 price you come up with the van probably much higher than the 39 I got and I do this over and over again I used a program that all of you have access to as NYU students called Crystal Ball it's an add-on to Excel and in fact if any of you want to convert your DCF valuations into simulations please don't send them back to feedback with the simulation I would trust you now you can add crystal ball it just adds an extra column you can make those inputs under Revenue growth margins and sales to Capital all into distributions you see what we're doing right we're replacing a point estimate with a distribution what you get as output is basically a distribution of value not a single value and there's the the the table that I almost always also developed the actual oil pre the actual price of royal touch was 42 dollars per share take a look at the distribution what does it tell me 42 dollars puts me at roughly the 62nd percentile so what can I say 62 there's a 62 chance that royal touch is overvalued 38 chance you turn to that think of how much richer your decision making is instead of just giving your value I gave you a distribution of that if you want to try it out you know I mean it's free might as well try it out because once you graduate you got to pay for the program it's an oracle product it's well worth it I think if you're in finance or in any area of business but there's uncertainty the learning curve is you know almost non-existent it's very easy to use the statistics learning curve is a little steeper because let's face it most of you have asked you what's your only distribution you remember from statistics it is the normal distribution so to do some homework on the rest of the distributions but I would see you on Wednesday but before that you should hear about your quizzes foreign yes the question about 
nope thank you I don't know house okay folks uh did you get a chance to pick up your quizzes I'll lead them out till Friday night Friday night and bring them in and then I still have probably a hundred quiz once I don't know what you think is going to happen to them but they just sit there until the night I think two weeks after the semester is done I throw them all into recycling otherwise my I'll be drowned in places so I don't care if you pick them up or not but I'd suggest you pick them up because I'm not the pope I'm not infallible I screw up on my grading and it's in your best interest to check to see that especially those quizzes I graded around 11 45 at night God only knows what I was you know what I was even on at that point in time now is there always even a wake up asleep so I you know if I if I messed up here's all you need to do don't make up elaborate emails on what you did take a picture of the page where you think I've screwed up tell me where you think I've screwed up and I will add the points on if it looks like you you have something you know that you that I really miss something or if not I'll tell you now that's not going to fly so that's all you need to do so nothing needed no off you know you don't have to come in and make a case there's no case to make you know I either missed something or I did not mess up So today we're going to talk about pricing very different it's almost a mindset shift you're going to start to see the shift happen during the course of the day so let's start off with something that I'm going to back up today much of what you see out there because you worked as an intern whether you go to work for a bank much of what you see describe this valuation is really pricey people like to do pricing for whatever reason and one of the reasons that many analysts give for why they like to use PE ratios and comparables and not use a discard cash flow model is they say look you make a lot of assumptions when you do a discounted cash flow evaluation do you think about that DCF you turn in right or something about growth and margins and reinvestment and part of you screaming I have no idea but you had to do it anywhere think how much easier it is to attach a number to a company by saying hey the p e ratio for other companies in the sector is 20 I'm going to multiply the earnings per share by 20 and there's my price in other words it doesn't look like you're making assumptions about cash flows growth and risk is that true though that when you use a PE ratio you're not why not [Music] yeah it's like Risk in fact you're making assumptions about cash flows growth and risk you are making exact same assumptions you did in your DC F but you're making them implicit you think so what let's say making an implicit Assumption of 80 growth in your revenues of attacks wouldn't you want to test that assumption at least with an intrinsic valuation when you make up a really crazy number you know you've made it up you worry about it with pricing you don't even think about so one of the things I'm going to talk about today is to take um a multiple and back out from it the assumptions about cash flows growth and risk where I'm almost reverse engineering so we can ask what are those implicit assumptions let's make them explicit second how many of you liked your statistics class you had to take statistics right to get your when was that first year second year question what's the objective of Statistics why do we take statistics I know it's because required you see what do you mean why is it I would never have taken if it wasn't required class but if you get past the required part what is the end game in statistics what is it going to help us do in other words it allows us to make sense of large and contradictory data both pieces need to be in place right if you have only five observations you don't need statistics you can eyeball the data if all of the data points in the same direction you don't need statistics because it's all pointing in the same direction it's because you have large and contradictory data and statistics helps you make emphasis do you have large and contradictory data in markets this is the motherlode of large and contradictory data if I taught a statistics class and thank God I don't but if I did I would build it entirely around price earnings ratios and companies across and making it about statistics because this is Big Data before Big Data became a buzzword right this financial markets is where they're large and contradictory data but in statistics unfortunately you leave the class selective Amnesia kicks in and everything you learned during the class somehow gets wiped out especially when you talk about distribution the only distribution you end up remembering is the normal distribution because you say you know I'm normal I'll pick the normal distribution but whatever the reasoning is and what's the nice thing about the normal distribution why do we so love the normal distribution what is it about the normal distribution that makes it so easy to work with it can be described with two parameters what are the two parameters the mean and the standard deviation when I go to complicated distributions I need four parameters five parameters so it's nice to work with normal distributions can a p e ratio let's say you compute the p ratio for every company in the market you put up a distribution the way you do this is to do what's called a histogram remember those from statistics you count the number of companies be ratio zero to four four to eight and you put it in a can p ratios be normally distributed go back to normal distribution what's uh what's low in the high value in a normal distribution goes from minus infinity to plus infinity right what's the lowest value of PE ratio can take zero why because when earnings turn negative the PE Ratio becomes not meaningful and not available so the lowest value you can get is zero what's the highest value of p ratio could take you don't see Infinity but it can be really high you know what the highest p ratio Among Us stocks was started 2023 eighty six thousand four hundred I think that must be one highly priced stock right it's reading about eight dollars per share but the earnings per share dropped to a fraction of a cent position the verge of going negative the p e ratio become explosive they may say who cares that's inside Statistics no about you but I remember what my statistics Professor told us and he talked about this it's called an asymmetric distribution it's got a right tail but no left there right zero potential he said don't trust the arch why not what's wrong with with the average when you have an asymmetric distribution what's going to happen to it it's going to get secured which direction too high or too low too high because all your outliers are big positive numbers there's nothing to offset on the other side now do you see why we should care about statistics how many times you're an analyst get on CNBC and say this stock is cheap complete the story because it's trading at a p e ratio less than the average for the sector if that anchor had a brain that might be asking for too much you know what he said about ask the address right away right what's the media you know what most families are what's a median this tells you something about the state of Statistics we're in but if you're using pricing you almost should never use the app right the average is going to be too high today I'm going to show you the average speed ratio for U.S stocks and the median and you're going to be shocked at how big the difference is one final point and this is going to start the process of question to me one of the things that makes for good pricing is when I try to sell you something based on a multiple you know what questions to ask I think you already have the ammunition let's see if you can put it to use so I'm trying to sell you a stock and I'm selling it on a very simple Story the PE ratio for the stock the software company is 12 and the median P let's replace the average the median the median P for the sector is 20. it's trading at well below the mean and I'm saying it's cheap play Devil's Advocate ask me the questions you know what why you're asking a question do you want to see whether it's in fact cheap or whether it deserves to be cheap because there's something holding it back so what's the first question you're going to ask me yes or in this case what's what's a girl trade going to be module so what's a growth right and let's say out of every 100 companies which have low P ratios yes what do you say 60 have growth rates well below the industry average so that's your first reason maybe it has low growth second question pick back to Intrinsic valuation take all the things you're worried about how risky is it and you know there's probably a lawsuit hanging over it said there's you know there's some issues with the company it's a high risk company so it could be low growth it could be high risk let's complete the cycle is all growth created equal we talked about value creating growth and value destroying growth in the context of equity what's the metric we look at to make that judgment on whether growth is good or bad it's an accounting ratio return on Equity because it's equity and I'm looking what's your return on equity and if you have really low return in equity that might explain the low p e ratio could be low growth it could be high risk could be low return equity here's a statement I'll make up from for every 100 stocks that look cheap 95 deserve to be cheap because there's something holding the web what with pricing what you're trying to do is find the five stocks that have a mismatch so let's complete here the the that mismatch here what do you want to find in your perfectly Mr price stock you want to have a low p ratio right you want to have low growth or high growth you want high growth because you want to so you're on a roll here so you start with low PE one high growth you want low risk or high risk lower it so you want low grow low PE high growth low risk you want low return in equity or high return equity you think what chance do I have finding something like this no harm looking right I don't know how many people Access Capital IQ Capital like you could screen any Market you want so here's your first screen you find you say find me every stock with a PE ratio less than 15 you'll get thousands second screen find me companies with growth rates greater than 10 percent you could pick 20 if you want but that might be getting greedy that 1500 stocks will now become 300 stocks and they say find me stocks to the beta less than 0.75 or whatever proxy for risk you want remember you're no longer in the intrinsic value word if you want to go to standard deviation or some other measure of risk the 300 will become 65. the find me companies to return Equity higher than 20 percent 11. you think the only 11 yeah how many stocks you plan to buy right away 11 sounds pretty good to me out of the think of how this that's the screening process so one of the things I want to go through is with PE I said it's growth in earnings it's risk inequity usually and it's return Equity I want to come up with the same kind of mechanism with other multiples easy to sales and EB to Avatar because if you can do that you can do pricing well so let's go back to packet one we have a few pages to wrap up this if you didn't bring back at one fine but um no I want to at least mop up those last few pages but I'm going to introduce the notion of pricing so we're what 18 sessions into this class every session we spent on intrinsic valuation what drives intrinsic value by now you know it's cash flows growth and risk and discounted cash flow model might be the process by which we bring those to play but an intrinsic valuation you're trying to estimate the value of a business based on its fundamentals in pricing the pricing process at least is driven by demand and Supply right you think but aren't demand and Supply driven by cash flows growth and risk yes but they're also driven by mood and momentum in the case of GameStop Revenge I mean who knows what drives its human emotions that's a whole idea of Behavioral Finance trying to explain the pricing process so let's do it let's do a first stop the value process delivers value the pricing process delivers price could the two be different yeah there's a gap let's call it the gap I think this is one of the great things about being the store The Gap is every time you'd go to London I think the the underground that was designed to promote watch The Gap and I keep thinking this is great for the store maybe this is why they picked the name there's a gap every thing in investing is driven by what you see driving that Gap start with one extreme if you believe markets are efficient what's your view on the gap between value and pressure your reaction is what Gap if there's a gap it's random it opens up it shuts down again so if you're a believer in efficient markets it's not that you're you don't believe in but basically assume that the value process in the pricing process delivered roughly the same number let's say your value extremes do you see who's the value extremist they show up in Omaha once every year for that meeting of other value extremists they believe the whole world revolves around their ideal value that the rest of the world is shallow barbarians setting prices so in their view they hold the high ground right their value so what's going to happen over time they convince the price will Converge on value so their viewers who cares about those shallow people well we have The High Ground here but and then you have pricing extra mission my favorite show to be on on CNBC I never watch CNBC the only time I ever am on what's the NPC is when I'm on and I have to watch myself on the screen is Fast Money the fast money is after the market closes there are these four people who get on and you've probably all seen them and they're all Traders not Traders but Traders and I love being on that show because there's no hiding behind we care about value they're open about the fact that they don't care about value at all yes about intrinsic value stuff they say we're Traders you know how you make money as a Trader you buy at a low price you sell at a high price why you don't care you do it by looking at astrological charts all the more power to you it doesn't have to be something rational you just have to make money and I like that Honesty but what are they saying this notion of intrinsic value is in your head you have too much time on your hands you play intellectual games you come up with the value nobody cares people go out and buy and sell stuff think of that as a trading extras I want to focus on the value side let's say even if you're not an extremist at this point you like this value stuff you think there is basis for making money and value let's think about the challenges you face as somebody who believes in value and wants to make money I think you face two dilemmas the first is you valued a company and all the mechanics you come up with the value all right are you uncertain about the value you sent me I would hope so otherwise if something wrong internally right because I mean you're trying to play God you're saying this is revenue growth these are margins this is the sales for Capital and to different degrees of uncertainty depending on the company of valuing you're feeling pretty uncertain about the package so first let's be quite clear you value a company of an estimate of value you don't know the value but even if you feel comfortable with your value the second piece of the puzzle the price has to adjust to Value right is that certain to happen the value extremists think it is but there's nothing in this process that require price go to Value so you're uncertain about the price converging on that you see where I'm going even if you do everything right you're uncertain about your value or uncertain about price adjusting to value which means if on any one company there is a great chance that you could be right and still not make much money it's one of the arguments I make against those people who believe in concentrated portfolios you know what those are right there are some value investors who believe it's probably only five really good companies the diversification is a sign of weakness because you're spreading your bets in my response if you buy only five companies you must feel really certain about the value you come up with and they say yes you must be really certain about price adjusting to the value if you do if you feel that degree of certainty by all means concentrated I'll tell you what I feel I feel incredible amounts of uncertainty when I value companies I feel incredible amounts of uncertainty about whether the price will adjust value and you know how it plays out I have to spread my bets if you view that as a sign of weakness that's fine but I need to do that because of the answer and the greater the uncertainty the more you need to spread your bets do we live in a world with more uncertainty than 40 years ago absolutely globalization has done it disruption has done it if nothing else maybe five stock worked in 1908 in the 1980s it's not going to work anymore but let's focus on disclosing between the price and the bad and think about what you as an investor can do about it so you value the company let's say it's the value you get is higher than the price let's say you actually put some money behind this you go by the stone one approach you can take is what I call the karmic approach what's the karmic approach I don't control this from this point I've done my work I'm going to go back to living my life a very healthy Choice actually but very difficult for most of us to do because you're const partly because we get too much feedback right in the 1960s or 70s you know what made the karmic approach work is you bought something you didn't even know what was happening to it most of the time until you got that broker statement once every three months today you get you know constant feedback your karmic approach is not working not working two minutes ago it wasn't working so in a sense you tend to react the second is it's nice if you can get a catalyst we talked a little bit about this at the start of the class it's nice if right after you buy a stock it has to be right after thinking it's undervalued Carl I can also bought the stock why because he's going to be the Catalyst that causes the change that moves price up to that but unless you have a direct pipeline to call this might or might not happen so let me suggest a couple of other characters one could be a management change management change comes and something that redirects attention to the company but it could be something that is that on the face of it looks very you know you look at itself who cares I remember when Amazon and apple both cost acrossed a trillion dollar market cap around the same time they Now by itself there's nothing special about a trillion from an intrinsic value standpoint 999 million billion 1 trillion who cares right but there is a special we put numbers around but the Dow crossed 30 000. so for whatever reason usually three zeros at the end we think how this is especially not but I'll tell you why even if you're a value investor those things might matter Amazon and Apple cost a trillion dollars I got at least 15 calls that day from different Financial because they wanted to take a look at what is special about the company you see what this means right you get scrutiny on your company because of this arbitrary line and what are you hoping in the process of that scrutiny maybe people will reassess the company and I know it's asking for a lot but you're looking for something that draws attention to the company because you feel that that attention will translate as a characteristic so let me give you a very simple example of how this plays out in real life I admitted at the start of this class that is far too biased to Value Apple but I've done it anyway since 2010 evaluate evaluations are public on my blog and I usually at the end of the valuation say I'm holding if I already own Apple I'm selling if I think it's overvalued I'm buying this is actually an evaluations I did between 2010 and 2019 if you go to my website you'll see it all the way through 2022. so every year at least once a year I visit Apple I value the company and compare to the price so if you took a take a look at my value and price when I first started in 2011 it was no my value was 69 I found it undervalued by 21 now one year later it's overvalued so you can see as you look across those numbers that it goes back and forth right and with apple you can see why the core story for Apple stays the same but people get rationally exuberant when they sell a lot of iPhone 13s and they push up the price too much and they get too depressed when it has one bad quarters this is the end I wish Steve Jobs were back and they sell off all the stuff and you might view that that's so crazy and irrational but this is your opportunity right if you believe that your value is built on a good story and your story and the longer you get familiar with the company the more you're going to get you know more comfortable with your story because you're going to get input data good use for your story don't give up on your stock is what I'm saying I would say right now I'm looking at about 70 over valuations and 30 undervaluations based on your numbers to me so more of you are finding overvalued companies than undervalued companies I'm going to show you what that statistic is look like over the last 30 years I've tracked that percentage of class so you can see whether it's a good leading indicator or lag indicator but many of you are finding your companies to be over back and part of you saying I wasted 10 weeks of my rate I get a grade but this is such a I'm going to be able I'm not going to be able to buy the stuff don't give up on it because it could be overvalued today but a year from now could be undervalued so this is a process you open the door if you really like the company do this only if you're if you picked a TNT because you thought it was going to be easy and you it bored you to help to Value the companies just let it go but if you picked a company that you found interesting and you find it overvalued today keep track of it because it could be undervalued a year from now two years from now because that is the process of price and value the value will move over time but price will always move more it'll overshoot and undershoot and you're trying to take advantage so I'm going to close the intrinsic value section with a picture from one of my favorite movies not this movies right somebody said no come on you this is one of the most it's it's a Wizard of Oz right it's been 1938 it's one of the first colorized movies it's now been digitally recolored but I'll tell you the story The Wizard of Oz and don't jump down my throat because you think the story doesn't make sense it's not my story it's a wizard of odd story so here's what happened to the story this girl called Dorothy is living in Kansas I don't know where in Kansas they don't specify somewhere in the Farmland somewhere a tornado picks her up off the ground and drops her into this mythical land collage I told you don't pick on me I don't make up these stories she lands on a witch I'm always confused about which Wichita which from the East which from the west but she kills the witch so she's facing homicide charges and she wants to get back to kind this is how the movie begins this all happens in the first seven minutes of the movie so if you have a kid take them in 10 minutes late it's traumatic right so she wants to go back to Kansas and she has no idea where she is so she turns into this munchkin by the side of the road I know what else to describe but they're small people and she says I want to get back to Kansas how do I do it we have no idea we don't even know what Kansas is but go ask The Wizard of Oz she says how do I get to The Wizard of Oz just Follow the yellow brick cross and for three and a half hours movie is really long that's all she does she Hops and she skips she never walks if you watch the movie She Hops and she skips down the yellow brick road and along the way she collects this Motley Crew a Cowardly Lion a scarecrow each of them wants something and they each all go see The Wizard of Oz so this group gets together they walk all the way down the yellow brick road three and a half hours later they show up in the Wizards chamber the wizard for some reason is sitting behind the cut that should have already raised suspicion but they weren't they were a very naive group so each of them says I want this and The Wizard says I'm busy today come back tomorrow it's like a government office yeah so we can't come back tomorrow but we've been planning three and a half hours on this brick road coming to you and at this stage the curtain thoughts a world wardrobe malfunction from those days I guess and they see there's no wizard behind the curtain there's this guy pulling strings and rods and he's they realize there's no Wizard of Oz it's a terrible story right three and a half hours later but it turns out that each of them got what they wanted on the journey remember what Dorothy got red shoes right she clicks the shoes she's back in Kansas the Cowardly Lion fought off bad guys got courage along the way we just got to do with valuation maybe nothing but it's a good story anyway right but here's what I think it has to do with valuation valuation is full of people thinking there's a Wizard of Oz out there that if they have a question in valuation if they can find the wizard and ask the question everything will be okay the wizard might have a name like Google search right what tax rate should I use you type in Google search what tax rate should I use when I compute after tax cash flows with chat GPT you can say what would that's what the modern ask you to use as the tax rate and you get an answer right so life's so easy and I think along the way we've lost something of immense value which is we don't try to reason our way to an answer you know already everything you need to be able to answer that question if you said what am I trying to estimate I'm trying to compute the after tax cash flows based in earnings and then you can say well what tax rate makes the most sense you don't need a wizard of oz to answer that question I actually wrote a piece for a teaching magazine called the Google search curse because incredibly that's that's what we do right when we have a question we think you know this is so easy let me type Google search and it sure it saves us time but we're losing that capacity to reason our way to answers and the more we don't use it the less powerful it becomes it's like any other muscle so here's my advice to you the next time you get stuck on a valuation Quest now I'm talking about after during the class you can email me this is the class you paid or not eight thousand ten thousand for this class I'm obscenely high amount you're entitled to ask questions and you should get answers from me but this too shall end right on May 8th and then you're going to go off and it's going to be a year later you're in a at work and you say what should I do here you're going to be tempted to send an email and are you you're welcome to do it I don't even know where I'm getting my emails from most of the time I answer them because it's a safe thing to do but I want you to spend at least 20 minutes thinking about hey how would I reason my way to an answer no it's tough to do because it's become too easy to find answers there work on it because that muscle will get stronger and over time you'll discover you don't need a wizard of oz to answer your questions you learn the answers during the process you know the most useful part of evaluation is not what that bottom number is it's what you had to go through to think about Revenue growth and think about margins and think about painful though it might be that is how you learn valuation is by thinking through how do you answer those questions even if you get them wrong so with that long lead and let's turn to the second packet if you didn't bring the second packet not a big deal but no but at some point you need to get let's talk about pricing I'm sorry did I lose them there you go you guys on Zoom can you see the second packet there are 15 people there maybe they've all gone to a restaurant and slept themselves on so let's talk about it price let's let's set the tech what is pricing pricing as I said is a mindset shift instead of asking what is the value of this business based on what it does what its fundamentals on pricing the question you ask is given what other people are paying for similar things how much would I pay for this thing right that's what price is so if you think of breaking down pricing there's three Parts pricing first is to price something you need to find other things just like it in real estate how does this work out to price a house you try to find other houses in the neighborhood in about you know I was supposed to go to opening day Yankee Stadium with my son who works at a hedge fund but one of the downsides of working at hedge fund is they pay you a ton but then they demand strange things of you like you have to work between 1 and 4 30 in the afternoon it was like Friday afternoon say call me at the last moment said I can't go Dad it's okay we'll go on Sunday and there was a decade and he sleeps in late so 2 30 I get a text from him saying did you get tickets to the game I said the game is already halfway done you just woke up I'm not getting tickets to the game it's too late they said we should go to a game I said I agree so I'm getting tickets to a game like 10 days from now and I went to SeatGeek to get tickets you owe you see it seed geek is an aggregator of all these different sites a nice thing about ziki because you get StubHub you can take they're all there at one place and seat geek not only gives you deals it actually ranks deals from awesome I don't know what the worst deal is but horrific this is a great service they're providing right but you know how they rank the deals they look at other tickets in that section because you know I think the section I got is like 130 or section 130 they take all the seats and the computer is sophisticated enough to know that it's Row three is better than row 10 and I'll see it is better than a middle seat so you've started all these rules so it basically prices you see you can see how it's more difficult with the stock right because you don't no longer have sections and you can have very different pricings for individual companies but that's the first step finding comparable assets which have been priced so you can use that price second if the pricing is all over the place as is the case with equity Berkshire Hathaway is what five hundred thousand dollars per share you got penny stocks you can't use prices to compare you got to divide the price by something you do that you get a multiple standardizing the price you can compare across these companies so you get comparables you standardize the price and if you're careful you ask questions like you did with PE ratio what's the growth rate what's a risk how now what's the return Equity you control for differences all pricing that's essentially the process so I'm going to start with the statement and I'll back it up and a statement I started this class with much of what passes out there as valuation is pricing so let me back up that state about 20 years ago I collected 550 equity research reports from around the world I'll confess I didn't read most of them I collected them because I wanted to Chronicle how equity research analysts came up with buy and sell recommendation what did they base it on out of the 550 equity research reports 45. we're based on intrinsic valuations 45 out of 5 15. the rest you know how the analysts would come up with the buyer itself based on multiple incomparables PE ratio this company looks e because based on these 15 other companies am I surprised not in the least equity research is a pricing job you know why because I put you in a sector what am I what do I ask you to do tell me the three companies I should buy three tell me the two companies I should sell given this sector so much of what passes for valuation and equity research is pricing I said maybe it's different in corporate Financial acquiring companies presumably use intrinsic valuation so I got my hands on a hundred acquisition valuations and this is really difficult to do because you know what Bankers do right after they complete an acquisition they take those valuations they put them under lock and key they try to destroy them complete evidence of them because they're worried that he might actually check their forecast against the actual numbers they don't want that to happen but I have my sources and I was able to get to 100 acquisition valuations and at first sight they looked like more they were more disconnected but have claimed to be discounted cash flow valuations but then I took a closer look and I realized and I might have used this term before but I'll use it again that they were really pricing in Drag what's the drag part remember the biggest number and it's called the cash flow evaluation is the terminal value the terminal value came from using eight times that but that this isn't a discount so even in Acquisitions it seemed to be pricing all the time does that surprise me not in the least because how does a banker make money on an acquisition when a deal gets done so like the realtor he's going to go with the pricing or she's going to go with the pricing so much of what you see out there most of your jobs will end up being pricing jobs to give it and many of you will use pricing and when I first encountered these numbers I was a little surprised and I'll tell you why it's a little surprising when you leave this class I'm going to do an exit interview don't worry I'm not going to ask you about your personal feelings and where you are the exit interview is now that you've taken your company and you've done an intrinsic valuation and a pricing of your company that's what's left to do on your project and thankfully it's much less work than a discounted cash flow valuation now that you've done both if you had to hang your hat on one of these approaches which one would you pick and in this declare in the 30 years that I've been teaching class the numbers are pretty consistent let's see if this semester it varies it's about 70 20 10. 70 pick intrinsic valuation perhaps reflecting my biases 20 say this pricing part was so much better so now I didn't have to do this Revenue growth margin crap that you made me do with intrinsic valuation and 10 become Believers in efficient markets you realize this wasn't that easy maybe I should cut the market some slack maybe crowd wisdom is really crowd wisdom that's actually a healthy recognition if you ask me because think of how much money you've saved over your lifetime now and how much time you've saved because of the recognition that this is in for you but seven to two when they leave my class they're saying that Believers in intrinsic valuation I haven't done this but I should do it one of these days I should track these people down five years after they graduate maybe I'll make this the class where I do it on so around the year 2028 expect some kind of missile for me I was going to say an email but who knows whether emails are still around but I'm going to ask you the question I remember five years ago when you when you left my class I asked you this question what exactly are you using in your job right now are you pricing things are you valuing them I'll wager that the numbers get switched you'll start thinking what is it that happens between the time you leave my classroom and you start working at that trading desk or whatever desk you're at that makes you go from being True Believers and intrinsic valuation to users of pricing and the first of the answers came to me while I was watching a Seinfeld episode everybody's watch Sanford right I mean if you live if you live in New York you have to it's almost a requirement and at least we get soup from the soup guy you know it's a sign for an episode right now but there's actually a sign for an episode one of Jerry's girlfriend's accuses of being crazy says Jerry you're crazy he says if you think I'm crazy you should see the guy lives across the hall in French you know who lives across the hall from Jerry a guy called Craven and I ask you a question relative to Kramer is anybody crazy this is the advantage of pricing we forget how much evaluation is selling it's so much easier to sell a pricing than evaluation I'm trying to sell a company that's trading at 100 times revenues you bark you say you're not cheap he said what do you mean it's cheap look at these five other companies they're trading at 500 times revenues your cholesterol is 350. not bad that's not a problem no it's okay so what do you mean it's okay relative people who died of heart attacks in the last two years you know you look good if I picked the the group I compare you to I can sell you things I can buy things from you because I framed the pricing it's easy to frame pricing to sell whatever you're trying to sell we forget how much evaluation is playing defense you know what I mean by that you value a company then you got to defend the valuation and when you do a full-fledged valuation your insights are out there for everybody to pick apart think about no your DCF I said why is your Revenue growth so high why are you margins going up to 35 why are you reinvesting so little your costly Capital looks low I'm just picking a part evaluation because I can see every piece of evaluation in contrast let's assume you told me that you were pricing your company at eight times habitat why because that's what other companies in the sector trade it think of the target it's tiny right I don't like eight times every day you know what the response your Gloom is take it up with the market with pricing that's what you're saying I'm just a messenger you might not like paying 40 times revenues but everybody pays 40 times revenues for AI companies I'm just delivering the message it's much easier to defend a pricing and here's the coup de gras the reason I think people eventually end up pricing things rather than values I'm a True Believer in valuation but I'll confess for me true belief means I'm going to be right maybe 57 that's a good year 57 of the time maybe 60 percent of the time I think if you do good pricing maybe you'll be right 52 of the time 60 beats 52 right but here's the catch when you're wrong with intrinsic valuation you're far more likely to be wrong alone you see why with intrinsic valuation you're often buying things when everybody else is selling you're selling things when everybody else is buying and you know what happens to people who are wrong alone they get fired here's a simple suggestion if you're going to screw up have lots of company and with pricing you'll always have lots of company why do you buy all those.com stocks in the late 90s what everybody else was doing it doesn't mean you will lose less money but it does mean you will not get fired when I first started teaching this class I used to try to talk people into valuing things overpricing I no longer do because most of you are going to end up with pricing jobs I want to make you better pricers and I want to give you the tools to price things better because even if you're a True Believer in valuation I think you need to understand the pricing process so if your job is pricing of course you need to understand the price but even if you are a true and here's what to make money on your evaluation what has to happen the price has to move to bed understanding the pricing process might give you a much better sense of timing and picking the right companies to make your bets so I'm even though I'm a Believer in valuation now actually price every company I value just to get a sense of what's the market doing understanding how investors are pricing companies in that sector and I want to give you those tools to be able to do the same thing so I'm going to take you through a through the process of pricing but before we do that let's first look at the metric that we end up using this multiple okay let's start with the state an obvious statement every multiple has enumerator and a denominator right the numerator is always a market price number that market price number can be the market value of equity market cap it can be market value of equity plus market value debt which is the overall value of the firm or it can be market value of equity plus debt minus cash which is called Enterprise Value but they're all Market numbers so numerator is always what is the market paying for this in the denominator here are your choices you can divide that number by revenues why would you do that desperation you know why you use revenues because you have money losing companies and net income is negative the ebitda is negative you keep climbing until you hit a positive number you know I don't think accountants are still figured out how to make revenues negative thank God for that small blessing C divided by Revenue so anytime you see a revenue multiple what's the analyst saying I'm desperate I'm going to go to Revenge what if you have a company that's pre-revenue you know a pre-revenue company is just an idea in somebody's mind so what do you divide the market value by random you don't want to use the word random something that might give you remedies in the future now do you see the rationale for using users it's not irrational you're saying I don't have revenues so I'm going to divide by the number of users number of subscribers number of downloads number of people looking at my website it sounds irrational but the denominator needs to be a positive number you're saying what if I don't even have that divide by the number of cars in the parking lot for all I care ultimately you need numbers to scale your Market captive and that's going to be true for every month you could divide bionics those earnings can be to equity investors which is net income or to all investors which is operating income you can divide by cash flows which for the equity can be adding depreciation net income it's kind of a rough measure of free cash of cash flow Equity but you might say look I remember my valuation class I'm going to do free cash flow at equity which requires what capex depreciation working capital you know I almost never see that in pricing why do people do pricing because they're lazy they don't want to make those estimates they're not going to do capex and working capital they're going to stop at net income plus depreciation or if you're looking at the entire firm you can do free cash for the format again that's a lot of work so people take the shortcut which is take operating income add back depreciation amortization which is ebitda or you can divide by what accountants tell you your company's work where did they tell you that on the balance sheet they give you a book value by equity which is and they give you a book value of debt and if you add the book value by Equity plus debt you get the book value the entire firm and if you net cash out you get invested Capital all Book value numbers okay so next time you run into a multiple deconstruct what's in the numerator what's in the denominator because I'm going to give you a four-step process for deconstructing modules I promise you if you follow this process religiously you will be a much better pricer first step in the process is I'm going to start by defining the multiple and some of you are going to feel insulted you think I know what a PE ratio is I'm a junior at NYU I know that when I was six years old I've been trading stocks forever I'm going to challenge you on that when you talk about PE and I talk about P are we talking about the same thing so I'm going to start with defining the market and putting it through a couple of tests to make sure it passes those steps Second Step I'm going to describe the multiple sounds like I'm going to do something fancy right but I'm going to play Moneyball you guys watch that movie make that your assignment for this weekend okay Moneyball is one of the best movies ever made in my when the best books ever written does anybody want to tell me what the movie's about it's Billy Bean who has manager of the X okay so he's a young manager he gets hired and in baseball for a century the way you made decisions is he had these old Scouts who would come around and give you this based on my experience this guy is a crooked elbow people with crooked elbows become great pitchers so you spend 15 million dollars and people make no invest huge amounts of money and Billy Bean after the first fifth or sixth time based on this rule of thumb said these guys have no idea what they're talking about so at least in the movie hires Jonah Hill who's this young MIT graduate who comes in and says we have the data what's your objective in baseball you've got to get around the basis and score it's a very simple sport if you think about it we have data on how many people get to first base how many of those people get to second base and what kinds of people are more likely to get to first place he said let's let the data tell us who to sign so you can pick up this this minor Leaguer who is still got a terrible batting stance he doesn't look like anything Scouts say a great hitter should look like turns out that he walks an awful lot he finds a way you know if you never followed baseball this whole thing is going to be completely mysterious to you but in baseball when you get to four balls and you don't have three strikes or you get to first base and they discovered he was getting to first place a lot more than all these star hitters who had the right I call Kevin Euclid nucleus I absolutely hate because I'm a Yankee fan and you end up working with a Red Sox player and he got on base a lot more than I ever wanted him to but that's data driving your decision so essentially he said hey these Scouts have no idea the rules of them make no sense we're going to let the data tell us do you have the equivalent in markets do we have Scouts going around with rules of thumb rules of thumb right and items earnings is show less than one is one is this crap but you have decisions I can understand the 1960s and you did this I can understand why right you don't have data you don't have data today what's your excuse so when I talk about describing the data I'm going to take all of the data and I'm going to tell you what the right the low PE ratios look at the distribution you're smart enough to figure out what looks low what looks high without me jumping in say eight times earnings is cheap that's describing the data then I'm going to analyze the data analyze the multiple what does that mean remember I promised that behind every multiple are the assumptions you're running away from cash flows growth and risk they're in there I'm going to give you a mechanism for determining what those variables are which will let you ask the right question the next time somebody tries to sell you something as cheap and only then am I going to apply the multiple Define describe analyze apply you know the problem with pricing is people are sloppy they're in a hurry they want to apply things but so there are lots of people using Evita but if you ask them what is the median EB debit for the market there but absolutely no idea and I don't trust somebody who's using a multiple as no sense of what the data looks like in the cross section so I'm going to start with the definition of test I come to you the multiple there's the first Quest test you have to make it pass is it consistently defined I'm saying what does that even mean remember I said every multiple is enumerated in the denominator if your numerator is an equity value your denominator has to be an equity value as well if your numerate is a firm or an Enterprise Value your denominator is to be a firm or an Enterprise Value as well no idea what I'm talking about right late in the evening you had a long day so I'm going to hit you with a couple of actual multiples you tell me whether they pass this test it's like PE ratios what's in the numerator Equity value firm value Enterprise Value Equity value market cap price per share what's in the denominator earnings per share Equity value firm value Enterprise Value Equity earnings right you take net income development thank God for small blessings the most widely used multiple in the world passes the test what about EV to Habitat what's in the numerator market value of equity plus market value debt minus cash market value the operating assets of the company what's in the denominator a rough measure of operating cash flow before taxes and and reinvestment what about price to have it down the analyst invented this multiple should be tarred feathered and driven out of the fraternity if one exists this is a horrifically bad multiple and out of the 550 equity research reports I had 10 use price to every time one of them happened to be somebody who had taken this class an unusual last name so I called the days before email and said notice you've been you know you're an analyst and you're probably do you remember the valuation class you took a few years ago you said vaguely I said it shows right I said what the heck are you doing dividing market cap by a Buddha it's inconsistent he said no no I'm being consistent I said what do you mean you're being consistent he said I use priced habitat for all 15 companies in my sector I said that's a very strange definition of consistency but let me ask you a question have you been noticing that companies with a lot of debt keep looking cheap to you he said yes yes I've been noticing that I said everybody stopped and asked why that might be do you see why if you use price to have it there are companies with a lot of debt are going to look cheap to you let's take an example let's suppose you have a company with a billion dollars and all Equity no debt the company does a stock buyback it borrows 600 million and buys back stock it removes the equity so basically the equity will shrink from a billion to 420 or 450. so the equity is shrunk what happens to Habitat it's before interest taxes and depreciation the more leverage you get the cheaper you're going to look on a price to a better basis before you feel too Superior to this guide every time he's priced to sales you're guilty of the same sin right crisis market cap see how do people get away with the sector where price to sales gets used the most is technology so it's your Redeeming Grace there's no debt You Got Away by accident it wasn't nothing because you were doing the right thing so is it consistently defined is it uniformly estimated what does that mean if I'm comparing p e ratios across 15 companies I want to earnings per share to be computed the same way for all 15 companies I used to think we were home free in the us because we had the same accounting standards right cap and then I discovered especially over the last two decades that he could have the same accounting standards and different degrees of fidelity to those standards in other words you didn't have to break the rules but there's enough leeway that if you're an aggressive company using the same accounting rules you can report higher income than a conservative company and if I'm not careful I'm going to keep finding aggressive companies to look cheap because their earnings are high s p about 15 years ago started a service which they discontinued but they took the earnings reported by companies with gap and actually restated those earnings trying to correct for those things that created these levers the demand was not there consistently defined uniform yes so I'm going to make you apply this with actual multiples let's start with the peer-ish as I said everybody knows what the PE ratios I remember about 30 years ago I subscribed to parents you know I subscribe to parents because they offered to send me a calculator that would compute p e ratios three which is amazing because the days before Wi-Fi and iPhones so I get the the calculator in the mail it's this cheap little piece of crap and it comes with instructions on how to compute the PE Ratio here's what it says enter the price hit the slash they said the slash enter the earnings per share it equal I got exactly what I deserved right price divider earnings per share no wonder it was free even Anaconda Corbin seem to know what the p e ratio was remember Anna konikova you guys are too young to remember her she was she masqueraded as a tennis player for like a decade who's a Russian tennis player masquerade and what said she won nothing but turned up in every commercial you could think of she was like the Maria Sharapova without the talent so this was like 2001 or 2002 this is a Charles Schwab commercial almost canceled my Schwab account right after I saw this commercial where Anna konikova is playing somebody must have been an actress she was actually winning and you know in tennis every two games you switch sides because you don't want the sun in your eye it's not fair so to the middle of the tennis match the switching sides and for whatever reason and it turns to this actress and says price Onyx ratio is price divided by earnings per share and then she kept going on something about preferred dividends that went completely over my head and I remember turning off the commercial Sanctus Anna konikova really know what the p e ratio is supposed to be simple right numerator is usually the current price unless you're one of those technical analysts gone crazy who likes moving averages for things twitch my responses have you ever tried buying a stock at a moving average price go on to Schwab online so I would like to buy the stock not at the current price but the moving average price it doesn't work so it's kind of an irrelevant number but they think smoothing things out makes things better but the denominators where you get the real differences right I can divide price by earnings per share in the most recent fiscal year which is called currency I can divide price per share by earnings per share in the last four quarters which is called trailing PE I can divide price per share by expected earnings per share in the next four quarters which is called forward PE or I can divide price per share by expected earnings per share in the year 2030 which is called really really forward p say why would I do that again desperation you're the biotech analyst every company in your sector is losing money the only tool you have that you would know how to use is PE ratios you know what you do you project the earnings out for every company 10 years forward so that company looks cheap it's trading at eight times twenty Thirty earnings and while you're scratching it say what exactly do I do with that they sell you the stock and move on you can have earnings per share before extraordinary items after extraordinary items before stock based compensation after stock based compensation I remember about 10 years ago I took Cisco widely followed stock and I computed 34 different p e ratios for the company at one point in time different measures of earnings per share ranging from 14 to 60. let's say you're a bullish Anderson Cisco and you're trying to sell me Cisco which of those numbers are going to latch on to the low end of the range or the high end of the range to convince me it's you you're going to go with the 14 and if you want to convince me Cisco is expensive you're going to go with 60. the next time you watch an analyst on CNBC this is not I'm not suggesting you watch CNBC but if you're in the habit of watching CNBC if you see a bullish analyst notice they will always use forward earnings you know why because they expected earnings are higher the number looks lower bear Shameless tend to go with trailing earnings they never talk about the bias in this process but that's how it plays out if I'd been making that Schwab commercial you know what I'd made the actress don't do Anna and ask forward earnings or trailing earnings and then we'd have discovered how much Anaconda covered really knows what about PE ratios but let me build on the tape let's talk about P ratios let's say you're looking at companies technology companies and they use stock based competition let's say they use options so some companies use very little some companies use a lot and you're trying to come up with a metric you can use to compare across companies I'll give you three choices and with each one I'm going to argue there's going to be a bias you're going to end up with and I want you to tell me what bias you're going to end up I could divide price now the market cap by the actual number of shares I'm sorry I could divide net income by the actual number of shares outstanding ignore options entirely it's called primary earnings pressure what kinds of companies am I going to find so I'm comparing across 50 companies some use no stock options some use a ton of stock options which group of companies am I going to find cheap if I take price and divide by the actual number I'm sorry net income and divide by actual number of shares outstanding the stocks that I'm going to find cheap are going to be the companies with a lot of options and think of why my market cap is going to get pushed on because the market knows I have hundreds of millions of options but I'm ignoring it entirely when I do the Onyx per share if I go to fully diluted at The Other Extreme I'm going to switch the bias pushing the other way partially diluted you're neither here another you're still going to have biases you're saying what should I do I'll tell you what you need to do but nobody will ever do this what's causing the problem here I have options and options are not zero one Securities they don't you know lose all value and they go below the exercise price so what did we do in discounted cash flow evaluation to deal with options right we value the options as options you know what you'd need to do you need to Value all the options as options added to the market cap of the company that's a total value of equity in the country because the market cap is only the common shares add this your total value of equity you divide that by the net income that'll factor in the fact that some companies have no option some have a lot of options some of the money options you know why this will never happen because it's too much work the reason people do pricing is they want to do things quickly maybe if Capital like you valued the options for them and told them what they were worth they would start using it but right now Nobody Does it take the Third example I want somebody who might have interned at an investment bank or an equity research Department to volunteer themselves to be my guinea pig now anybody want to come on I will make you look really good I'll make you look brilliant no nobody wants to do this the fastest growing multiple in use you want to be okay good so EV tablet dots is one of the fastest growing multiples in equity research when I started the mid 80s maybe one in 100 equity research reports were based on eBay now it's at 35 of equity research is based in EB turbita and I'll go through what the definition is numerators market value Equity plus market value of debt though we cheat on that one what do most investment Banks use they use Book value and this is how different can it be they can be different but they you know they wave their hands and then they subtract out cash so here's my question why do we subtract out cash but why do we use Enterprise Value why don't we use gross debt why do we use net debt when we compute this month um because it's one of the ways I've heard is that you can assume that your cash balance can be used to immediately pay off any debt obligation so should I be netting out all liquid assets then uh well it depends for some valuations I remember we use cash environmental experience based on valuations we did just that but what if I have some you know receivables that I can convert to cash by factoring them should I net those out to um I'm pushing on the liquidity argument because I can take the liquidity argument you can very quickly see that you know you could make this work what if I told you there's nothing to do with liquidity what do you think it is you're getting closer look at the denominator and you'll see why so I'm going to come back to you what's in my denominator right yeah where does the interesting come from cash show up in an income statement uh show well above or below the line above or below a beta yes below yeah in other words my ebitda doesn't include income from cash I'm taking cash out because the income from cash is not part of my denominator I've now opened a Pandora's Box because in addition to netting cash out of the numerator you know what I should also be netting up what's the other big asset category whose income doesn't show up as part of my operating income we dealt with this in DCF with Emerging Market companies of a lot of these cross Holdings and other companies right you own five percent ten percent fifteen percent of the company that income is not part of it so if I'm Computing EBT ebitda for a company with cross Holdings in addition to netting cash and marketable securities out I should be netting out the Value Cross Holdings because if I don't do that companies with cross-soldings will keep looking expensive to me because I'm counting in the numerator something that is not in the denominator and God help you if you have a majority holding right because think about the mismatch you've created the market knows you own only 60 so that's 60 in there but everything else comes from a Consolidated statement your cash your debt your ebitda are all a hundred percent of the subsidiary see now analyst is just for it I if you wanted a quick fix to enumerator to bring in the portion you don't own what's the number in the balance sheet that supposedly captures that 40 that doesn't belong to you minority interest they will you will see people adding minority interest enumerator the reason they're doing it is to try in some half-assed way at least to get consistency why half-assed because minority interest is a book value and everything else is a market right you thought you were going to run away from Cross Holdings and that's why you didn't want to do this kind of cash flow evaluations and that's why you started using multiples guess what they're going to chase you down and they're going to affect whatever multiple uses so there is no getting around the issues that made discounted cash flow evaluation difficult they're just going to show up in a different form when you use multiples and one final question let's suppose you want to compare stocks to real estate you're trying to decide where should I put my money stocks of course you have PE ratios your VV type of the s p 500. you see is there a metric I can compute in real estate which will tell me whether I'm paying too much for Real Estate there's actually a metric that some housing valuers appraisals or macro housing people use and here's what they do they take the price of a house a median price or an average price or whatever price of a house is and they're divided by the rental income you would get today if you rented that house huh do you see what they're trying to compute right if you're paying a million dollars for a house and you can rent that house out for fifty thousand dollars here a million divided by 50 000 gives you a housing price the rental income ratio so here's my question if that's the ratio you're Computing and you're trying to compare it to an analogous ratio in the equity Market what would you compare to let me try some things would you compare to the p e ratio why why not housing price divided by rental income what is B ratio look at the equity investment in a business right when I divide housing price I'm looking at the entire price of the house I'm not looking at how much Equity invested in the house I'm looking the total price of that so it's more like Enterprise Value than Equity value because you look at the whole price class and the question is what is rental income like is it like revenues is it like advertise it like no it's a tough call right because you collect rental income remember interest expenses you can't count it anymore because you're looking at Enterprise Value what are your expenses it could be property taxes no because you've got to pay those it could be maintenance expenses if you subtract those out you get something like an epider that you can use but if you don't this is closer to revenues than it is to have it no I you know it's it's I'm it's it's a work in progress because nobody really does this on a consistent basis but I think it might actually be worth getting a track record of this over time to see if it does predict real estate historically it goes into boom and bust whether you can get that by looking at this ratio relative to what the bond market is at and what the stock market is at so let's at least get started on the descriptive test the statistics class I give you data what is standard variables you compute on the date it's almost automatic average standard deviation start with that but don't stop it to me the most useful part of this descriptive date is the visual part seeing the histograms because by itself everything else is abstract right mean so you can take Excel compute every conceivable no no skewness cryptosis all that neat stuff but it's kind of meaningless until you look at the distribution so as you look at the distribution here are some of the things I want you to think about is it symmetric or asymmetric that goes back to can I use averages I also want to look at you to look at when I start with data am I losing some of the data in Computing this histogram sounds mysterious but let me show you a histogram I do at the start of every year I've done it for 30 years where I take every publicly traded stock in the US and I compute three different PE ratios current p e trailing PE forward P remember I do this at the start of each year start of 2023 current P would usually be 2021. data right because the most recent fiscal year hadn't shown up yet trailing P would be through September of 2022 and forward PE would probably be from September 22 to at least I'm being consistent on YouTube and then I draw the histogram it's not rocket science I take the data remember what I said about asymmetric distributions you see that in the distribution Peak to the left held to the right in fact I've artificially cut off the tail to the right by counting any p ratio above 100 as a grouping but if you had you know broke that down the tail would keep stretching up so that's the asymmetry in the distribution but here's how it shows up in the numbers I computed the average p e ratio for the company for U.S companies the start of 2023 you know what that number looked like 109.25 times earnings the app if I told you that the average US company is trading at 109 times earnings you should free Cut but it's a lie the median P at the start of 2023 was about 14 times and there's the reason there's a PE ratio of 86 400. there's a very low p e ratio but there's no negative PE ratio to offset but there's one more number I want you to look at see look at the top it says number of companies 7165. but only 3099 seem to have made it into my p e ratio sample so why did I lose the other 4 000 plus companies what happened he had negative earnings I and you think that must be terrible I've done this for 30 years every year I lose at least 60 percent of my sample to negative earnings in years like 2009 I lose 70 percent you might say so what I still have a lot of companies left over you do but do you create bias when you lose those 4 000 what kinds of companies that have negative earnings small companies risky companies young growth companies this is not randomly picking out four thousand I create bias in my averages and Aggregates when I remove these companies and I've struggled with that because if you go to my website I report average speed or PE by sector and when I first started doing this the way I did it was I took the companies which had PE ratios and averaged across them so let's take a sector with 350 companies but only 20 have positive earnings let's take those 20 companies average the 20 and say this is the PE Ratio that's not right because 330 companies I'm throwing out this box so here's what I do now but it's a working problem if you can come up with a better way of doing it I'm willing to listen I add up the market cap for all 350 companies including the money losing companies I add up the net income for all 350 companies including the money losing companies and then I divide the aggregated market cap by the aggregated net income you see what I'm trying to do right I'm trying to keep the companies from getting thrown up because I want to get a sense of the sector and this gives me a clearer measure of that sector so first reason to look at the data is to understand the statistics one more thing as I go from current p and trailing P to forward P I lose another 600 companies why is that what do I need for forward p I need expected earnings next year there's zero chats that I'm estimating expected earnings each for each of 7165 companies see what I rely on right Capital IQ actually gives you expected earnings per share next year that analysts are projected for this company do you know what 600 companies are loose companies that are not Fuller banners what kinds of companies will those be small companies off the exchange companies we create bias in very very without even realizing the choices we make about what multiple to use can actually create biases in our sample until about uh 2003 or four I used to do just us companies not because of parochial but because that's what my raw data was I used to actually subscribe to the service called value line they'd give me a CD every year of all the US companies they track in 2004 I decided to switch gears and here's why I would take this graph that I showed you for U.S companies that go to Sao Paulo or Mumbai or you know and I'd show the graph and some grizzly 50 60 70 year old analyst would put up his hand and say it doesn't look like anything like that in Mumbai I say anything like what well peeked to the left and tail to the right it doesn't look like that for Indian stocks and so how do you know gut feeling I don't trust your gut so I said I'm going to test out whether you got feelings right so I expanded my sample to global companies and this is something I do every year now I graph out us companies Emerging Market companies global companies we look at those charts what's the first thing that jumps out into they all Peak to the left tail to the right doesn't mean that P ratios don't vary across markets and already we're going to start thinking about why PE ratios vary acrossly what's the cheapest part of the world to invest in at the start of 2023 if you just what went lopy uh Eastern Europe and Russia when we put our money there that's a good idea but you should have second thoughts about what you're what's what's the question I forgot to ask before how risky are these companies right Canada is a puzzle we'll come back to it when we start I want you to think about what it is that causes PE ratios to vary across markets because that's going to be the building block for what we start with next session I will see you on Monday and incidentally if you if you haven't sent in your tcfs yet I am leading the window slightly ajar and if you send it I will get it back to you okay okay um 
everything is awesome thank you the reasons okay folks So today we're going to look under the hood of pricing basically we're going to see what drives pricing so to start can you hear me the second row you better hear me the mics work you just have to kind of quiet down so you can hear it better So today we're going to look under the hood of pricing see what drives pricing and I'm going to repeat something I said in the last session that'll probably repeat again in future sessions most of the things that look cheap deserve to be cheap so when you're looking for something that's cheap on a pricing basis I said you're looking for a mismatch I think I'm going to have given you the mismatch but I want you to start off today's session by telling me what that mismatch looks like so you're sure you're going to be on the drive in the driver's seat here and I'm going to let you find a stock that's cheap on a PE basis okay so you want a low p e ratio okay do you want low growth or high growth you want high growth tell me why in other words logo to explain away the low P you don't want low growth you want low growth and I'm sorry high growth and low PE and you were low risk or high risk low risk and low return Equity a high returning I return anybody right so you want that mismatch I want you to keep thinking about those mismatches because today I'm going to introduce you to four other multiples and with each one at the end of the multiple I'm going to ask you for the mismatch Peg ratios Price to Book EB debit because if you can get that mismatch nailed down you're 90 percent of the way to doing pricing right to asking the right questions one other follower let's suppose we look at Revenue multiples we talk about why people like them their desperation drives you there one sector where we you will see Revenue multiples used a lot is retail so let's suppose you're looking across retail companies you're looking for low EB to sales ratios which of these three groups of companies is going to look cheapest might not be cheapest look cheapest on an EV to sales basis and why department stores this country tellers or luxury retailers you want to give that a shot which of those three will have the so you're looking for just low EB to cells which of those three will tend to trade at the lowest multiples of revenues this country tell us and what is it about this country tell us that leads them to Trader Joe multiples of revenues they sell at low prices so if they sell at low prices they have low margins with every multiple I wanted to think about what I call a companion variable what that means is when I try to sell you something based on the multiple that's the first question you're going to ask me this company looks cheap because it trades at 30 of revenues the question you need as what are its margins most of the time the answer is its margins are slim to none that's why trades are low multiples of refers one final picture and this kind of brings home something I talked about at the start of the start of the class second session Maybe and today we're actually going to Value brand name for a company now I want to give you a picture that I'm just going to let it snow stand on its own because it's going to drive how we think about brand names so yesterday I went on the CVS website looking for aspect not that I needed aspirin but I wanted to see if I decide to buy aspirin what would it cost me and I found the CVS aspirin and the bear aspirin both coded both 100 tablets both 325 milligrams there's a bear aspirin 869 that's the CVS aspirin 429 exactly the same ingredients right why is the bare aspirin priced higher because that's brand name power you can do the same thing Sudafed you've got the generic version pretty much all of those allergy medications are now off patent you can see what the difference is so if you can charge a higher price for the same product which financial variable are you most likely to see that play out in I mean does it cost about the same to make 100 the bottle it's pretty much the same right 100 aspirin probably cost you about a dollar fifty at most with the bottle to make it'll show up as higher margins and today we're going to use that insight to determine what the value of a brand name is we're going to use that difference in margins between a brand name company and a generic company to drive how much a brand name is what to Lots on our agendas let me shut off the start of the class let's go back I think slide 18 is where I left you so let's go back to that slide and Jesus we're talking about describe right playing Moneyball with the data we talked about how it gives you a sense of perspective knowing what's high what's low and it's also a great mechanism for countering rules of thumb numbers that people make up so the people say 15 times you know 15 times earnings is cheap a stock that trades at less than Book value is cheap and especially with that but you see these multiples widely used six times epitase G I think it must be ingrained in a lot of private Equity Rule books buy companies for less than six times every time is less it's six times a bit that cheap depends on the time in 2010 Sigma use six times I beta half of all U.S companies traded at less than six times epitome markets are down after the crisis that's a very strange definition of cheapness right half of all stocks traded less than that it could be cheap in 2023 unless you happen to be in Japan you see where I'm going with this why do we have absolute rules of thumb make the 25th percentile cheap that way it'll vary across time vary across you couldn't have done this 50 years ago nobody could have figured out what the 25th percentile is we have the data we need to start using the data I mean how much time does it take to do this in s p Capital like you can do it in 15 minutes take any rule of thumb and debunk it or back it up by just looking at the data so just a general playoff look at the data before you start talking about something being expensive or cheap there is no metric you can use across times that always works so Define describe let's move to analyze there are two questions I need to answer anytime I use a multiple the first is what are the variables that drive this multiple remember I said every time you use a multiple whether you like it or not you're making implicit assumptions about cash flows growth and risk today I'm going to make them explicit these are the variables that drive p e ratio I'll give you a preview P ratios are driven by three variables your cost of equity your expected growth rate and your payout ratio slash return equity how do I know those are the three variables today I'll give away the secret I'm going to go back to a discounted cash flow model with a little bit of Algebra I can tell you what drives p e ratio Price to Book or EB debit not only that in addition to telling you what variables are the driver PE ratio I need to tell you how as those variables change my p e ratio will change take an example PE and growth as growth goes up what should happen to be here issues this should go up right but that's easy how you need to tell me as growth doubles will the p e ratio double or will it go up only 50 because without answering the second question I really can't compare p e ratios across companies so here's the trick you can use to determine what the variables are driver p ratio or EB to have a tower any module I come to you with a multiple first decision you got to make is is it an equity multiple or an Enterprise Value model Equity multiples you usually have market cap in the numerator p e ratio Price to Book Etc and if it's an equity multiple here's what I want you to do go back to the simplest Equity valuation model you can think of why because algebra is a little rusty right now for most of us right in seventh grade eighth grade last time I saw algebra so keeping it with the stable growth dividend discount model is making to make your algebra simpler so it's not that you can't do it with more complicated equations let's start with the simplest mod you can and with a little bit of algebra and that's all you need and I'll show this to you with PE ratios and Price to Book you can take an intrinsic valuation model which gives you value per share and convert it into an intrinsic value model that gives you the p e ratio so it's an equity multiple go back to the simplest Equity valuation model you can think of do do a little bit of algebra and you can tell me what the variables are that drive an equity model if it's an Enterprise Value multiple go back to the simplest Enterprise van equation model you can think of stable growth free cash flow to the firm model do a little bit of algebra and you can tell me what drives EB to epitor EB to sales or EB to invested capital you know it sounds incredibly abstract let's take PE ratios most widely used multiple in the world let's say you want to find out what the questions are you need to ask about PE ratios Equity multiple right so I'm going to go back to a stable growth dividend discount model in a stable growth dividend discount model remember the value of a stock is the expected dividend next year divided by cost of equity minus the growth rate remember in algebra if you have an equation and you divide both sides of the equation by a constant it remains an equation so I'm going to divide both sides of this equation by earnings per share you derive price per earnings per share you end up with PE ratio you divide dividends per share by earnings per share what do you end up with the payout ratio right you think what's this one plus C because I need expected dividends next year the one plus C just brings the dividends out one year take a look at that equation because you've now uncovered the three variables that drive PE ratio the payout ratio the cost of equity the expected growth rate it comes directly out of the dividend discount model now of course you might not trust dividends after all managers sometimes pay too much or too little if you want to replace the dividends with a free cash flow Equity you'll end up with an equation where all you have instead of payout ratio you look at a potential payout ratio a free cashword Equity is stated as a percent of net income take a look at the equation as cost of equity goes up what should happen to be ratios so the r goes up the p ratio should come down as growth goes up the p e ratio should go up and as the payout ratio increases for any given growth rate and that's key I'll have a higher p ratio yet the mechanics in place to ask the right questions about P ratios now of course the pushback you get on this is this is a stable growth dividend discount model what if I have a company with high growth the next page is going to look intimidating at First Sight but don't let the equation intimidate you can I write the value of a company when it has high growth yes in two pieces the first part of the equation is the present value of dividends during my high growth rate this is a two-stage dividend discount model that's all it is there's my present value of dividends it's a growing annuity plus the present value of the terminal price so I've taken what we normally have in an Excel spreadsheet and five rows and three columns and written it out as an equation I divide both sides of the equation by the earnings per share I end up with a p e ratio for a high growth fund and guess what it's a functional payout ratio cost of equity expected growth rate same three variables as I had with the stable growth firm the only difference is I estimate them twice once for the high growth period and once for the stable growth period remember what I said about you want to know how as growth changes the PE Ratio will change if I gave you that equation for the p e ratio and asked you how is how is p ratio changes growth changes and I ask you to put out your calculus textbook don't worry I'm not going to ask you to do it if I did is there a way you can use calculus and you know to kind of answer that question what am I asking you how does PE Ratio changes grow to trust me I'm not going to ask you to do the calculus it's the first derivative right of PE to growth rate as totally I'm not going to ask you to do it but you can already see that if you write it out mathematically you can actually take the PE Ratio and say what will happen to be if cost of equity changes of growth changes if payout ratio changes once you've written out that relationship when I wrote my first valuation textbook got reviewed by somebody in barons and they said it's full of elaborate mathematics or obscure mathematical equations and they were talking about this present value equation this was the most obscurement but we're in big trouble when that when we hit that present value button to hit present value we've forgotten the equation to drive it this is just basically two present value equations one is the present value in the no growing annuity for the dividends and the second is the present value of a growing perpetuity for the terminal value so I'm not going to ask you to do calculus I'm going to use this equation in a much more simplistic way I'm going to give you a hypothetical company it's a company that has high growth 15 growth for the next five years and then after that it's going to grow one and a half percent a year in perpetuity for the next five years during its high growth phase it's going to pay out only 25 percent of its earnings as dividends why because it needs to reinvest to get the growth but beyond year five it's going to grow no pay out 92 and a half percent of its earnings why because the growth rate is much lower for Simplicity I'm going to keep the beta the same in both periods I don't have to I could have had a high beta during high growth and a lower beta later but let's keep the bait at one and finally let's assume the equity risk premium is five percent you know the cost of equity for this company is going to be right but the beta 1 and a risk-free rate one and a half percent my cost of equity is six and a half percent here's all I did I went back to the previous page you know remember the equation and plugged in the numbers for this company 25 payout ratio 15 growth rate six and a half percent cost of equity during the high growth phase ninety two and a half percent payout ratio one and a half percent growth rate and a six and a half percent cost of equity the stable growth phase stay there for a moment if you stay with those numbers I get an answer of 29 you're saying what is that 29.15 even tell me if this company were priced using an intrinsic value so think of this as an intrinsic PE for the company the PE ratio for this company should be 29 times earnings now your first reaction when you look at 29 times earnings that's a awfully High number right what is it about my example that's giving this company such a high p e ratio one is high growth rate what's the other good progress low risk free rate right it's not just the beta is one but I'm starting with a low base when you have a low risk free rate the same growth is going to deliver a much higher PE ratio we're going to use that insight to talk about how PE ratios behaved over the last decade in the U.S and why PE ratios today are lower than they were just two years ago it's got nothing to do with stocks being overpriced on the price it's movements in the risk rate so this company were priced on an intrinsic value basis it should trade at 29.15 times earnings let's say you trust go buy this company it's a high growth company right what's your nightmare scenario you pay high PE for a high Growth Company what is it you worry about that tomorrow you wake up to a much lower growth rate right instead of being 15 it's 12 or so let's say what happens to PE ratio if you get that surprise so if your growth happens to be lower than 15 as you go from 15 to 12 to 9 to 6 to 3 to 0 not surprisingly your PE ratio drops off you think what are all these other columns I've computed how much the p e ratio will drop as a function of your risk creator so I've looked at Ray screen rates ranging from zero percent which is where the Euro was about a year and a half ago to six percent well thank God we're not there yet but we know there are countries like turkey where it's 15 percent so across every interest rate every risk free rate as my growth gets lower my PE ratio gets low but take a look at how much of an effect changes in growth have on your PE ratio as risk-free rates change as risk-free rates get higher the effect of a lower growth rate or a higher growth growth rate become much smaller how do you wake up to this you know so I said you buy a high growth company and then you get surprised with the lower growth rate you know what form that surprise usually takes right gennonics announcement the company says hey guys we told you we're going to grow at 15 but you know what we're growing at nine percent you get a second to reassess and reprice you know what this table is telling you the effect of an earning surprise on stock prices is much greater when interest rates are low than when interest rates are high so I have a generic question why when you get surprised with a lower growth rate is the effect much smaller when interest rates are high than when interest rates are low deep you want to try in fact you know you almost there what's the value of growth it's all in the future right the higher my risk free rate holding all its content what happens to Value growth for every company it gets lower let's take this extreme scenario let's say in Brazil in 1992 you know what the risk credit rate was 5 500 but the risk-free rate is five thousand five hundred percent what's the value of growth zero what if I surprise you and so I'm gonna have more growth still zero what about the president's less growth I don't care as risk-free rates rise the value of growth drops so you're less susceptible to surprises one of the dark sides of having the low risk-free rates we had over the last decade is stock prices became much more sensitive to surprises not because the markets were becoming more irrational or more volatile but because that's exactly what you'd expect to see with lower risk credits so it'll be interesting to see whether this year when you get an earnings announcement and you get a surprise you have a smaller effect on stock prices than you did a year ago for the very simple reason that risk-free rates today at three and a half percent and they were one and a half percent a year ago we'll see but again you're getting some sense of Dynamics about pricing by just using a very simple example here's a second what if I asked remember I used the beta one I said would have debate had been 0.75 0.5 1.25 1.5 no surprises again as my Beta increases for that given growth rate my p e ratios decrease so less risky companies should trade at higher p e ratios for any given growth rate than more risky companies but most of the time though here's the problem less risky companies tend to be lower growth companies and more risky companies tend to be higher growth companies so if you're looking for a superstar here you know that Superstar would look like right be a company with high growth and low risk at the other end of the spectrum if you're looking for investment dogs you're looking for companies with high risk and low growth I'm not saying again you avoid these companies but if you just load up your portfolio with low PE ratio companies guess what you're going to end up holding for the most part you're going to hold a lot of investment dogs because they're going to look cheap to you that's why we do the mismatch test is to make sure we don't end up with the portfolio of Bed Bath and Beyond because that's where you're going to end up is companies that do badly are going to look cheap to you because they're being priced to continue to do bad yes they've delivered higher returns for over time which tells you what that when you're doing badly and there's mean reversion it's you're not getting it because they stay doing badly but over history there's a history of companies reverting back to Industry habits it's me droversion it's a pure better mean diversion and for the same reason if you buy high PE stocks and they revert to the mean you get the same phenomenon player so it's true historically they've looked like good Investments But there again I think with a little more systematic pricing rather than by all low PE stocks is probably by low peace dogs with characteristics that make them more likely to be the ones that revert back to them oh one one final thing let's say the CEO of a company which is high growth and high risk right there are two ways you can try to increase your PE ratio one is you can push for more growth but remember you're still a risky company so as you push for more growth you're staying in this so there's not a whole lot of room for you to move right so whether you go have five percent growth at 25 growth you trade at a low p e ratio the other is rather than go for higher growth you go for Less risks so if you're you're a company the 20 growth rate think of how much more of a payoff you get if you make your company less risky take I'm stating the obvious but sometimes in growth companies people get so focused on growth and still more growth an extra two percent of growth that nobody asked the question maybe it's focusing for higher on higher growth we should be trying to make our earnings more predictable more stable a risk lower because the payoff is much greater one final question it said the hypothetical I said okay I've looked at beta I've looked at growth rates and risk what would happen to this company if it's return in equity were different again I'm trying to counter this proposition that if you have two companies with the same growth rate in the same sector they should trade at higher period they should trade at the same PE ratio so you're again you can see as my return in equity goes up for any given and you can look at every growth rate for any given growth rate I will trade at a much higher p e ratio if I earn a higher return equity I mean this is a long-winded way of backing up odisha pointed out at the start of the class is I have a low p e ratio I want a high growth I want low risk and a high return equity and the backing for that you can see by just taking a simple example and working through how the p e ratio would change as each of these variables changes so let me be very clear we're not using these equations to actually price companies that we point because we can do a discounted cash flow model directly we're using these equations to understand what drives multiples so we can ask the right questions we can screen for the right variables if we decide to use pricing so any questions on PE ratios so I'm going to play a little game I'm going to show you a bunch of different choices that I'm going to make as an equity research analyst I want to play Devil's Advocate and ask me the right questions because each of these I'm going to be screwing up and I want you to tell me what I'm missing with each one here's the first one you send me on a mission and say find me the cheapest markets to be in the world you're a global portfolio manager and I'm the analyst you just hired so here's what I do I go find the companies other countries which have the lowest P ratios and I come back with this list they say you should put all your money in these companies do you want to take a look at that list and tell me what you see on that list these are the countries with the lowest PE ratio that started 2023. what's a common characteristic you see across it they're extraordinarily risky countries right remember what I said most things that have low PE ratios deserve to have low P ratios these are countries that have low peer issues but they're not cheap because they're very risky countries so what what's a mismatch you're looking for you want a country with the low PE ratio and not that much risk right I looked at this list the you know maybe the closest you get is Slovenia it's only almost every other country in there I can point to at least one or two risk variables yep India and China have higher PE ratios than the rest of the world you can argue that they're riskier but what's the other variable that can explain the PE ratio volatility and the return that have been better than the U.S stock market does and I don't know much about the politics of India better imagine the risk is greater I mean history you remember slice of history in equity markets you need at least a hundred years of History before you can make sense of it we're talking about an eight ten year history and if you if you have a market that go on an extended run they can look incredibly good just before they crash I mean I think though it is true India and China have had much higher PE ratios than the rest of the world and on one hand you think that doesn't make sense they have higher risk but on the other hand they also have higher growth and the growth has offset the risk and you know in a sense push the PE Ratio up but that could very quickly change as growth comes down in these countries the risk stays High you have a much steeper drop off in PE ratios that you're going to see in these countries I mean is also function of liquidity right you take liquidity out of a market the volatility we're measuring is validating prices that change a big chunk of the Indian market is relatively liquid so if you look at the sensex and you look at the 50 largest Indian companies you're going to get a volatility that's actually higher than the mid cap or small cap Indian companies so volatility as a measure of risk is kind of a dangerous measure because you're looking at actual traded prices and the less liquidity you have the less volatile a market can look it doesn't mean they're not risky companies it just means you don't see it in the traditional measures voluntary so you'd like to control for differences across countries right so I'm going to take you back to an example from way way back in time about 20 years ago I went and put up a bunch of what would then Emerging Markets so yeah list of markets if the PE ratios if I just look at PE ratios the cheapest Market in the world to invest in then would have been turkey the most expensive would eventually but in this case I'm going to give you three variables about these countries here you have interest rates so help me out with each one if I'm looking at interest rates do I want low interest rates or high interest rates you say we have low PE ratios you want them to go with low interest rates rather than high interest rates the second is real growth in GDP again if you stop and ask what do I want in that I want a high growth rate and finally I have a country risk score the higher the score the riskier the country so if I'm looking for a mismatcher I want a country with a low P low interest rates I want high growth and low risk right you can see already eyeballing the state is just going to make you dizzy this is where I said statistics can help you so I opened up my statistics textbook to the multiple regression chapter remind me again what we do in multiple regression we have a dependent variable we tried to explain right we have independent variables we're controlling for what's my dependent variability what am I trying to explain P ratios what are my independent variables it's going to be interest rates real growth and risk it's not rocket science I ran a regression this is what it looked like so let's see how good your statistics is and you can tell me what this regression is telling first what is The Intercept tell me not much it just tells me the level from which I'm going to build off so you want to build what is this coefficient on interest rates first tell me what does the sign tell me as interest rates go up my p e ratio declines and I can tell you by how much as growth goes up my p e ratios increase and as country risk increases my PE ratios decline this is good news you know why because all of the signs are consistent with what I expected to see don't get used to this because when you try this on your companies on regressions science is sometimes going to go in the direction opposite direction you can't fight the data that's what the data is telling you you got to use it here at least I'm getting data that's consistent with the way I expect it to be you're saying how does this help me find cheaper expenses so oh before I do that r squared of 73 is that a good r squared statistics classes ruin you for life because if you notice everything in statistics classes as R squares of 93 94 percent which my response is why are you wasting your time doing the study if something is an r squared of 95 it's because you're testing something not worth testing like tell me how many calories you eat and how much you weigh need 50 000 calories a day you're going to weigh a lot you drink 15 15 no can't appear every night your GPA is going to be in the toilet I can do all kinds of regressions to illustrate this but it's not helping me 73 is about as good as it gets don't look at gift horse in the mud so I'm okay and I'll later talk about how high does an r squared have to be to be okay and I'm going to argue that it's a wrong statistic to focus on but basically that's what the output does now here's how I'm going to use this regression remember that list of countries I've showed you it's I had the actual p e ratios right there I got a predicted p e ratio for every country to get the predicted repeat ratio what do I do for Argentina I plug in an interest rate of 18 growth rate of two and a half percent a country risk of 45 into the regression I get a predicted value and I do this for every country so Argentina looked cheap at 14 times earnings but once I control for the high interest rates and the high risk I end up with a predicted PE of 13.57 so rather than compare p e ratios across countries what I do is I compare each company's actual PE ratio to what it should be given its risk given the interest rates given the growth in that country now where does that r squared of 73 play out here when I give you this predicted value yeah but but okay so are these predicted P's guaranteed numbers they come with the range right if the r squared is a hundred percent you know what the range is is none it's a perfect number the r squared is 73 the range is going to be plus or minus something and if the r squared is 50 the range is going to be larger and this is why I think rather than ask yourself is the r squared high enough remember it's going to come with consequences you have a low r squared it's not that you cannot use a regression but your regression is going to give you a wider range your company or country has to be much more off your prediction for it to be underpriced or overpriced so when you look at this basically we're using statistics as a tool to control for things that we otherwise cannot control for and it lets you make decisions about which countries are expensive or cheap so if you get I know I would send you the PE ratio for every country if you're interested at the start of 2023. I can send you the PRS score which is the risk score for every country so you can have the risk score and then you want to put in real growth and interest rates it's easy to pull off the IMF for the World Bank databases you can do this across 160 countries how would you use it as a global portfolio manager this might become the basis for you allocating money to cheaper and more expensive markets the most sensible it's a more sensible thing to do that focusing on low PE markets and putting your money in them so we've talked about ype ratios vary across countries let's talk about ype ratios vary across time this is a graph of PE ratios for the S P 500 going back to the 1960s and you can already see that 1970s PE ratios are low then the rows and of course in the last decade PE ratio shot through the roof and there was a subset of investors especially valued investors who viewed this as a red flag they've stayed out of the market for the last decade why because the argument is p ratio looks too high here are four variants the p ratio first is your basic b e ratio take the price the level of the index divided by trailing earnings in the last 12 months that's a PE ratio say what's a normalized b you take average earnings across time because you're worried about last year being an unusual year so not a big deal but the last two PE ratios one is called the cap and the other is the Schiller PE not only look at average earnings across time they adjust for inflation give all these fancy ways of estimating PE ratio here's why they're all a waste of time do they all move together yeah why do we waste our time because adding this finesse makes it look like you're doing something more sophisticated at the start of 2023 this should be started 2022 starter 2023 U.S stocks traded or S P 500 traded about 17 and a half times I'm going to stick with the current P because everything else as I said moves in concert your first reaction is how do I know whether that's a high number a low number or an average number how do I make that decision let's look at the driver's appear ratio to understand the drivers I'm going to start by showing you a graph that's going to look odd but kind of hang in there with you what is the PE measure it measures the level of the index divided by earnings over the last year right what's your alternative we think stocks are too expensive what was your alternative putting your money into bonds right let's say you put into t-bots he won't have a PES you pay the price right for the bond what's the earnings you're going to get on the bond the coupon so we have a two percent coupon rate effectively what's the p e ratio for a t-bond 100 divided by 2 is 50. so you're paying so what you're going to see on the next graph is something I wrote about in a blog a few years ago I said you I know people are freaking out about the PE Ratio they're paying for stocks but remember if I don't invest in stocks I've got to invest in bonds I would rather than look at the p ratio for stocks across time shouldn't I be comparing the p e ratio for stocks to the p e ratio for t-bots you know very simplistic way what I was trying to argue is you can't just look at the PE ratio of stocks here they're high and say don't buy stocks because then I'm going to put my money in bonds that make two percent I'm actually doing worse off than narrative 10 years ago when I Robot stocks at 15 times x so if you look at these two graphs you can see that the two tend to move together not always in concert but the biggest explanation for why p e ratios for U.S stocks was high in the last decade was it t bond rate so long what did they call this you had no better place to go so that you basically you knew stocks were expensive but you said given my old third and you had that condition you said hey stocks don't look that bad but this doesn't allow you to answer the question our stocks overpriced Under Pressure so I'm going to do something with PE ratios that makes them more usable if you invert the p e ratio you divide earnings by price and through price per earnings you get what's called an earnings yield and the nice thing about anointing Shield is you can grab fit against the T bond rate and think about it as making choices I can either invest in t bonds and make four percent or invest in stocks in the 19 year to five percent so what you're going to see on the next graph the red line is the earnings price ratio the green line is the T bond rate so let me start with the easy question do the two look like they're moved together yeah most of the time right you think what's this purple line that's a difference between the t-bond rate and the T build rate t-bond is a 10-year bond the table is a three month table so what am I measuring by taking the difference between the T bond rate and the table when that number is zero what's happening basically it's measuring the slope of the yield curve and that number is big a big positive number I've got an upward sloping yield curve when that number is zero I've got a flat yield curve and that number is negative about you're saying who cares historically whenever the yield curve becomes downward sloping a flat what's the story you start reading about the economy it's heading into a recession historically For Better or Worse the slope of the yield curve has become a predictor of real growth in the economy so here I've actually the earning surprise ratio I have the t-bond rate the level of rates and I have a measure of economic growth at least as seen Through The Eyes of the Yukon my first job was again statistical I said I can see three numbers here I want to see at least at first side it looks like t-bond rates and stock and p e ratios move together statistically that turns out to be true you know correlation between how stock t-bond rates move with earnings to price ratios the correlation is 0.685 which means that Steve Bond rates go up early surprise ratios go up I know it's diff no you got to flip them in your head so higher T Bond rates need to higher earnings to price ratios which is the same thing as saying p e ratios will tend to be low when T Bond rates are eight nine ten percent the coefficient when you do the correlation between earning seals and T Bond versus minus t bill you get a negative coefficient what does that tell me as the yield curve becomes flat or downward sloping I have much lower e ratio so much higher earnings price ratios why because when you have a flatter downward sloping yield curve you have lower growth and basically that leads to lower P ratios again my endgame here is to say tell you whether stocks are overpriced on the price today so let me try to do that by taking this 33 or 43 year history and running a regression of earning surprise ratios at the S P 500 against the t-bond right and the difference between the t-bond rate and the table rate again the starting point The Intercept tells me not doesn't tell me much so that's what I so 3.59 percent is the starting point but every one percent increase in my t-bond rates increases my earnings to price ratio by 0.55 percent think of where we are right now right the t-bond rate right now is about 3.3 3.4 percent there are people out there who believe the t-bond rate could go to six percent so let's suppose one of those people comes to you and says look I think the t-bond rate is going to go to six percent what is that going to mean for stocks you now have the Mechanics for answering the question a roughly three percent increase in the t-bond rate will increase my earnings price ratio by 1.6 percent earnings price ratio goes up by 1.6 percent I'm going to trade at a much lower p e ratio you can now quantify the effect of what do higher interest rates mean for stocks when you look at the difference between the t-bond and the T build rate the coefficient is negative but it comes with a catch see these numbers and brackets below my coefficients what do they measure what are those numbers what are the two two types of numbers you can report in Brackets one is the standard error the other is T statistic these are T statistics is anybody here remember what the threshold for a significant T statistic is from your statistics classes three is asking for a lot right like 99 right be nice to get three but it's two is pretty good right 95 confidence than 1.7 I can live with 1.4 I can push the envelope and if I look at T Bond rates clearly 7.28 I'm way above two three so this is if you ask me is there a significant relationship between t Bond rates and earnings price ratios of course there's no no debate do you ask me is there a significant relationship between earnings to price ratios and the slope of the yield curve right now the answer is not much and I want to point to what this number looked like because I've been doing this regression now for close to 25 years in 2008 when I ran this regression the Euclid mattered a lot more and here's why I think you need to bring that into play every time we get the yield curve going you know going negative or getting flat you get a story in the Wall Street Journal or CNBC thing the economy is going to go to recession next six months anytime now right and I think that's based on history it used to be true but it's becoming less and less true and you can see it play out in the data for whatever reason the yield curve has become a poorer predictor of economic growth than it used to be and maybe we don't we need to be a little less you know feel a little less urgent to jump on and say the you curve is downward sloping therefore the economy goes into recession now let's suppose I gave you this equation right there that's an updated equation r squared of 46 not bad I'm trying to explain changes in p e ratios across time using only two variables then I asked you are stocks underpriced overpriced today is there a way you can use this regression equation to answer that question what's a t-bond right now 3.3 percent right so plug in 3.3 percent there what's the table right now about 4.5 you plug in 4.5 so you got a downward sloping yield curve if I plug in those numbers and get a predicted earning surprise ratio right now I get about 5.9 percent as my predicted earning surprise ratio let's round it up to six percent if that is my predicted earnings price ratio you invert that you get a price earnings ratio of roughly 16.4 16.5 given where rates are today and the slope of the yield curve today I would expect the PE ratio for the S P 500 to be about 16.5 it's actually trading at about 17.3 times earnings shouting distance right so if you want to make a case that stocks are overpriced today you better make a case that's going to come from a different place with a different argument given where rates are today I would expect stocks to trade at about 16 and a half times earnings they're trading it roughly if they were trading at 25 times earnings today then I'd say you know what given history stocks are over price but that's not what you see when you plug in the numbers so I don't know exactly what the numbers will look like if you plug in today's t-bond rate but at the end of trading today why don't you pull the T bond rate take you two minutes to plug it into the equation see what the predicted earnings price ratio is and compare it to the actual earn Express ratio you can invert it into the p e ratios and see whether you can come to the say no conclusion but the stocks are fairly priced overpriced or underpriced it's a pure pricing judgment as opposed to it remember we did an intrinsic valuation of the S P 500 we had to do these elaborate dances about earnings and cash flows and payout ratios the far simpler exercise you're saying given but the history of pricing is our stocks underpriced overpriced any questions I'm going to move on from PE ratios to ratio called the PEG ratio it's a very strange ratio let me describe how you compute the PEG ratio for a company we know how you compute p ratio they take the price per share you divide by earnings per share you say let's say you come up with a p e ratio of 25 for your company and let's say this is a company with an expected growth rate of 10 a year for the next five years so let's give it a five-year growth rate you got a p e ratio of 25 a growth rate of 10 you divide the 25 by the 10. use the absolute value for the growth you come up with the PEG ratio of 2.5 you're saying what the heck do I do with this as with PE ratios you want a low PEG ratio that's an indication of cheapers you know why the PEG ratio was invented in the 1970s a guy called Peter Lynch you might have heard about him legendary investors and he was the first person to run Fidelity Magellan which is the first growth mutual fund so he's given this mission of start a growth mutual fund invest only in growth companies and he ran into a bit of a prompt because at that time the only tool that investors had to pick cheap companies was PE ratios the rule was pick low PE ratio companies and he very quickly realized he could not run a growth mutual fund picking companies to traded less than 10 times x why because at high growth rates and high PE ratios so you wanted to concoct or create a multiple that brought growth into the market you see how PEG ratio solves the problem right if you have a high growth rate you can have a high PEG ratio and still look cheap so if you're a company with a 40 growth rate even if you traded 30 times earnings your PEG ratio is only 0.75 you could come out as cheaper than a company that trades at 10 times earnings with a five percent growth rate to the origins of the PEG ratio are hey we want to pick high growth companies we can't do it by just looking at p e ratios we've got to create this concoction the PEG ratio and now there are a lot of tech analysts have latched on they use the PEG ratio to pick stocks now I want to introduce an order caution here the argument that many analysts use for using Peg ratios is they argue that growth is now out of the picture you could now look at the peg ratios across companies you've controlled for growth let's say if that is true that using a PEG ratio neutralizes or removes growth from the equation to answer that I'm going to go back to the two-stage dividend discount model that I used earlier for the PE ratio and I'm going to divide first by earnings and then by growth and if I do that I end up with a version of the model for the PEG ratio remember the the sales pitch growth disappears is growth gone from the equation it seems to be all over the place it's in the numerating the denominator it's a complete mess and that's part of the problem with PEG ratios is rather than neutralizing growth it creates this very convoluted relationship between Peg ratios and growth range so to understand why this is a mess I'm going to go back and look at how Peg ratios play out when you look at a hypothetical company but let's take the parts of the equation that are still readable holding all its constant as I increase the risk in a company what should happen to the PEG ratio for the company the same growth rate um the peg race you should go down or go it should go down same growth rate more risk so you have lower p e ratio lower PEG ratio higher risk companies should have lower Peg ratios than safer companies for a given growth rate second if you look at what drives growth and you look at return Equity higher return and Equity companies should trade at higher Peg ratios than lower return Equity companies so risk and return Equity you're fairly unfair fairly safe ground on growth all bets are off the USB is high growth could lower my PEG ratio raise my pack ratio I'm not quite sure because it depends on what segment of the growth curve you're on so I'll to kind of illustrate that I'm going to go back to the same example I used for PE ratios remember the high Growth Company the 15 growth for the next five years I computed the PEG ratio for the company and remember this is an intrinsic two-stage dividend discount model applied to the company the PEG ratio that end up with this company given its characteristics is 1.94 this stock should trade at 1.94 times growth in terms of p e ratio it'll be fairly bad let's see what happens when I increase the risk in this company if I hold all its constant increase the risk across the board the peg ratios come down higher risk companies will have lower Peg ratios no matter what beta you pick what growth rate you pick High the higher the risk the lower the PEG ratio the reason I emphasize is that you know as I said Tech analysts often use Peg ratios companies as you know cheap or expensive it's a couple of weeks ago I saw an equity research report on a tech company very risky software company and the analysts had taken the PEG ratio for the company was like 0.78 and compared to the PEG ratio for the S P 500 which is 1.4 and said hey that shows this company's cheap it's PEG ratio it's lower than the PEG ratio for the s p 500. you see what the problem with that is right you've got a risky company it should look cheap on a pack ratio basis if you want to compare it you should be probably compared to the PEG ratio of other risky software companies and then you can tell me the company's cheaper expensive but you can't compare companies with different degrees of risk on a PEG ratio basis if I change the Roe again higher the Roe the higher the PEG ratio here remember I'm going to ask you what it what a perfect mismatch company is going to be on a PEG ratio basis a higher return Equity pushes up the PEG ratio again because growth becomes more valuable and then I tried growth and you can see what I meant about things getting confused initially as I increase my expected growth rate my PEG ratio decreases so you think this is good higher PEG ratio is lower my higher growth rate slower my PEG ratio but there's a point at which it reverses and goes in the opposite direction otherwise it's almost a U-shaped relationship initially as growth goes up big ratios decrease but then they start increasing but so who cares help me out on a perfect underpriced stock at a PEG ratio basis you want a low pack ratio right you want low risk or high risk you want low risk because high risk could explain it away you want low return Equity a high return equity when high return Equity so you want low PEG ratio low risk High return Equity you want low growth or high growth you the answer is somewhere in the middle growth and already you can see why this is a mess right what is somewhere in the middle growth even mean can you go into capital I can say find me companies somewhere in the middle growth try it out right what's submit in the middle growth this is precisely why I think we should ban the use of Peg ratios in equity research because it's extremely dangerous if you can't tell me which direction something is going to go to keep using it to tell me something is cheap or expensive PEG ratio is an abysmal multiple the fact that people use it doesn't make it okay precisely because of this very very very strange relationship it has with growth so I know why people use Peg ratios but I'm very very quick I question anytime I see a company labeled as cheaper expensive on a PEG ratio basis exactly what I found with that PEG ratio so if you asked me to summarize what we've learned from looking at all these different graphs first is high-risk companies will have lower Peg ratios than low-risk companies if you just pick companies based on low Peg ratios you're going to end up with a lot of risky stocks but uh 25 years ago Morgan's standing with a lot of fanfare that Quant group put out this investment strategy where they broke companies Down based on Peg ratios and they said if you buy low PEG ratio companies you will earn three percent more than the s p 500. you know the on what the question they never answered was right these are also riskier companies is that three percent sufficient to cover the higher risk because by itself you've told me nothing by showing me low Peg ratios have higher returns second conclusion holding all its constant higher return on Equity companies will have higher Peg ratios and low return Equity companies that's why when you see a company the low PEG ratio you need to ask a question what are the returns in equity in this company does that explain away the low price ratio and with growth as I said all bets are up because of this in the middle effect of that's where the peg ratios are lowest because you can end up with a low PEG ratio if you're if you're close I mean maybe the way to describe it if you're close to the average for the industry you're more likely to have a low PEG ratio than if you're either extreme either too low or too high a growth rate so p e ratios egg ratios let's talk about Book value multiples what drives Book value multiples is Unholy trust we have that accountants actually know what they're doing right because what are you doing in Book value you're telling me this is the market value of equity this is what the accountant tells me the value of equities the book value of equity let me take the ratio of the two you know what the rule of thumb looks like with Book value multiples right the stock trades at less than Book value it's cheap if it trades at more than Book value it's expense and that's built I think on this belief that book value and liquidation value are somehow interchangeable which is silly because if you think about the book value of most companies you're not going to get that liquidation it doesn't even mean much but Price to Book it's been around for as long as people have been investing comparing what you pay in the market to what the accounting buff valuation so I'm going to do the same trick it's Price to Book as an equity multiple I'm going to do it what I did with price Onyx ratios go back to a stable growth dividend discount model divide both sides by the book value I end up with an equation for The Price to Book ratio The Price to Book ratio is a function of the cost of equity the growth rate the payout ratio so far the same three multiples that you had thus new multiple pops up which is the return equity I talked about companion variables with Price to Book it's always return in equity so when I tell you a stock is cheap because it trades at a low price to book ratio and I allow you only one question that question should always be what's the return Equity at this company because most of the time when something trades at a low multiple of Book value it's because it is an abysmally low return equity but I can actually take this equation for the price to book and simplify it by taking remember when we talked about sustainable growth does anybody remember what the growth in earnings per share was written as the sustainable growth equation was a product of two numbers one was the return equity and the other was the retention ratio right remember we wrote that as one minus the payout ratio if I plug that back into the price to book ratio equation something magical happens a Price to Book ratio for a company can actually be written as the return Equity minus the growth rate in the numerator and the cost of equity minus the growth rate in the denominator if you believe that equation when should stocks trade at roughly Book value what should be true by the return equity should be roughly equal to the cost of equity we stock trading at less than Book value it's because its return Equity is less than the cost of equity if it trades it well above book values because it has a return Equity well above the customer Price to Book ratios are a function of return equity and cost of equity now if I wanted to take the price book of courses in equity multiple if I wanted to give you the Enterprise Value analog to this instead of price what am I going to do I'm going to use Enterprise Value market value Equity plus market value debt minus cash and sort of Book value Equity what do I use in the denominator I'm going to start with Book value of equity plus book value debt minus cash which is invested capital if I replace this equation with Enterprise Value to invested capital that's the right hand side going to look right instead of return and Equity if I'm looking at an Enterprise Value multiple it's a return Equity what should I be using instead return on invested Capital insert cost of equity I'm going to use a capital in fact Enterprise Value invested capital is return on Capital minus the growth rate divided by cost to Capital minus the growth everything we talked about excess returns how they value growth depends on how much that plays out here it's exactly the same effect playing out in a month so with price earnings it's growth payout and risk but Peg ratio's growth pay out and risk but growth has a strange relationship with Price to Book its growth pay out risk and return equity with Enterprise Value invested Capital it's growth payer you know not payout but retention ratio risk and and return so basically you can see the drivers of each of these multiples just by doing the basic algebra Enterprise Value to ebitda when I first started equity research mid 80s I think out of every 100 equity research reports maybe one used EV to have a term today we walk into almost any equity research Department anywhere in the world a third or more of all equity research is built on EB debit and there are good reasons and bad reasons for why you've seen a shift away from petv debica give me some of the good reasons why equity research has shifted away from Price earnings ratios confusing might not but it's it's a much more so you're saying net income is much more volatile than habit does so price earnings ratios 10 so one reason is EB turbita doesn't jump around as much as p e ratio so it's you know it's you can use it more okay One Good Reason you know you know it turns out that capital structure affects everything but p is affected more by the capital structure than ebitda because if I take a lot of debt I can make my p e ratio high or low depending on it so second is it is affected more by leverage than EB debit what else well if you have lots of debt and you have a bad year you know guess what the earnings can cut both directions they can either in a really good year the earnings can look really good so your PE ratio can be low so markets know that so your PE ratios tend to swing from very low to very high numbers or early level companies third remember when I showed you the distribution for PE ratios I started with 7 000 something companies and ended up with three thousand and why did I throw out four thousand because they had negative net income some companies have negative ebitda as well but there are far fewer companies with negative ebitda than negative net income and that's a good thing you lose fuel firms to some good reasons why we've shifted away and you also have to worry less about depreciation methods and some companies using straight line and others using accelerated depreciation but there's one really bad reason for shifting away from PE ratios most of us even if we're amateurs in markets we don't follow markets much have a sense of what a high number looks like in a PE ratio right so if I say no this stock is a PE of 50 you probably said that sounds like a high number why because you'll be listening to CNBC or off and on something and you say 18 times earnings 20 times earning 50 times earnings outside if I come to you and say this stock is an Eevee to epitaph 10. most of us have no sense of what a high or a low number so you know what happens is as human beings when you don't have a frame of reference guess what you compare it to you know you shouldn't be doing it but 10 times I have a targets compared to 18 times earnings they say both earnings numbers ten times habitat must be a low number you see why people selling companies use EB to Avatar multiples when they say eight times every time you get all excited that sounds cheap why because you have no frame of reference it's easy to develop a frame of reference you want to but the next time you run into an analyst using EB to epitome octopus ask them a very simple question what is the median EV to epidermal to put for the market I asked this question every single time I almost never get the right answer how the heck can you walk around telling me something is cheap based on a multiple if you don't know what the typical value looks like in the market yeah if it's not even the answer physical most of us are unsophisticated if I asked if I went around would you consider yourself unsophisticated I would greatly if you went to on on the floor the New York Stock except or you walked in an investment bank and you walked her and asking Bankers what's the median EB debit for the market not one of them will know the answer they'll tell you I can tell you what it is for my sector no no that's not the answer I want I want to know what it's for the market the reason is it's not talked about the only reason we know what PE ratios are is it it's become part of the conversation right whether we like it or not people talk about it what is the last time on CNBC people said the EB debit down for the market is I have no I've never heard it and people take advantage of it and of course when I go to eb2 per user EV per subscriber it gets even worse because I've been even less of a frame of reference so when you think about what's Driven the growth of EV debit cards I know it's a bad reason but it's the reason that you can sell some real dogs using Eevee to have a down multiples they look cheap because you're not used to using those numbers you don't have a frame of reference to those numbers so for better it was what's surrounded by EV tab it does I want to give you the tools to address what are the questions I need to ask when somebody tries to sell me something based on me to epidemic so again by now you know the trick right so you should be getting bored at this point because you know I'm going back to the same rule book over and over again Enterprise Value multiple right so I go back to the simplest Enterprise value equation that I can think of free cash for the firm next year minus growth I'm going to do some things that look silly but I'm going to do it anyway I can actually write free cash of the firm in terms of habitat makes my algebra a little easier if I wrap it down the right hand side as well so so ebitda times 1 minus t plus depreciate trust me it is exactly the same thing as your traditional free cash for the firm calculation then I divide both sides of the equation by a bit down so I'm going to list out the variables that drive Evita in your mind I want you to start thinking about what a cheap company will look like on an EB to Avatar basis first up is your tax rate the higher tax rate the lower your EB debit does going to be as a company not if only we did PE ratios we didn't care about tax rates right why when you use p e ratios do you not care about tax rates but use EB to Habitat you've got to care about taxes when I do PE ratios what's in my denominator net income or earnings per share right so if I have high taxes it's already in my income if I use a pre-tax number this is true not just for Epitaph I use ebit or any pre-tax number I've got to stop it ask the question what's your tax rate because for all I know your tax rate might be a hundred percent in which case why am I paying for your company right now it sounds absurd but I need to know what the tax rate is second stop is I'm going to ask you what a depreciation capex and change in working capital but if you think about those three items is there an item we had in our valuation where those three items got Consolidated that's my reinvestment holding all its constant the more my reinvestment is for any given growth rate the lower my EB debit does going to be why because dude if I'm reinvesting more to deliver the same growth rate I'm being less sufficient so tax rates matter reinvestment matters go to the denominator holding all its constant the higher my cost of capital the lower my EB debit our riskier companies should trade at lower EV debit our models and finally holding all its constant the higher my growth rate the higher my EB debit so help me out here give me a cheap company in EV table databases I want a low EB capital tax rate do I want a low tax rate or a high tax rate I want a low tax rate because a high tax rate would explain away so I want to load tax rate do I want a low costly capital or a high cost to Capital I want a low cost to Capital low Evita low tax rate low cost to Capital low growth high growth burned high growth and finally when you look at reinvestment for a given growth rate I want as lower reinvestment as I can find so when you look at companies again you're trying to find that combination that makes for a cheap company because a lot of companies that trade at low EB to Avatar multiples have terrible returns and capital I've reinvest huge amounts or have high cost of capital which explains why they traded the multiples that they do so as with my p e ratio example I'm going to go back to a hyper the nice thing about working with a hypothetical companies you can hold everything else constant and change one thing at a time so I have a company which has a 36 tax rate capex is 30 of Epitaph depreciation is twenty percent of cost to Capital is ten percent for the moment Let's ignore working capital you know one less variable to keep in mind if you plug the numbers in the EB debitar for this company should be 8.24 again this is an intrinsic value EB to hepatitis this is a discounted cash flow model that's what the EB debit Dash should be it's not about right right eight times habit down but that's what the 36 tax rate you know what that number would look like if that is zero percent tax rate be 16 times epitaph if the tax rate were 50 it'll be less than six times ebitda you're saying when would I ever have differences in tax rates like those let's say you decide to become or you get hired to become the Telecom analyst for Europe think of who's in your sector you've got Deutsche Telecom which is roughly 12 30 tax rate you have Irish Telecom which is a 12 tax rate if you pick companies based on low EB turbine Deutsche Telecom is always going to look cheap and Irish Telecom is always going to look expensive increasingly as our databases become Global and we're comparing companies across different countries especially in EB debit databases you've got to control for differences in tax rates if I hold my growth rate constant increase my net capex as a percentage of ebitda in other words I've got reinvest more to deliver the same growth rate my EB debit card gets lower because I'm being less efficient about delivering groceries which is just another way of saying by return on capital is higher for a company or any given cost of capital I will pay a much higher EB debit for a company again I'm providing backing for that pricing that you did I want a company with a low ebitda a low tax rate low reinvestment and a high return on Capital because that's going to be the company that that's that's really cheap you know it's not a company that deserves to be cheap I know you guys are exhausted last multiple you know why people like Revenue markets right because you get desperate you move up the income statement and there are two versions of Revenue multiples you run into one is price to sales and we talked about what's wrong with price to sell somebody remind me again why price to sales is problematic because my new rate is market cap which is just Equity value and my denominator is revenue which belongs to everybody right which is one reason why when you see Revenue multiples you should be using EB to sales no matter whether the company is debt or no debt don't fall into the Trap of using price to sales even though it might seem simpler because it's just internally inconsistent the EB designs what do you think the companion variable is for Ev to sell see I think you gave it away because when we did that discount retailers what we said was it's margins so when I do the algebra and I'll save you I would I would torture you by going through the algebra again but if you want to trust me on the algebra there's a variable that drives easy to sets the companion variable what's your after tax operating margin higher margin companies will trade at higher multiples of revenues lower margin companies should trade it lower multiples relations I'm going to end the session today by using this to talk about the value of a brand name as I said brand name companies are pricing part we have pricing by of higher margins so one way to think about the value of a brand name is ask yourself what will happen to my company if I lose that pricing power every brand name company that's your biggest fear right what if I lose the pricing power and you can actually value the company with its existing margins and revalue the company with lower margins that different should be the value per brand which is about maybe 20 years ago somebody had gone through this class went to work for Coca-Cola called me and he said you know can you come into Atlanta and talk to our management team what a valuable brand name they're kind of obsessed about brand name valued Coca-Cola and they want to get a number because they know accountants are going to try to put a number and I said sure so I showed up and the management team had gathered together I brought a Pepsi with me because I wanted to really piss them off but because they weren't paying me they couldn't do a thing and I took them through a valuation of Coca-Cola so initially I value Coca-Cola and I you know it was a cup let's face it Coca-Cola is a company that's unique among beverage companies because they spun off their bottling arm so all you have in Coca-Cola is a sir says it's close to Pure brand name as you can get so I value them with their and they had some really good characteristics that high margins and a high return on Capital and a high growth rate I played it to I come up with a value of about 80 billion I finished the valuation first in the front row head marketing haunt short Coca-Cola puts up his hand he says but you move you forgot something very important Advocate a beverage a geography so what did I forget you've forgotten the fact that Coca-Cola is one of the most valuable brand names in the world what exactly do you want me to do he said you should be adding at least a 20 premium I said why I said because that's what we do at Coca-Cola is when we buy brand name companies in other countries we value them and then we add 20 percent it's just because you do stupid things doesn't mean I have to do stupid things too he said don't you think our brand name has value I said the only thing in this building of any van the rest of you I can get rid of you leave the brand name the value is going to stay intact he says why aren't you adding a premium I said it's already in there he said where I said everywhere he said why do you think you have a 15.57 margin is it because you think Texas actually matters no it's got nothing to do with taste it's got everything to do with brand name 15.57 much that return on Capital coming entirely from brand name you know what he said I don't believe you this is what happens when you when you did when you argue with marketing people this is exactly the kind of response you get but I came prepared I knew this question was coming and I got lucky I found a company called caught it's a Canadian company that sells almost as many cans of sodas Coca-Cola does you've never heard of it right you walk into a grocery store you know the generic sodas that you find take a look at who makes these sorters it's usually caught they let you buy into your own name that's why you never see their name they don't put card sodas you can put Grand Union or whatever the grocery store is he said okay let's play a game Let's suppose we all walk wake up tomorrow with Selective amnesia the entire world and the only thing we don't recognize is that red can in the words Coca-Cola it's every marketing person's nightmare let's make it come true your brand name goes away what happens your pricing power goes with it right you know what cards margins are 5.28 one third of Coca-Cola's merchants so here's what I did I took Coca-Cola I'm not comparing Coca-Cola with card I'm comparing Coca-Cola with Coca-Cola without its branding giving it generic margins it has a ripple effect lower margins translated into lower returns and capital lower returns in capital translate into lower growth rates you trace it all the way down the value that I get for Coca-Cola with its brand name gone is 15.4 billion dollars you want me to add a brand name premium I just did in fact you take the difference between those two numbers I have a 64 billion dollar value I'm attached to the brand name if you don't think it's enough tell me why but don't ask me to add 20 percent I'll leave you with the with an anecdote about what to think about all these things that get thrown at you after you do evaluation sometimes physically thrown in which case get out of the way is it you know there used to be this old commercial for spaghetti sauce called Ragu spaghetti sauce still around but there's a commercial that used to run all the time the way the commercial plays out is this 45 year old Italian man is visiting his mother for dinner he's a big time loser you can tell he shows up at his mother's house for dinner all the time so he walks into the kitchen this is how the commercial goes plays out and the mothers at the get the kitchen stirring this big pot of spaghetti sauce surrounded by empty bottles of Ragu he says mom what are you doing making used to make spaghetti sauce from scratch why are you making it out of a bottle and start listing out the ingredients I'm not that good at spaghetti sauce ingredients if something doesn't below so where's the tomatoes it's in there where's the oregano it's in there where's the Cayenne it's in there I'm Indian I throw Cayenne into everything so basically and basically the response for everything is it's in there and that should be the way you think about valuation if you do a good valuation it should all be in there they're no garnishing allowed we thrown at the top so as you look at Brad name it and when we start next session I'm going to talk about why it's more difficult to Value brand name in a company like and like Apple than it is for Coca-Cola but think about brand name through pricing power and it's going to give you at least an opening for why you add a premium to these companies 
pretty cool experience the seed is taken thank you thank you because that's Growler and I've been I've had four iPads okay folks time to get started we're in session 21. which means the end of the session would be 75 percent of the wage done with this class which is my indirect way of nagging you saying if you've not started on your you know project get started because there are a few of you've never sent me a DCF I have no idea where they even picked a company and I've given up trying so if you do finish a DCF by the next I mean I know the window is long being closed but I keep opening it a little bit and letting a few DCFS in so if you really want feedback I'll still give you the feedback okay so today we're going to almost complete the pricing set last session if you remember and I'll be quite honest that's the session I dread the most in this class since the last session because you know it's multiple after multiple algebra algebra and after a while you get you know I have to know what that equation does but what was the why were we doing that other than to torture you why did I go through multiple my multiple is sure you are and why do we need to know what's driving them also those are the questions you're going to ask me right so think of it as if somebody's trying to sell me shares on a Price to Book ratio what are the three four questions that's the end game so we're going to come back and talk about reviewing that but I want to start today with something that each of you potentially could face at the end of this project she valued a company you come up with a DCF ad as I said about 70 I don't know whether I mentioned about 70 percent of you in your DCFS that you turned in found your company to be overvalued about 30 founded to be undervalued some are in that statistic so you got a valuation of your company so let's say value company come up with the value of ten dollars per share the stock is trading at 15. if I stop right there this is a slam dunk right because what do you have to do decide whether to buy or sell the stock and based on that valuation what do you are you going to buy or sell stocks at 15 you valued at 10. come on you got a 50 50 shot you'd say I'm not buying I'm selling it's over that but then you do the pricing which is the next and second phase and much shorter phase and you price your company to software company against other software companies and you come up with a pricing that's the right word but you call it evaluation let's call it say twenty dollars you're faced with a quandary right is the stock and overvalued which is what your DCF tells you it is is it under priced or valued What's um what the multiple or could I take the 10 and the 20 and add them up and divide by two this is so convenient because then you get 15 and it's right don't even go there okay so when you valued and priced your company for God's sakes please don't average the two and say no I'm uncertain about both numbers I'll take the middle that's like saying I'll be a Muslim the first half the day and a Christian the second half you're going to be you're going to have a tough time splitting the difference and trying to reconcile irreconcilable differences somewhere along the way philosophically these are very different ways of thinking about value you can't take the middle ground and say hey that's the best place to be can I make the argument that this talk is both undervalued and overvalued at the same time sounds odd right now do you see why I kept asking you to use the word priced when you did pricing because it's underground it's in this case underpriced and over that both statements are true today I'm going to give you a couple examples with companies I valued already in this class that I'll price again and come up with a very different conclusion and say I'm okay with these they're not contradictory because I'm asking two different questions so that's the first part let's take um probably stay with pricing when I talked about pricing I said pricing is based on who you compare your company to it's based on the compromise today we're going to talk about expanding the compromise look at the entire Market can you price the stock against the market I don't see why not look at what every other stock is priced let's say you do that for this company same software company and you come up with a pricing of ten dollars again based on pricing it against the market so now you have ten dollars from your intrinsic value twenty dollars from pricing against the sector and ten dollars pricing against the entire Market you know how can you get two different pricings depending who you compare it to you know what it's telling you though right the fact is if you get a ten dollar pricing against a market and a twenty dollar pricing is a software sector that tells you about how the Market's pricing software companies because if it pushes up the pricing of every software company when you price a company against other software companies you're going to feed it in we were just talking about chat GPT and AI companies right now the pricing is all high if you price any AI company now you're going to get a high price why because everybody else is paying high prices you price it against the market might not be as attractive so we'll deal with those as we go through and I can see it's going to be my allergy day already so forgive me for wiping my nose blowing your nose is pretty disgusting into my mic so I'll try not to blow my nose so let's go back to the notes I think we were on page 55. so don't let this page intimidate you so remember the last class I did PE ratios Peg ratios Price to Book ratios EV tablet dot EB to sales right with each one I did the Azure think of this as kind of a cheat sheet of every conceivable multiple so you've got in the top Equity multiples where I start with the dividend discount model tell you the drivers of the equity multiples Enterprise Value multiples that start with an Enterprise Value model work up so it's basically a cheat sheet of everything we did in the last class the drivers of each month today we're going to put the grunt part and we're going to apply because once you've done the defined describe analyze you're in a position to apply so let's say you decide to start your pricing this weekend you have an open weekend I'm not pre-judging it but let's say you have time and say I'm going to do my press what's the first step you got to find comparable companies right and for the last 75 years in Wall Street when you say comparable companies what are you train to do you have a software company you go looking for other software companies you have a steel company you look for other skill companies why do we do that what is it that we do when we what are we implicitly assuming what software is still countries one is where she made the correctly price which is always the case but we're also assuming that they all look roughly the same in terms of growth and Casual risk but cheating right because we don't know how to control all software content is that true 40 years ago it was probably true sectors were homogeneous today you take the software set who's that who's the biggest player you got Microsoft you got Adobe and then you got all these guiding software companies are all part of the sector very different companies so let me suggest and revolutionary idea which is rather than compare Microsoft or the software company should I be comparing it to other companies that look just like it in terms of cash flows growth and risk companies that dominate the sectors of high margins big revenues I would argue that that's closer to a comparable from an intrinsic value stand for than staying without set so today I'm going to talk about tricks you can use to change your definition of comparable so you bring in companies more like yours but no matter how careful you are about defining content but one of the things you're going to face once you've got that list of 15 20 25 or 30 companies is there will be differences between your company and those companies differences are growth difference in cash flow different servers you have to control for those differences right now you know how according research analysts control of those differences they tell stories like what my stock has a PE of 18 the average for the sector is 15. but that's okay because my company is higher growth that's incomplete to many as well you've explained the direction like many of you told me stories about increasing margins but many of you didn't complete your story so you told me your company had a margin of minus five percent it'll improve much he told a really good story of why the margins improve yes but they need a Target margin 20 and you know what part of the story was installed why 20 I can see why you moved from negative to positive but y to 20 percent so when you think about pricing you've got to do the same thing not only do you tell me how as a variable change it's a multiple changes but about how much so let's start with the basic choice so this weekend you say okay I'm going to do pricing you have to find comfortable companies right how many of you and I want to honest answer have Access Capital IQ it doesn't work for you okay so you need to talk to idea about this it should be working is that true for everybody that stopped working for everybody or just for Asia maybe they don't have they don't like her and they've cut it out the I.T system so you're up is it far from just home or is it from here I've completely given up on that so I will email IP and say that seems to be a problem I mean can I mention a few names and they contact you and maybe wipe you out there whatever they do or not included remove the centers but but if you have Capital IQ the night this is the part of the project where it's going to be most necessary why because if you're going to Capital IQ there's a little box that says screen you click on the screen it'll be you could say it'll give you a whole list of criteria what do you want to screen okay I want to screen based on geography I would look at only U.S companies it'll come back with nineteen thousand viewers now obviously you don't want 19 000 companies you can just sample they say I want software companies in the US too big software account it'll come back with 1300 300 and then you say you know what my software company is a large software company the market cap rate is 100 billion I want to market cap greater than 110 is that it it'll come up with a list of 30 software companies market cap rate you have the two which basically create a customized set now your personal cities you want to find companies just like yours right same size in business the more criteria you add the fewer companies are going to come through let's just explain that this morning somebody's running Home Depot or pricing Home Depot and they've got to jump in project and they said they went into Building green debts and Retail they pick the building retail which makes sense and then impact because Home Depot is a big company market cap greater than 200 billion regarded sample size of what you know what this happens that's the one what's it they're going Home Depot this doesn't help you can't compare Home Depot to Home Depot so here's a choice you're going to have to face do you want to Define your criteria to point to find companies just like yours and end up with a small sample are are you willing to accept more differences than end up with a much bigger self which do you think is better small sample of like companies or a bigger sample of companies that might be different right off right it depends on what it it really depends on what you plan to do with that Sam because you're your choice you can eyeball the data and start to say this company looks good this company looks valid that's what you plan to do you want to keep the sample small you know for much of the last century if you're an auto analyst in the U.S you know how big this happens great GM Ford in Christ that's all you had you had history and all order addresses no they immerse themselves into three companies and they develop rules of thumb you know GM trades at a PE ratio 25 higher than Ford and then they would make interesting the price adjustment s so if you're going to just do this eyeballing I wouldn't understand each other keep your sample small otherwise you wouldn't go crazy the second thing you could do is you could make a slightly larger sample and then if there's a difference talk about differences in growth then maybe learn a little bit by looking across eight or nine couples the third choice is you take whatever variable that you're worried about and bring it into your multiple what are you talking about remember PEG ratio I talked about the history of figure issues you can almost see that poor islands in the 1970s working for Peter Lynch and it's been asked to find girl companies sitting there in front of a list of companies with P ratios and growth rates and recognizing very quickly that if you pick companies just based on low B ratios none of the growth companies were coming in ratio because it allowed him to bring growth into the equation but the consequence of course was he created an horrendous multiple in terms of being able to explain it and there's a fortune open up the statistics book we already did last session right when we talked about relations across countries statistics as I mentioned the last match was designed to do exactly this control the difference across companies okay ready I'm going to play the role of a really bad equity research address I'm going to get fired five times in the next 15 minutes I'm gonna fire myself I'm going to give out bad advice your job is to ask me the right questions so the each one I'm going to put up a recommendation and then let you ask me questions because you know the questions you need to ask so I'm the beverages this is my Center long time ago they're beverage companies and I'm a very naive Alex so I put out a buyer recommendation on three companies Andre's wine have you heard of them they produce champagne that's so cheap then watching the commercial for their champagne I think gives you a headache and then comes around Christmas every year you know really cheap champagne dollar for a whole bottle that's like Trader Joe's one dollar one but at least that's breakable this is not a really cheap champagne second is star hunter and the third is hands Todd Hunter have no idea what they even do I think some kind of whiskey that only a few people drink or something like and as a matter of course you've seen the patch surge white MPP string I told you it was a very nice what what made these three Stand Out low B ratios so ask me the questions I've given away the information actually in the next two columns with Andre wine and Todd Hunter why is my PE ratio solo what about and to naturally looks like a good deal right growth is high p is low what's important what's a mismatch it's the third column I've given right there there is risk I miss I mean and that's what I mean about sloppy pricing is often you'll see I am this the data will be staring them in the face and they're still looking at Creations like hey how come you're not looking at growth and risk I'm not saying that you know Hanson could not be cheap but I'm saying you need to control for different growth and risk and by not controlling for them I'm essentially waving my hands and I don't even see how you can make a pricing judgment if you cannot quantify how much growth matters and how much so I get fired at the beverages so I land on my feet I'm the Telecom adrm so let me give you a history of the Telecom business until the 1980s the only Telecom company in the world that was traded was atnt only the US had a traded Telecom the rest of the world telecom companies were governmental the 1980s and 90s many of these telecom companies were privatized in other words they made public companies and many of those companies decide to list in the US and have adrs adrs are basically those companies trading the U.S the nice thing about adrs is your earnings have to be restated using data which is a big deal in that time because you're a different Accounting Standards so there are my there's my sector and there's the peer-ish for each of these numbers I'm still naive that firing didn't cure the knife day so I picked my cheaper stocks I ask you to buy intersat and telegraphs Telegraph of course then was the Brazilian Telecom company since been broken up into seven telecom companies and intercept with the Indonesian Telecom company and this was an immediate aftermath of a crisis in Indonesia in 1996 that caused the entire country the economy in dementia so they look cheap right but I've given you one clue to what you look at the growth rate they have them in the lowest growth rates in the century that's one thing that's the better you know what the other is these are all Telecom adrs but there's a mix of Telecom adrs indicated telegraphs are emerging marketer but you also have the Danish Telecom company the Georgia Telecom company that you have some developed Market telecom companies and this was in an age with emerging markets were really much riskier than development so if you're asking this qualitative question one thing you worry about is the low growth and the other thing you worry about is back that some of these companies are Emerging Market companies which I'm a developer at some point you stop the hand waving and say I've got to do something a little more specific so here's what I did I ran a regressed again a regression is just a tool I have a dependent variable which is PE ratio these companies I'm trying to explain them why differences in growth and whether their emerging market or development marketing companies you know what a dummy bear into this a dummy variable is a variable that takes on a value by the zero or one so I went through my database and them to the Emerging Market Telecom company and put in a one and a developed Market company I put a zero I ran the regression against a girl trade and the Emerging Market dummy vary so let's see what this regression does let's take the constant 13.12 what does that tell me it tells me how the entire sector is being practical sectors being priced higher right now if I did this for AI I'd start with the large intercept with everybody's price tag so it kind of brings that adjusts Within what is this 121.22 coefficient on growth W every one percent increase in growth in this sector increases my PE by 1.21 so if your growth rate is 10 higher than mine that's Telecom company your p e ratio should be roughly 12.1 higher than mine if I trust the market but how would I read this minus 13.85 coefficiently emerging market actually worse the better we have two companies two telecom companies so let's be very clear this is just Telecom specific it's about the sector they have the same girlfriends late 90s but one is an Emerging Market Telecom company the other is a develop Market Telecom company the Emerging Market telecoms companies p is 13.85 not 0.1385 13.85 lower so the first company is a b of 45 the second company is going to have a period of 11.15 what markets are getting Emerging Market If This Were an intrinsic valuation how do we bring in Emerging Markets we do a country risk premium or push up the discount rate think of this as the pricing analog this is what the market is discounting Emerging Market companies for it is your Emerging Market discount now why did I do all of this because I thought telepress was cheap right at 8.9 times earnings well let's go back and plug the numbers for telegraphs into the regression seven and a half percent growth rate Emerging Market company I get a predicted PE of 8.35 was trading at 8.9 times earnings at 8.9 times earnings televised is actually slightly overpriced not under price after I adjust for its low growth and its Emerging Market status same thing with intercepted look cheap but if you bring in it's very low growth in the fact that an Emerging Market company becomes overpriced what I've essentially done is taken the hand waving and said you know what let's use statistics to quantify the effect bring it in and actually look at the present thief in fact it's too high or too long given the growth and given those yes it could be this is all a telecom media so I didn't do a subset of them but if I picked out I think you've raised an interesting question can I take a sample of 19 and make it look better by taking three companies out you're going to be tempted you're gonna because why is your R square know that that's an outlier right you say I take that out I heard jobs don't go there because you take the first outlier out guess what you find a second outlier the third outlier and a fourth outline before you're done you've taken all the things that are explaining differences across companies and ended up with seven companies that look alike so I know and but that often happens right so you don't know what the gaming has been on Data before somebody sells you something but it is susceptible it's I won't call it susceptible it's if you have bias you're going to find a way to bring that bias in by changing your sample or changing your multiples or taking out a variable that push it in the wrong direction like we'll mention that they want to look at us oh that's a different question because I've looked at growth and risk because they're all telecom companies right the big differences for risk are going to be which country you're in right the growth I brought in so the question is there's a missing variable here why did you put in a return in equities of my sample size kind of works against me because I would lay like 18 companies I can't keep throwing variables in I'll give you a general rule the number of independent variables you can have in your regression is going to be a function of how many companies you have in yourself if you have four companies don't even run a regression you know don't show me regression coefficient it's pointless you need at least 10 maybe you can get away maybe nine nine ten if you do a regression with nine or ten companies you can run we're gonna have one independent web you have 20 companies you can have two for every 10 companies in your samples you get a little only weight at variables okay so keep that in mind as you start building these regressions one final point I use the zero one you know why I didn't because a I was lazy and B this was in the late 90s where I did not have continuous measures of countries you know today what I could use instead of that zero one because I could use Lambda but is it but remember when you're in doing pricing you're you don't want to do any work so you want something that somebody gives you I could use a default but even that's too much work for me I'm too lazy to go to a couple of false friends I could use the rating you know but it's an alphabet and stuff to put an alphabet into it remember those PRS there's risk scores we talked about nowhere you can look at you you can get that for 160 countries it's a number you put it in and it'll give you a continuous measure of contributions so today we actually could do things we could not have done across companies in the late 90s to bring in country list but I find this dummy variable concept useful whenever you have something that some of the companies face let's say half your companies regulate other half or under regulated it's a way of capturing what is the effect of regulation on my PE ratios you're in a red State versus a blue State what is the effect of PE ratio depending on which state you operate your business in it's a good way to kind of separate those effects on pricing so telegraphs actually once you plug in the numbers turns out to be overvalued and it's one reason why you want to bring in those other factors so I get fired at the Telecom it's not because I write the regression but because I refuse to run the regression I land on my feet I'm now the European Bank analyst these are my companies in my sample most of them I can't even pronounce and I'm not even going to try but I got the price book ratios you know why people like to use Price to Book ratios for banks what is it about banks that makes their book values more meaning anybody want to travel yes one is that Mark to market right it's one segment where you're supposed to Market to Market so Book value is supposed to be reflected what you have and second is it actually affects your regulatory Capital ratios you can't play games Book value and get away so price the book is often a widely used model so I went with the status quo I'm going to use price to work and when you use Price to Book and this is the advantage of applying after you've done the analysis what's the companion variable what's a variable that drives prices return and Equity so I put up the return Equity because when you did the algebrae remember that popped out in the first It's like got to return it and then I threw in a proxy for risk I threw in the standard deviation in stock prices but in hindsight I wish I'd used a risk measure more specific to banking remember you've left the intrinsic value arena there is no should be could be so you can't talk about betas and the only way of thinking but this is all done so if I were thinking about a risk measure specific to banks that I could use what would you look at what makes some banks let's say you're running this regression today Price to Book of U.S banks versus returning Equity a few aspects what's the thing that worries you what brought svb done what what did they do from what it was actually from treasury Bots from Dubai what they thought was the same thing they bought devons and they bought them they bought 10-year bonds so if I were able to get and I think I can get from s p Capital like I can decide the data what percentage of A bank's assets are in long-term bonds I could throw that in as a risk measure right because that's what is worrying investors now my point is when you think about risk in a sector be creative think about what in this sector people worry about you want to bring in a process so here I'm going to stay with the standard deviation and my initial try I'm going to eyeball it's a very dangerous practice because my eyes start to glaze over after a while but what am I looking for in a cheap Banker I want a low price to book by now you know that you know the prayer I want a higher return Equity low return I return equity and I want low risk so what I did was I computed a median for this error how is that median outfit when you go look for a price to book I want to accompany with a price to book less than the median a return Equity higher than the median and a standard deviation lower or higher in the media lower than the media the closest I could get actually was I think the I thought BNP part of I got two out of the three I got Loper there wasn't a single stock that met all three am I surprised not real there's no unless it's an obvious misprice and if I'm looking for an overvalued stock I'm looking for stocks that are Price to Book ratios higher than the median returns in equity lower than the median and standard deviation higher try that out it's a good starting point for pricing this get the companies in your sector compute the medians and look for companies that fall below or above and look for is it something obviously misplaced the eyeballing though the nothing here looked obviously underpriced obviously overpriced in all three dimensions so again I went back to my statistics rulebook I said look rather than play eyeballing data I'm going to run a regression of what Price to Book ratios or Banks against return and equity and the standard deviation and today if I were running this for Bank the percentage of their assets and long-term bonds good news the coefficients are all in the right direction the reason I keep emphasizing this in a little while I'm going to show you a regression that at least one regression where the sign doesn't fit what you expected it to be it's my negative or positive instead of negative or negative instead of positive we'll talk about why that happens here higher return Equity companies higher price work ratios and riskier companies of lower prices the r squared 79 small sample I'm not going to get Overjoyed but it's still a pretty decent r squared to sample that we have and if you take every Bank in here I can make sense every one percent increase my return Equity increases my Price to Book ratio by 0.0363 every one percent increase in the risk reduces my price book I've Quantified the effects I get predicted Price to Book ratios for all of my contacts so if we take buy a receipt or whatever German banks and names I can't even pronounce the actual price to book ratio is 0.80 the predicted price in book ratio is 0.89 it's slightly overwatched but what is an r squared of 79 percent do I mean where does it play out divided r squared of 100 my predictions will be perfect right with an r squared of 79 that predicted Price to Book is whatever range 0.86 to 0.92 if the r squared where twenty percent the range is going to get bigger so that what I'm trying to say is if you get an r squared of 20 don't give up it doesn't mean you cannot use the regression it just means you'll get a bigger rage the bigger range means you will not be able to reject the hypothesis the stock is correctly but the one thing though that you should do when you run a regression you see those those numbers and brackets although I tested this is just make sure you don't have any noise in your regression by leaving a variable with a t statistic of 0.3 or 0.5 in there because you're ruining a prediction with something that shouldn't even be in there so any questions on the banking exam so I get five as a European bank now so I thought I did a good job but I guess I screwed up and I now have become dising generous they give me the hundred largest market cap stocks they've given up in my capacity look at SEC you know enough about this it's not the cheapest one cheapest stocks 100 largest markets now this is actually a challenge right 100 largest market cap stocks in the in the US have Banks they have technology companies their manufacturing companies and Retail companies all in their needs so I wanted to pick a multiple which I could use across the context when you have financial service companies in the mix you cannot go with any model so already you're constrict because coming up debt and cash for a bag is important so I stayed with an equity Market I decided to stay with priced above companion variable return inputting remember Scatter Plots from statistics I did this character how many how many dots should there be on this schedule 100 so I would like at least one of you to actually count the thoughts for me sometime today and make sure there are 100 I'm not sure no I think there should be a hundred what's this line that throws what is it the best fit line so how do you get the best fit line I'd love to tell you I've got a ruler and I tried different things luckily for me the package any statistics package when you ask for a scatter part even Excel as you do want me to fit a bit just say yes even if you have no idea what it's going to fit it's a regression line it's been progressively yeah what are those two outside lines the confidence intervals right if the r squared were a hundred the there'd be only one line as so this is a good way to visualize what a low r squared is doing is the lower the r squared the bigger the band it's going to be notice that most of the 100 companies fall between the two lines will determine statistically I cannot reject the hypothesis that those stocks are correctly pressed there are three stocks that fall above the land others my most overpriced stocks the most underpriced books what do you think most overpriced stocks I'm going to read the names of the three and you tell me whether they share anything in common because it might give me a clue as to what I'm missing in this character the three most overpriced stocks are Google Infosys and Gilead you have a pharmacy to become so whenever you see three companies we see a common character the reason you look is maybe there's a missing variable that's why they look cheap what do they share in common they're high growth companies right remember Price to Book is driven by return Equity but it's also driven by growth and risk and by not controlling for growth companies with high growth may look overpriced to me but it's because I haven't packed it in the problem what about the three companies below the line and I and I'll explain what they are Chronicle Phillips Exxon Mobil and Nokia you know by this point in time 2010 I had no idea what kind of company it was the smartphone business was dead I don't know what business they were in Conoco Phillips election mobile two big oil companies red flags should go off already you know why they looked underpriced because Royal companies are using return Equity I'm using last year's net income and 2010 happened to be a net income it bounced back they returned an equity had gone up but markets were not being stupid and pricing them based on that net income you said why did you even waste your time at the scatter plot I'm going to explain a way that was pressing in the country you're not going to find some massively mispriced stock in there that's heavily forward heavily invested in but if I did this with hundreds small cap stocks or 100 stocks in a market like Peru but there might not be a lot of investors following a lot who knows you might find a significant Mis price but that was my first step here I rather but if you are worried about the fact that growth is missing and you say can I bring it in I can but you're not going to like the picture it's got the three-dimensional scatter part and they make me this whenever I look you got Price to Book return equity and growth it's like a think of it like a cardboard box right I want you to tell me where in this box your cheapest stocks can be fine I'll help you you want low price to book a high price and you want low return Equity High return so you want low price to book High return equity and hydro so this is where you're looking I have some bad news there's nothing there the closest I get is actually time one remember the closer you get the more so in a sense when you run three-dimensional graphs the first step is for yourself noticing where the cheap stock should be and then looking to see what's closest that's your cheapest one to be honest what are the visual people everything has to be in charge you can try scatterbox I at some point in time I just I just give up on this I know I have no idea how time one is the closest this is the so I'll give you a much more I think pragmatic way of doing this what's the most you can fit into the scatter plot I think three dimensions are about all you can feel it I've never seen a four dimensional graph actually I have in fact the way they did was they drew a dozen three-dimensional graphs a bit different so it actually is like this this this 12 different three-dimensional graphs they're very pretty but I have no idea how to use them actually but if I could do three-dimensional graphs I could break risk into right I want low risk so in a sense you can pick your three variables and do it but if you want to go beyond three variables your kind of stuff right if you do gravity just what I did instead I decided to run a regression figure one trick pointing keep writing regressions I go there because at the end of the process what else am I going to do I add Price to Book ratios by dependent variables beta growth and return Equity everyone read out the coefficients the first thing I wanted to check is are the signs going in the right direction ayurveda stocks have lower price to book ratios make sense that makes sense higher growth stocks have higher price democrations and higher return Equity stocks so he decides relief these designs are right next up check to see whether the variables statistically explain much go to the T statistics and basically as you look across the T statistic return Equity dominant variable second best growth and then when you look at the coefficient for beta notice that it's 0.2 says I left beta India because I wanted to bring home this point if I would actually rerun this regression I would take beta out of the regression because it's adding noise will it affect the r squared very very much because the D statistic of the r squared are connected at the hip you take out a low T statistic variable you'll get a much more usable and much better regression by taking those coefficients part of you would say but it should matter what should matter doesn't really matter when you're doing pricing it's not what you should if you think should belong there it's based on what the Market's actually pricing and if I use this regression I could get a predicted Price to Book ratio every single company I usually update these um these hundred largest market cap regressions every industry I'll be too lazy to do it I should do it someday soon but this was my 2022 update notice something about the range in this looks like a huge range right almost nothing Falls outside the range and why is the rage so much bigger in 2022 than in 2010. the R square is so for whatever reason in 2022 that it's not something that's happened over time it goes up and down by from you so that's what I meant about low R squares and higher R squares rather than thinking about them as good or bad things the way they show up is As Much wider range slower squares makes it more difficult to find something that's underpriced or overpriced enough to fall outside the range so I get fired it's a market 100 largest market cap company so I thought I did a good job but I guess they would like it and they put me so now they're moving me to more and more boring sectors this is their version of punishment so they moved me to becoming analyst for the truck himself I can't get any invest in this starting from the sector and now they asked me to use Evita have been done because that's what we use and I come back with a buyer recommendation after all I've done this before being fired before why not get fired again so I said no initially I was going to put out kllm transportation services but I have no idea who they are or where they are and I've heard about them and I'm too lazy to look it up topic writer systems you know why because I once saw a truck go by and it's Rider on the side and I know what they do they rent out of trucks they look cheap 2.8 times that but remember the rule of thumb is six times this should make a private Equity investor drool with joy right this is about as cheap as it gets so I put out a buyer recommendation by bright assistant with trades and 2.8 times you're going to play devil said ask me the questions we saw what droved right you remember the variables so what Yuki tax rates of so the question is what's your tax rate if I totally write a system with an 80 tax rate and everybody else has 20 that would explain it away in this case it turns out they're all U.S companies roughly so let's take that off put the next you would go ahead when it comes to reinvestment rate first because that's the right field you know we can go cost to Capital all you want if there will be variety systems where a Venezuelan trucking company that might explain it wasn't that the growth and all mature companies then we get to the reinvestment and I have to fill in some I have to give you some backstory on how trucking companies reinvest trucking companies replace their entire flees every five six or seven years why do they do that because they get much better discounts when they replace the entire fleet rather than the pieces so rather than ask me what the reinvestment rate is Sophia what's the question you're going to ask me about right assist given this this way of doing this or how old is my fleet directly and that would have settled the problem because it turned out that Rider systems are the oldest thing so what it looks see you go buy the stock four weeks later I'll predict what's going to happen you're going to wake up toward Wall Street Journal story that ride assistance is just borrowed five billion dollars to buy new trucks that was 2.82 the minute they do that will become six times that because remember that that will now become part of your best Gap this actually I pulled off an actual self-site equity research performance it put a buy recommendation private systems and they've done it entirely the Evita I went and collected the age of every Trucking company's Fleet and added to the Excel spreadsheet that's all I did and the minute you did that it jumped at it that's what I mean about sloppy pricing I have no problem with using EV Toyota but at least have the good sense to control for the differences and ask the right questions because then I can buy into a price so after my ill-fated writer systems recommendation I get tried again what's even more boring than trucking companies grocery stores anybody value the grocery store what's the growth rate look like for a U.S grocery store three percent four percent even fat people have leveled off right they're not eating more do you need change in food and the people are dieting it's bad news for you what kind of margins do grocery stores have two three percent what kind of store are you going to tell for a grocery the kind of story that puts people to sleep so no growth low margin business where people buy things they need every day Glory but it fits right so I took the grocery store business I took all the grocery stores put up a scatter plot and guess what most of them behaved very well they fit in between the two lines and there is this outlier you know what that is that's the first coming of Whole Foods kind of blue grocery store analyst mines right because here was a grocery store where they charged four times as much for eggplant and I offered you food said you know you felt Rich you bought and you didn't feel rich you basically looked and said oh my God I can't buy that yeah it's a high margin grocery store never never been seen in the US before and it threw Atlas off so I remember looking at Whole Foods and equity research analyst you know saw that it traded a much higher multiple of revenues and I use price to sales I should have used Evita sales to be quite honest but I stayed in price because that's what they were using and they gave a story they said it's okay it's okay you know it's okay because the price had gone up but it's trying to get a high multiple because it is a higher margin which is true it has a higher margin but does that justify trading at one point five times Revenue so here's what I did I ran a regression of price to sales against net margins but just grocery stores plugged in Whole Foods much 3.4 Which is higher than the industry average and got a predicted price to sales of 0.43 what does that mean even after I control for its higher margin it should be trading at 0.43 times revenues it's trading at 1.9 times revenues no surprise even with the margins then I lost interest in Whole Foods I tend to lose interest quickly in these things a year later I Revisited the sector and I did a scatter plot I looked above the line expecting to see Whole Foods up at the top and guess what it is it was the most underpriced stock in the sacred gone from what had happened in the intervening years they'd had a bad earnings report people had kind of sold everything because they basically didn't understand the company that pushed the price down went from being the most overpriced grocery store to the most underpriced grocery store I said that's interesting and I came back in 2010. and Garrett is back again above the line it's like watching a manic depressive in action right you need some mood swings kind of adjuster somewhere in there but that's what happens when you get a new player in a business and people don't understand it they don't get it right they overshoot they undershoot they overshoot they undershoot I actually tracked Whole Foods through 2013 and 2013 it fell right on the line they said okay finally they get they know what to do with the company it takes a while to think of Tesla right what Auto analyst had ever seen a company like Tesla they still can't figure it out takes a long time to adjust because you think in metrics you were used to given what the sector looked like and now you have the players playing a very different game so in 2013 finally people had figured Whole Foods you think back to boring grocery business 2015 I took a brief Glimpse again at the grocery business and then you there's a new kid in town you know what that what you've ever heard of sprout Sprouts is a West Coast base it's like a you know it's like a hippie version of Whole Foods you know that's I mean it used to be a store called Henry's we had big bins you could get food out of so they're like you know you don't like Whole Foods because you feel it's full of yuppies you can come to Sprouts and you can spend a lot of money and still feel like you're one of the common people it's it's a store designed for Berkeley people you can say that's you know that's basically what it is I taught at Berkeley for two years I love the place but it's full of people that you don't want to hang out too long with because like you've contaminated along the way right yeah but again it's a store that people didn't understand and you can see it starting at the top I I should track Sprouts to see what's happened over time but maybe eight years later it's now right down towards the line so take sectors where there's a new player entering who's different from everybody else and you're going to see this pricing mispricing kind of layout how many of you are having Young Money losing companies I think of uber it's still young it's money losing so quite a few of You Are talk till now I've given you all these nice pictures but things fit and you put in the right variables you get an r squared that's reasonable you can make predictions I'm going to get you ready for a scenario which is going to make you very unhappy remember when I valued Amazon in 2000 I found it overvalued.com stock I decided to do a pricing of Amazon at the same time so I said I want to do a pricing how different different and I knew the only multiple I could use was Revenue markets right so I used to price to sales again in hindsight I should have used EB to sales and I said I know price would sales is explained by net margin so I'm going to throw in price to sales versus Net margin to a scatter plot and this is what I saw in my stomach dropped what does that look like a shotgun blast right I mean if I ask you can you fit a line it you're saying I have no idea what the line is like and if I ran a regression of price to sales against net margin you know what kind of r squared I'm going to get right undaunted I ran the regression anyway and I wasn't surprised the r squared I got was four percent but he isn't even scarier number see that coefficient on that margin minus 7.54 how would I read that the more negative your net margin the higher your price to sales ratio now some.com companies took that to heart right you lost a billion we can lose two you lose one we can lose four because it looked like the mark but even bubble markets are not crazy and the other reason this regression is not working no person in their right mind was pricing a.com company based on how much money it made last year right so when you invest in these companies what are you basing the pricing on what do you expect them to do in the future how much are they going to grow what margins are they going to make and I'm actually running a regression against last year of course I'm going to get 0 R square so for some of you this is going to happen if you're running an AI company a cloud company run this you know run the scatter plot English it's not going to work so two tricks I'm going to pull out of my back pocket my front pocket or whichever pocket and you can use either one and see if it works for you the first is to think about what investors in this sector think about when their price companies and I'll give you what my my thought process.com companies people who are buying.com companies because they wanted growth so I said I want to focus on Revenue growth High Revenue growth companies should be priced at should have higher price price to sales ratios than low Revenue growth the Great second I hypothesized that as companies got bigger the price to sales ratio will have to come down why because if you're a million dollar company trading at 100 times revenues is not a big deal but if you're a billion dollar company that becomes much more difficult the third is when you're investing in these young startups you know many of them will not make it so the higher the chance a company will not make it the lower the price to sales ratio and that's the regression I ran I took log of revenues to capture how big the revenues were saying bigger companies should trade at lower multiples of revenues I took Revenue growth saying higher Revenue growth companies should have higher multiples and finally I looked at cash as a percent of Revenue system what's that capture you think about how young companies fare it's not because they can't make a debt payment it's because they run out of cash so my argument was the more cash a company has on on hand the less likely it is to fail in fact equity research analysts in the.com area used to measure what's called a cash burn time period how many months of cash do you have arguing that the more months of cash you have the greater the chance of survival the random aggression good news is the signs are all consistent as Revenue score price to sales ratios come down as Revenue growth goes up price to sales goes up and the more cash companies have the higher the price of saturations take a look at the T statistics you know if I were doing this right which which of the variables should I take out of this regression log revenues you know as much as I'd like to hypothe marketing seem to care I no I'm going to leave it in there but if I rerun it I take it out I took Amazon's numbers and plugged them into this regression predicted so I plugged in Amazon's revenues Amazon's growth rate Amazon's cash is a percentage and I got a predicted price to sales ratio perams on a 30.42 it was actually trading at 25.6 times revenues based on my pricing what am I finding for Amazon that it is underpriced and this was it on exactly the same day I ran this on the same day I did my remember the DCF valuation I did of Amazon but I found it to be valued at 35 stock was trading at 84. I'm going to make what sounds like an incredibly contradictory statement but I think both parts of the statement are true in January 2000 we asked me about Amazon I'd have said it's overvalued and underpressed I'm not looking for Vindication but a year later I've been right on both counts right what happened to the stock price it went from 84 to 11. that's about an 80 drop in the stock price but it dropped only 80 percent he said what do you mean only 80 you know what happened to the rest of the.com sector it dropped 95 so the pricing was right I was telling you you found the cheapest of these stocks and so was the valuation but that's something you need to remember when you do pricing when you find something to be underpriced you're just finding an underpriced relative to the other companies you're comparing it to and Vindication for you might be that you lost early 50 and everybody else lost 75 percent so that's the pricing value of Disconnect so that's the first way to deal with young companies is to bring in variables that you think reflect the pricing just a second you know what the biggest problem with pricing small undeveloped competitions I mean let's say again how much revenues does your company have they said zero no multiple is going to work for it right anything divided by zero is going to blow up you have no earnings no cash flows so when you have nothing of substance right now you need to find something of substance so what can you do go into a future year you remember you project out revenues and earnings and all that neat stuff in your DCF you're not doing a DCR but you say I'll take my revenues in your debt or your five when I have a bigger revenue and rather than applying a multiple today's revenues I'm going to apply a multiple to year five or year 10 repage the neat trick right you take the 10 billion in revenues you have in your your 10 you apply it eight times revenue or five times Revenue you get 50 billion as your it's called a forward pricing I'm going to add a note of caution what do you see in that forward pricing you've got to convert into a pricing today right because you're paying for the stock today and there's going to be many a slip between the cup and the lip what looks like a big number and a forward price you can start to slip away when you bring it today why let's start at the obvious reason if I get an 80 billion dollar pricing in your debt what's the first adjustment I need to make to bring it through pricing today the time value of money right so I could do take a risk-free rate and discount but there's also risk so a discount back at the cost of capital I've adjusted for both inflation and risk the 80 billion is going to become 25. it's a risky company and that effect is going to be large what else could could affect my value today to get to get that 80 billion dollar pricing what has to happen the company has to live to your 10 right if there's a 30 chance of failure that's got to be factored that's going to lower the value as well so I've got to just put time value of money you've got adjustment risk I've got it just for failure risk and finally if I have lots of negative cash flows in years one two three four and five which is almost a given what do I need to do I need to issue fresh equity which is going to dilute my holding which also will lower my value today I remember when I first valued uh Tesla I got a lot of pushback not about the valuation itself but about the fact that there was a terminal value of 69 billion and the value that I was giving the company was 8 billion today he said what happened how did the 69 billion become 8 billion so I actually took my 69 billion and broke it down into how it became eight bill so the first thing I did was I took the cash flows discount in the back of the risk free rate and that takes out the time value effect and I discounted with the risk premium built in the cost to Capital brought it down even more then I brought it down for the dilution and by the time this was all said and done I said look 69 billion in year 10 even if you believe that will be worth only 8 billion today because you got to just for all these factors a lot of analysts I see especially in young sectors use forward price they use it without almost thinking through the consequences of what do I need to control to get there because lots of things that can drain back as you go along any questions on forward pricing so I have no problem with you using forward pricing to price your company because there's nothing of substance today but once you get the forward pricing think about the adjustments you will need to make and many of those adjustments or adjustments we had to make when we did discounted cash flow language ultimately in price you got to be friends right the question you're asking is not what should drive the pricing but what is driving the price I don't want to be mysterious but we come into this preconceptions especially from the intrinsic value work price earnings ratio should be higher for high growth companies it should be lower for riskier companies But ultimately the market might care about none of that stuff it'd be pricing something else into the company this is where things like market value per user market value per subscriber market value print.com you know per you know whatever it is come into play because often intrinsic value people dismiss it they say that makes no sense why would you price a company based on users why not that's what the market cares about in 2013 Twitter went public and I valued at the time of its IPO in fact I I reproduced that valuation last year when Elon took over Twitter so you can actually see my 2013 discounted cash flow valuations it came up with the 18 per share at the same time I wanted to price Twitter so I went and looked up social media companies that made their money from online advertising because that I defined as my computer group those are the companies who are publicly traded there are the market caps and Enterprise rappers and then I collected a bunch of accounting data by these companies what are your revenues your revital your debit your net income and I also collected the number of users each of these social media platforms have you can actually find this online there are sites that actually track the number of users I was completely agnostic I said I want to figure out why the market is attaching high prices to some companies in low price I want to see what drives Market gets these companies so that's my end game of the market capsule companies have all these variables what's my starting point how would I figure out what the market is pricing in the most what should I do I run a correlation matrix it's kind of a very simple tool basically I took all my variables and tell me what's correlated what else hey take a look at the first call the higher the correlation the more the market is factoring that in what's the biggest variable driving market cap there you go a number of users same thing with Enterprise Value now you and I can say look that doesn't make sense you'd be focusing on cash flows it doesn't matter that's what the market is pricing in that's what you got to play in 2013 social media companies were being priced based on the number of users and you know how this played out right if you're a BC you're building a social media company what are you going to encourage the entrepreneur to try to guess get more users I'm not going to blame them for doing it because guess who's speeding this frenzy investors who price companies based on users will create VC to encourage entrepreneurs to build up the user base and 10 years later you can pick up the debris of companies that are great user building machines but terrible at monetizing those users so here's how I price Twitter I went back to the previous page and I completed the app so I completed the EV divided by using so EV per use for each company the median value was about a hundred dollars per user across these companies why is the the number of area across companies it's like a market estimate of lifetime value of a user maybe some companies get more value than others Twitter at 240 million users on the day it went perfect let's do a pricing how much is the user Worth to the market a hundred dollars right 240 dollars times 100 is 24 billion dollars okay that's my price you see that is so simplistic guilty as charge but you know what when it went public that's exactly the pricing that Twitter went public around 24 billion pricing is incredibly powerful at explaining what you get for something at a point in time it might not be great to make try to make money on it over time but that's what your job is to price companies you know you look for what drives price so the last segment of what I want to do in this section let's talk a little bit about why do we stay sector focused because once you could do regressions you can control for differences in growth then risk it payout no why can't I compare a company to every company in the market what do you gain by doing it you get a much bigger sample what do I lose by doing it I have a lot more different companies in myself so about starting about 25 years ago at the start of every year when I collected my data I ran a regression of price earnings ratios against growth payout and made it pretty much every multiple across the entire month so I'm going to start with the chart I always do this and I run this chart first because it brings my expectations down dramatically when I look at Price earnings ratios I know the variable that should matter the most is growth right so I run a scatter plot of price earnings versus growth against the market you see why it breaks my expectations aren't and I don't even know what to describe that as a big lump in the middle I have no idea no maybe if I took the outliers out of the princess you know when I look at this this graph and this is the most powerful variable explaining PE ratio I know when I run my regression I'm not going to see 80 r squared to 70 r squared or even 50 R squares I get a 25 I would actually pleasantly surprised by this 25 r squared because after that plot I said maybe 12 maybe 15 25 is pretty good am I disappointed it's not my weapon of choice in the first place what did I want to do I want to do a discounted cash flow evaluation you kept talking about p e ratios I said okay you want to use p e ratios here's a mirror that I want to hold up in front of you so you can see how badly it works let's take the regression apart though the constant is 8.63 what does that tell me that's a base from which I'm going to build off if the P for the market Rises that base is going to get higher that's the starting second every one percent increase in growth increases my PE by Point does that make sense higher growth companies have higher p no in a rough measure that's a price of growth in the market that's how much the market is willing to pay for higher growth companies then I look at beta every increase in beta 1 increases my P by 2.23 that makes sense I beta companies have what high-risk companies should have lower PE ratios right don't do anything selling like what say I don't like the sign I'll make that a minus it doesn't work that way okay we'll talk about why you're getting the wrong side it is what it is right higher beta company is a higher p ratio and finally on payout every one percent increase in the payout ratio increases might be that makes sense it's more efficient growth r squared is 25 as I said I'm not disappointed I'm not pleased what does it mean my predicted PE that comes out of this regression is going to have a much wider range but I want to spend a few minutes on basic statistics so if your statistics is really strong and you find this insulting you're welcome to leave the room when I run a regression this is a regression to linear regression right you know what I mean by linear regression you write any regression if you don't do anything it'll be a linear regression so every one percent increase in growth has the same effect as you go one to two two to three so the first thing you worry about are non-linear relationships now at the moment it's an abstraction but with each multiple I'm going to talk about varnish what is p and growth it's not a big deal but with PEG ratios it's something I'm going to have to deal with what do you do with non-linear relationships there are non-linear regressions you can run where instead of fitting a straight line the line kind of bends it's kind of neat to look at it much more difficult to use to do not so that's the first thing the second is non-stationary what does that mean I ran this regression on January 5th of 2023 can I still use it today the price company and I'm gonna let you do it but you know what things change in this regression the coefficient I've run this regression every year for 25 years I can show you the coefficients over time the variables stayed the same but the coefficient shift that's the non-stationary the relationship between pricing and growth and pricing and risk and pricing and payout change over time which makes it difficult to keep using regressions without rerun and there's a third issue and this might be something you remember or don't remember from your statistic class depending on how much you enjoyed it I did not enjoy it it's what called multi-collinearity I remember listening to that night what the heck is that why should I care I should have cared more multicolinarity talks about the fact that when you run a multiple regression the independent variables are supposed to be independent of each other they're supposed to be unquote every child what are my three independent variables growth beta and payout there isn't a snowball's chance in hell that they can't be correlated with each other right because if you take high growth companies they tend to have low payout ratios and higher valence the thing I can do in fact I can't find any three variables in finance that are encore but because they're all driven by the same companies we'll come back and talk about what to do with multicollinearity but something that might explain some of the strange output we get from this regression coefficient right what if high high growth companies have high betas and that that tends to be true what does the computer see when you give it data you might label the data whatever but it sees four Columns of numbers right so if all your high growth companies have high betas are you can you blame the computer for getting confused about what beta is measuring in that regression the way to explain the positive coefficient on beta is beta is starting to act as a proxy for growth instead of a proxy for risk which is one reason you think that we talk about what to do as I said in a minute but that's the ration now I just I've been talking about these statistics with these regressions of course you need to check these statistics to make sure they're significant so now you know the rules it's nice to have a key statistic higher than two but between one and two you might but if you have t suggesting 0.6.5.3 let's get rid of it it's creating noise in your prediction it's not worth leaving it one final point if you run a traditional regression whether it's in Excel or whether it's in many cab you're in the statistics package that they have I don't know which package is that you run the traditional regression it runs it with a constant an intercept and if you get a negative intercept which you can it can become a problem if you're using it in pricing let's talk about what let's say your intercept is minus 10 which is completely plausible what do you do you take the minus 10 and then you add adjust for p integral then the risk but what if after all the adjustments you end up with a negative predicted value P ratios can't be negative right so you're ending up with numbers that can't be used the thing is there a fix no every statistics package I've ever seen including excel's old package when you run a regression it asks you a question do you want a constant in your regression that's the default it leaves a constant but you can also pick a default where you take the constant dot what it does is it moves remember that best fit line it moves it to go through the origin in other words through zero it's not as good a fit anymore because you move the light but you no longer have a negative intercept problem essentially when we run that intercept less regression the regression output will look like this so this is my PE regression for 2023 without the intercept and basically it's still the same three variables I can compute at least you can use it just like a regular regression without this issue of having a negative interest I didn't have to do this in 2023 because the intercept was positive but I think this was from 2019 when I had a negative intercept I had to re-run the regression and remove it because I was getting too many predicted negative PE ratios which I did not want question it's it's the day basically it remember it's the best fit line so if you get the the the scatter plot moved in a particular direction remember the line just get spit through it so just a function of the data and that you're and what cause so there's no real fundamental reason the data just has to get skewed and intercepts intercept can get Negative this this year I think out of the six regions of the world that I ran the regression for two at negative intercepts there's nothing I could point to that said this is why it was but for those reasons the reasons I reread their regression without the constitute and finally there's a multiple linearity this is actually what's called a correlation Matrix I took the independent variable and the dependent variables put them on see these beta growth and payout If This Were a perfect regression beta payout and growth should have zero correlations with each other that's what told them you can see already that they're not zero correlations right beta and growth are positively correlated growth and pay are the negatively correlated it's a it's a fact of life are there statistical fixes yes and If This Were A statistics class we could go to four sessions on how do you think I'm not interested here's what when you get multicollinearity it makes your coefficients behave in strange ways like in the beta gifts in a positive and certain negative but you could still use the regression to get predicted values and that's all I care about I want to use the regression to get predicted PE ratios so I've never felt the urge to fix that but if you're a statistics key and this is what makes you dig there are ways you can get around that so I'm going to close off by using this regression to make a prediction I mean the whole point of running this Market regression was I wanted to use it to make predictions start the market regression I ran for the US I plugged in the numbers for this at the start of 2022 they're buried at their growth rate I get a predicted PE for this 21.43 with a cabinet the r squared is only 25 so there's probably a range of like 6 14 to 27 Big Range because they are square Disney's actual PE was 31 .38 I think it was 31.36 so what does it make this need to be relative to the market how would I how would I describe the output for the conclusions I would get from this regression Disney is overpriced complete the sentence so overpriced you always said relative to the market after adjusting for growth risk and payout what am I going to do about it I don't plan to do anything but if I ran a hedge fund and I built it around this regression you know what I would do I would sell short the overpriced stocks and buy the Enterprise stocks and get our Minis and hope and pray that they all move towards a regression line because then I'm going to make money so if you want to start a hedge fund over this weekend be my guest but you have the tools to do it if you want I'll see you on Monday okay thank you 
foreign thank you thank you here anymore thank you okay does anybody know who's water bottles this is I tell you why I care it's actually on top of where I keep the quizzes so whoever was looking for a quiz left it behind before I throw it in the trash I want to make sure it's not a price possession I started to make sense of all the things stuck on it it's yours like my five-year-old if I gave him a water bottle would do this but enough Okay so before I start today okay nothing is very very quick announcements your think again like this this whatever it is so like that you have to go like a duck face so you got to do that okay whatever first your final exam dates are set by the university they said later than everybody else I think I think the official final exam date is that Friday which is the 12th okay so I want to make sure everybody is clear about that book and apparently so we started two and go through 3 50 p.m don't ask me why the university has these strange timings I guess they need the rooms it's an hour and 50 minutes long so it is you know so I just wanted to get that date on your calendar in case you completely forgot there's a final exam your project is due for the start of that week on May 8th what I'm trying to nag you in a very indirect way is this is your last weekend of Grace and then everything's going to hit the fan right next weekend is the final the weekend before quiz three and then the weekend after that you got so if you are really bad you shouldn't be on the project really behind if you've turned into your DCF but if you did not turn into your DCF this might be the weekend you need to get it done and I know I've always said this is the last time this is the very last time if you really get it done this weekend and you want me to give you feedback I will but after this it's not even a question last time you're just running out of time you know it's very close yet so just wanted to make that clear before we started today we're going to actually talk about valuing businesses as a collection of pieces okay let's see what are you talking about hey let's say Coca-Cola since 72 different countries it's on five different continents could I value Coca-Cola as geographically taking each part of the world they're in and valuing that part so take a Asia take North America take Latin America could I do that what's the advantage of breaking up business down into pieces and valuing each piece separately what do you benefit from new to that you sure you can attach different dress if you're afraid you can even do each region in a different currency right so you could value the Indian business and repeat the Japanese business in Yen you can have different growth rates different cash flows so you could treat each one separately and in theory you should get a more precise valuation because you are being more discriminating so what we do it all the time deep so let's do Geographic let's read by continent five continents the question is but remember we need a weighted average what are you assuming about the weights they are going to stay the same so if Asia's growing quickly and North America is growing slowly your weights are going to be off so but to Value Coca-Cola Asia what do I need in terms of information I need an income statement for Coca-Cola depreciation working capital what I'm trying to say the reason we don't do it is because we really don't have the information to do it even if we had the energy and the willingness to do it but today we're going to talk about exceptions where we actually take the effort to try to value a business based on its pieces and come up with What's called the sum of the parts valuation of a company and then we're going to compare that some of the parts valuation to what we got as evaluation of the company as a Consolidated company so I have a more general question if I do a sum of the parts valuation of a company and I do an intrinsic valuation the whole company and I do them both right should I get the same value assuming I do both right of course if I do wrong then I'll or are they conditioned on which where if you do a sum of the parts valuation you could actually get a different value for the company and if so what might cause the value to be different I want to think about that because today I'm going to Value companies some of the parts and then we're going to talk about what are the conditions under which is some of the parts valuation can yield a number higher you say why should I care let's say the sum of the parts valuation of Sony is greater than the value of Sony as as a Consolidated company is there an action that comes out of that that you could take as an activist what would you do you'd break up the company so when we talk about breaking up companies and splitting up companies and spinning off businesses it's in response the fact that we think there's a contamination effect that's happening here or a management effect that these companies or business will be worth more as physics what did Alibaba do a few weeks ago they put up into six different businesses in the case of Alibaba why do they think they can be worth more as six businesses than as one Consolidated company foreign until 2019 the Chinese government was viewed as an ally to Alibaba and tencent and JD and the big tech companies right Ally in what sense that they competed against an Amazon the Chinese government at least indirectly would pull for them over the competition 2019 though there seemed to be a shift in that perception it was based on the fact that the Chinese government decided in 2019 that these tech companies had become too big and we could talk about why that realization came then and all of a sudden they went the Chinese government went from being an Allied to an adversary and ever since Alibaba and tencent and jdfc that prices not just collapsed but stay low I don't know what the motives for the Alibaba break up but one could be that by making themselves into six small businesses they make themselves less of a concern to the Chinese government saying look we're smaller now we can't compete for control with you but there are lots of reasons why businesses break up but one of the things we're going to examine today is how we come up with some of the parts evaluate incidentally and has used his word all the time in fact they've created an acronym they create acronyms for everything the sotp first time I started what the heck are you talking about sotp stands for some of the parts valuation and we'll see why in the words of analysts they're really not doing valuation they're often doing pricing rather than valuation so let's turn back to the last few vestiges of of pricing that we're talking about I think resume session you remember the last session we were talking about running a regression across the entire Market I took the p e ratio ran a regression against beta payout and growth and I got a coefficient on the growth rate now let me go back to the regression so you can see what I'm talking about the coefficient of the growth rate is 0.462 how would I read that for every one percent increase in growth rate my p e ratio increases by 0.46 but think of that as the price that the market is willing to pay for higher growth a few weeks ago when we were talking about Equity risk creams I described it as the price of risk in the market that's how much the market is penalizing you for being a risky company the higher the equity risk premium the higher the price so with two numbers here one is the price of growth and the other is the price of risk and I brought them both together in this graph so focus on the bottom two so there's the Erp that's the price of risk the growth coefficient regression is what the market is willing to pay for growth so in 2000 the equity risk premium was at two percent that was the peak of the dot combo so Market's not charging much for risk it's paying 2.11 for every one percent of growth it's paying a high price for growth severe a high growth high risk company this is about as good as it gets right you're not being punished for being risky you're being paid this huge premium for growth you're going to trade at 250 time zones at the start of 2023 the equity risk agreement was close to six percent the price of risk has gone up and what the market is willing to pay for growth has gone down now either a same high growth high-risk company you're facing the worst of circumstances you're being punished a lot for risk and not getting much of a benefit from growth and that's where we were at the start of 2023. in the last three months one of the things I've seen in markets is that the growth growth seems to have made a comeback in other words when I if I ran this regression that I ran three months ago today my guess is the coefficient and growth is going to have gone up from 0.46 to a higher number but I want you to track that number over time because it's going to tell you something about what is the market charging for investing in Risky companies and what is it willing to pay for higher growth companies so that's a PE race discussion question it's always expected growth so I use analyst estimates of expected growth over the next five years if you did not have that you could use historical growth not because you want to use historical growth but because you assume historical growth is a good predictor of future growth so growth is always forward-looking but if you don't have estimates of forward growth you're often stuck using historical growth now I'm going to do one more multiple of the market thing just to illustrate a statistical point remember how I started my price earnings regression I ran I did a scatter plot of price earnings against growth why do I want to do that I wanted to see how strong the relationship was and I also wanted to check to see the Assumption of linearity help because I'm going to run a linear regression so I took the PEG ratio the price earnings growth and did a scatter plot against growth again it looks like a shortcut Blaster it's all over the place now you could try to figure out whether it's linear but I give up I don't know what this line is so if any of you have your statistic I use SPSS but I know many tab has the same feature there's a test for linearity you can run so when you do a scatter plot you can run that test and I ran the test and it said this is not linear it's non-linear now there are entire books about what to do when you have a non-linear relationship but I'll give you the quick and dirty trick that seems to work 95 percent of the time in finance I took the natural log of the growth rate you know the natural log is they're a bunch of log buttons on your calculator big log small log base 10 this is the small Ln it's a natural law I don't know why but it works magically well when I did the natural log this is what the scatter plot looks like and then when I did the linearity test it looked it looked like the relationship was more linear I sent a link to my statistics mini course that I have online but you don't have to watch entire course I think there's one session on regression so if you get if you want to watch it you can see that you could I take you through the test for linearity so you can see make sure that when you run a regression you're not forcing a linear regression on something that's non-linear this is pretty close to linear now with the log around the regression now of PEG ratio against log of growth beta and payout ratio first the r squares are much better on the PEG ratio regression than on the p e ratio regression right 55.6 percent I think the PE Ratio is like 20 percent the coefficients tell an interesting story remember I told you why analysts invented the PEG ratio because they wanted to make growth go away right if growth truly went away you know what the coefficient on growth should be it should be zero or pretty close to zero in fact growth not only remains significant it's become even more significant with PEG ratio just change direction higher growth rate companies have lower Peg ratios at least across the market whereas with PE ratios we got the opposite relationship so if nothing else it tells you when you expect ratios you still have to think about growth you just have to remember that higher growth companies now will have lower ped ratios the next six pages I'm just going to put them up simply because they're going to be useful when you do your project one part of your project in case you've not looked at it for a while is to actually price your company relative to the market so one part is price your company against the sector where I ask you to do the work yourself right pull up 15 companies pick a multiple do the pricing but I also ask you to price your company against the market and I don't expect you to run Market regressions in fact I don't want you to be running Market regressions this is not a good use of your time if you want to do it do it after the class is done and you have while I think you still have access to Capital IQ for like a month after just download the data put it on your on your computer and get to it when you get a chance you're welcome to use one of my market regressions you said which one it first depends on multiples I have these regressions for six multiples I have price earnings ratios Peg ratios Price to Book EB debit EB to sales and EV to investor Capital so you click any one of these six are these regressions across five regions of the word U.S companies European companies Japanese companies Emerging Market companies Australia New Zealand and Canada and I also have a global regression of all companies listed globally so if you have a US company you want to run the you want a price against Market pick your multiple take the US regression plug the numbers into your company just make sure you're plugging in the numbers as I've used them so for instance when I did p e ratios I beta growth in non-expression pair the growth I used was the expected growth over the next five years get as close to that as you can get either from your own DCF or you've used a growth rate or from an analyst projection the beta can be either regression or a bottom-up beta you can use either one and plug in your company's payout ratio to give you a predicted price earnings ratio for your company given how are the U.S stocks are priced you could also take the same stock and run against a global regression will you get the same p e ratio not necessarily you're asking a different question right when you run the U.S regression the question you're asking is given how other U.S stocks are priced what should Coca-Cola with a second regression with the global regression the question I ask is given how stocks globally are being priced how's Coca-Cola pressed and you can already see that you can get two different answers to the question and you can decide to run both and pick the one that remember ultimately at the end you get to decide whether to buy or sell the stock all of this is this ammunition that you use to make that decision so any questions on on on on those regressions because basically I've done those regressions are from January 1st 2023 they're already starting to get dated because the numbers will ship but I'm not re-running the regression just for you in April of 2023. so remember though that might cause some variation in what you get so let's come to a question that each of you will probably have to you know ask an answer Isha asked me this question already but I'm sure others will come to the same point or reach the same point which is you know all these choices in terms of multiples which one should we use let's start with the first one what's in the numerator you can either have Enterprise Value or Equity value right if you're doing a financial service firm a bank an investment Bank an insurance company don't even ask this question the only thing you should be using in the numerator is equity value trying to compute an Enterprise value for a bank is impossible to do so it's Equity back if you're not doing a bank then the real driver or whether you use equity value or Enterprise values are are there big differences in leverage across your sector so we have 15 companies the debt ratios are all 25 you can get away using an equity multiple but if some have five percent some are 50 some have 80 percent then I think you're better off using Enterprise right so everybody comfortable with that choice Enterprise Value or Equity value make the choice based on Leverage if you have a non-financial service company and make it always Equity we're doing a financial service company second choice you're going to run into what goes into my denominator remember the scalars revenues you can have ebitda you can have Abid you can have net income you can have cash flows you can have Book value you could even have number of users number of subscribers so which one should I use here are three questions asked first is how are you measuring value if you're measuring it as Enterprise Value some of these scalars can't be used right you cannot use net income you cannot use Book value Equity if enumerators Enterprise rent so that's going to be part of the fact the second is desperation is going to drive you towards some if you have a company that's losing money it's Book value Equity is negative I mean sooner or later you're going to keep climbing and until you find something positive might be revenues your revenues are non-existent then you have to climb even deeper or dig even deeper and come up with users subscribers downloads and finally and this is just a personal bias I prefer scalars that are less affected by accounting choices I don't like earnings per share why because everything accountants do affects earnings per share so if you have aggressive accounting you can end up in companies looking cheap so that's just my personal bias but you have to factor that in it because remember some of these scalars are more affected by accounting choices than others so you picked the numerator you picked the denominator third choice you have to make do you want to use the most recent year which for most of you should be 2022 by now but for some of you it still might be especially doing a non-us company I know the financials are slow coming in if you use currently as numbers then it might be 2021 numbers it could be trailing 12 months which could be very different from the current numbers it could be a forward number expected values for 20 20 23 which is I think s p Capital like you gives expected earnings expected revenues for the next year I don't know whether s p Capital like you does this but you could use expected revenues five years from now or expect you're saying why would I do that again it's desperation you have companies in your sector they're all young companies so that choice is going to be driven by partly what stage in the life cycle your company is when you have very young companies go with forward numbers because you'll get more substance if you have more mature companies you have more choice you can stay with current numbers or trailing numbers because they already have substance good question second if you have cyclical companies commodity companies you might want to smooth things out rather than divide by last year's earnings you can take an average over the lawsuit you don't have to but something to consider and finally if you can get forecasted values that's on that's the only time where you can do forward numbers so if you want to use over 10 year forward numbers getting that might be difficult for companies in your sector so that might constrain you on how much or forwarding time you go on and finally when you think about what should go in your comparable list start with you know what what what do companies share globally is this the kind of sector like steel or mining where companies globally look very similar or is it sector like Telecom where there might be regulatory differences across regions where you want to stay domestic that's going to determine whether you go with just U.S companies or whether you go with the global sample second if you're worried about the fact that you have a small company in a sector filled with big companies you have a big company sector filled with small companies rather than beat yourself up by asking a little smaller larger companies have higher and lower price earnings ratios or EB debit tests let the data 10 you know what I mean by that you have 20 companies in the market cap of every company you have the EB debitab for every company if there is a link between Market size a market cap and EB debit tax should show up in the data so check the data when you have it done and if you think about how big a sample you need depends on what you plan to do after you've collected the conference remember what you could do you could just do a direct eyeballing comparison in which case you're doing Uber you might have only three companies in my group Uber lived and grabbed there's only three publicly traded or you can say look that's too small because I want to do statistics in which case I need a larger sample so how big a sample you go for will depend on what you plan to do with that sample if you want to run regressions you need to get as close to double digits as you can and even if you get to 10 you're going to be stuck with one independent variable because we want to run these elaborate regressions we have four or five variables you got to have 60 70 80 companies in your samples so I'm not trying to direct you to one choice or the other but I'm saying think through your choices and that'll give you at least a sense of what to do so let me close up pricing with a couple of propositions that I think are pretty easy to understand but I think a common sense might as well state when you price a company and tell me that it's underpriced or overpriced it's always relative to something always specify what you price something against before you tell me something is cheaper expensive so you can say my stock is cheap on a PE ratio basis always complete that sentence by saying relative to other software companies in the US or relative to other small software companies in the US pricing is always a conditional statement intrinsic value is not a conditional statement it's an absolute state second no matter how how much you try once you get that list of comparables together there will be differences between your company and the rest of the conference you can tell me a story if that's what makes your clock tick but if we can control for those differences which is what all those regressions you saw the last session were about even better so complete your pricing tell me what you compare to your company to what's a group against which you made the judgment and second how you control for differences any questions on so let's let's review the four steps I give you a multiple first step is to find the multiple two subtests right make sure it's consistently defined what does that mean if the numerator is an equity value the denominator has to be an equity back if the numerator is an Enterprise Value the denominator must be an Enterprise and an operating value make sure it's uniformly estimated estimated the same way for all 15 20 25 companies in your group second describe sounds fancy but put up at least a histogram of the companies in your sector having a picture in front of you is so much better than actually having a table in front of you look at what's high looked slow look at where you come and leave Falls in that histogram and if you're losing companies in the process of computing a multiple you know what I mean by that if you do PE ratio you lose seven companies out of the 20 you add in your sample keep track of those set there's a bias introduced every time you lose confidence Define describe analytics if you have an equity multiple go back to the simplest Equity valuation model you can think of I can think of the stable growth dividend discount model with a little algebra you can tell me what drives an equity multiple we have an Enterprise Value multiple go back to an Enterprise Value model do the algebra you should be able to tell me what drives an Enterprise valuable Define describe analyze and only that should you apply be religious about this pricing will become much more straightforward you will learn very quickly to respect the data in a sense you're letting once you enter the pricing domain it's not a question of what I would like to see or what you would like to see the results it's whatever the data tells you about what investors are thinking about when they attach a number to a company any questions about any aspect of pricing and it can be from something you're running into in a project if you've started the pricing any questions that would take a little detail here remember the start of the class I said there were three ways you could put a number to a company intrinsic valuation pricing and I talked about option pricing and if you take the option pricing I said it's very rare maybe five out of ten ultimately if you look at the first two those are the two predominant ways in which you can put you can either do an intrinsic valuation or a DCF or you can price a company I always get some pushback on this because I said what about asset based valuation why aren't you counting it as a different approach and in a minute I'm going to talk about why but there are people who who argued that this is a third way to put a values to Value the assets of a company individually it's at the bank so let's set up the process let's think about the places where you're going to run into asset-based valuation the first is we get a job or your job is to estimate the liquidation value of companies companies get liquidated they get sold liquidation valuation you're selling the pieces of the company for scrap you're adding number it's you have to Value each individual asset you have to sell you have no choice you can't value the whole company because you have to sell the pieces the second is accounting valuation this terrifies me but 65 percent of all valuations done on the face of the Earth today are accounting based valuations you will go to work for Ernst and Young Deloitte and you join the valuation practice they're all excited you're going to Value companies for transactions forget about most of your valuations uh what I call for show what why do you why do accountants have to do valuation because of this whole notion of fair value accounting where you're required to take assets on your on your balance sheet and restate them to fairvan I'm going to talk about why what accounts are doing is so dangerous but the reality is a lot of asset face valuation you have to Value each individual item separately and shorten the badge the third scenario we might run into as best valuation is when you want to Value the piece because you want to do something about it you're in a choir planning to take over a company and break it up you want to Value the pieces to see what you can get in a breakup or you could be a long-term investor who wants to Value the parts and if the price is low what are you hoping for over time that the market will learn its mistakes and correct those mistakes one of Warren Buffett's most famous Investments was in American Express in the early 1960s and American Express at that time got most of its value from its credit card at only one card no no no Platinum cards no black cards it was just the traditional American Express card an American Express whatever reason invested in this salad oil company in Italy don't ask me why but it turned out that sale at all it was contaminated it started killing people which is not usually a feature you look for in a salad oil and the whole thing became illegal Nightmare and American Express's stock price dropped and what Warren Buffett did was he took the Green Card the American Express card franchise value the franchise separately valued two other smaller business than American Express was in and he saw that the price was trading at half of just the franchise value of the green card he bought the stock and over time the price adjusted and it became part of that Legend of Warren Buffett of how he bought the stock when it was down on its life so there are investors who can do some of the parts valuation not because they think the adjustment is going to happen overnight or they want to make the adjustment but they think the market will come to its census so let's take these processes and look at why asset-based valuation is not its own game that's the base evaluation what do you do you take each ass that a company owns and you try to estimate a number for that aspect what are the two ways I cannot get a number for an individual asset one is I can do an intrinsic let's not use a counting Language Fair Value as I said you could do an intrinsic valuation of the asset by producing the cash flows and discounting the fact what's the other I can price the ads asset base valuation is not a third approach I can either do intrinsic valuation it's a application of one of those approaches and that's why I don't think of it as a third way of putting a number it's just either intrinsic valuation in pieces or pricing in pieces so with that lead in let's and of course there's the third way in which you can put a number which is your trust the accountant to take the book file you know where you see this you will uh see it in companies where things get marked to Market so holding company where you have 10 publicly traded companies you can take and the other is in real estate there's a notion called net asset value which is actually an accounting book value applied in these companies the difference though is because it's real estate the properties get appraised to what they call fair prices and then the net ask value should reflect it okay so let's think about when it's easiest to do this asset-base valuation when it gets more difficult asset-base valuation is the easiest to do when you have separable assets I'll give you an example you have a real estate company with 10 rental properties that it owns can you value each property separately each property has its rental income its expenses they've separate that in contrast let's suppose you wanted to do a sum of the parts valuation of disk how would that even work because if you take the theme parks and you look at where they get the revenues they get it because the movies did well or you take streaming streaming does well if Star Wars movie comes out the businesses at Disney are not separable because they're all spill into each other much more difficult to do an asset based valuation in Disney then it will be at a real estate company composed of real estate holdings that's acceptable so far it'll be nice if each of these assets has its own Financial State it's here again having a property or 10 properties helps because each property has its own rental income and its expenses it's easy to figure out what goes with each property the case of Disney have asked you what's Disney streaming's income statement look like the only answer you can give me it looks awful but I don't know how awful because they don't break their revenues down by business and their expenses down and their cash flows down by business so separable assets Standalone earnings and cash flows you can value each one individually and finally it's nice if you can find an active market for similar assets let's go back to the real estate example can I price each property separately let's suppose I have a real estate company that owns 10 properties just in New York ranging from a commercial property in downtown you know office building in Downtown New York to a rental building in the Upper East Side so basically I look at other downtown commercial properties I price the building and I take each building and I price it because real estate is the most priced game of them all everywhere based on transactions that add up the numbers negative some of the parts price much easier in some businesses than we watch so I'm at least going to set up the process for thinking about liquidation valuation because really there's not much guidance I can give you on liquidation valuation because liquidation valuation what are you trying to estimate if I shut the business down today and I sell off the pieces what could I get first is this a value Mission or a pricing mission what do you have to do you have to sell it right what do people pay you can show them in your DCF look I've done a DCF you know it's worth at least 15 minutes I don't care I pay you six dollars because that's what other people are paying and actually I'm knocking off pointy five percent why because you're in a hurry to sell this is like you know people who go bargain hunting in on Saturdays in garages these must be desperate people this is their they go around that's a dollar no I'll offer you 50 cents for it I don't know how much gain you get from negotiating on this one but with liquidation I don't think I should have used the word valuation it's liquidation pricing with a discount added on to the pricing because you're not hurry to get rid of everything so liquidation valuation should really be liquidation pricing with the discount attached the more in a hurry you are to liquidate assets what about fair value accounting and if you're planning to become CPAs here you are oh my God you need help but that's okay see somebody's got to do the dirty job right so if but but accounting is increasingly moving towards this philosophy of fair value accounting as opposed to what what's old-fashioned accounting what what showed up in balance sheets whatever you paid adjusted for depreciation amortization was perfect what we've seen in the last 20 or 30 years perhaps with the best of intentions is you want to move away from those old book values because they're dated and they don't reflect reality to something that they call farewell so I remember when this process got started about 20 25 years ago I wrote this you know this diatribe really that you guys shouldn't be doing this you're stepping on my turf and the pushback I thought was we're doing it for good reasons we want investors to know what they're investing so I asked them to send me the original and they said they sent me the original accounting rule that gave birth to fair value accounting and I noticed that they talked a lot about attaching numbers to assets based on what a market participant would pay in an arm's length transaction if you solve the aspect let me repeat that again they wanted you to come up with numbers for individual assets based on what you would get from a market participant in an arm's length transaction let's break this apart first arm's length is good I don't want to get too close to these people okay but the reason they put arms 19 is otherwise you get transactions which are inside a transaction but what are they asking you to estimate is this a pricing machine or a market participant in an Armstrong transaction today that sounds a lot like a pricing mission right the title of my piece is where's the value at fair value accounting because when you read this description you very quickly realize that what they wanted to do is to attach a pricing to each app I have a problem with that but here's what I have a problem with when they wrote this they also required accountants who did this to back up that number with a discounted cash flow valuation you see the problem here this is like asking people to bring a baseball bat to a soccer game that's actually not a bad idea you break the knees of the person trying to defend you you run past them but it's wrong sport right so if you want to do people to do a pricing what should your tool set include multiples and controvers a discounted cash flow valuation is not the tool you need and it creates more frustration than any other aspect of what happened to the valuation business I'll give you an example it's about six years ago an accounting team that had been called in by Fidelity because you know that because of the post-2001 rules for uh you know hedge funds investors is everything has to be marked to Market every period now if you're a Fidelity and you invest in publicly traded companies that happens automatically with publicly traded stocks right everything gets marked to Market because the market price changes but starting about a decade ago Fidelity and other big public Equity investors started investing in startups and private companies and Fidelity actually invested in Uber in 2017. they're like one percent share Uber so this is before Uber goes public an accounting team had landed up in Fidelity there to estimate a number to put on that one person holding what's their mission to come up with a number that reflects what they could sell the one person of uber for so they did what they were required to do run a discounted cash flow valuation this is where I get dragged into the picture they called me their their wits end they said look we've done a discounted cash flow evaluation of uber and we have a problem and I said what's your problem he said we'll come up with only 200 million I said I don't see that as a problem they said we need to come up with at least a billion I said why is it because the Saudi Investment fund investment Uber at a pricing of 65 billion we know what piece of uber we own and we take that 65 billion which becoming up with roughly a billion otherwise the accounting Regulators will not accept the number so we've tried everything we've tried to push the growth rate above the risk-free rate No but so I said yes what you need to do take the reinvestment out make the growth rate go to 10 in perpetuity get to a billion by crook because in a sense this has become a kabuki dance right the problem here is not with what you're doing it's with the mission you've been given and what you've been asked to do to back up the mission it's accounting's problem that becomes the problem for every person in the space so for those of you end up in accounting valuation don't let this frustrate you here's what I would do do a pricing of your company come up with a number then your entire process I know this is not what I'm supposed to do is you know you got the revenue growth the margin the reinvestment you play it with them enough you will end up with a number that matches up what you wanted to see get really good at it and then develop stories that just you can tell really big stories with distractions thrown into the metal throw an AI story in the middle nobody will learn any idea what it does you know so you will learn the tricks but it's not your keep telling yourself it's not your fault it is not your fault it's a counting's problem and until accounting rule writers learn the difference between value and price this problem will not go away so let's talk about some of the parts valuation again remember some of the parts valuation you're doing because you want to act on it so this is not for sure like it was in accounting there there's really real money behind so we've got to take it seriously and there are two groups of people where you're going to see this being used one is investors who follow the Warren Buffett path of saying I want to buy a company for less than the sum of its parts hoping that there's an adjustment in price over time or you have an activist investor or an acquirer says I want to buy this company at a price below the sum of its parts and then after I buy it I'm going to break it up so I'm going to take a company and take it through the sum of the parts process so you can see how this process plays out the company is called United Technologies I used to call it the poor man's GE but now I call it the rich man's Gene because at that time when it because the poor man's EG was this master company United Technologies was was this Warner BGE now GE is a Walking Dead company in the United Technologies is actually a Walking Company not a Walking Dead company so this is a company that fits nicely into the sum of the parts and you're going to see why it's in six different businesses very Divergent businesses first the first business and each business has its own name so it's actually almost a standalone company in terms of so carriers refrigeration system spread Whitney's defense Otis is construction those elevators that you take a check I think we have all this elevators and operating UTC Fire and Security security Hamilton suntran is manufacturing it's Sikorsky are those helicopters that you see landing on top of big buildings six very different businesses and here's what made some of the parts valuation easy to do United Technologies broke down almost everything by business it will almost I think they maintained separate financials for the company they have a Consolidated company but they report so I have revenues capex depreciation everything you'd get in a traditional financial statement I have this in front of me I'm going to do the easier part first first is I can take these six businesses and price them right how would I price up by looking at other companies in each of the business and seeing how they Trade It so I'm going to do a back of the envelope some of the parts price now this is the kind of pricing you would do after a long dinner you've had lots to drink but you would call eye candy he says what do you think Sony's what you pull an envelope up and you turn it right in the front of the envelope I guess as well but it's always called back of the envelope you turn the envelope over and you take each piece and here's what you do you take the air bit dub each of the six business which you will give it you take the average EB debit of read sector how you have that after dinner and three drinks I don't know but maybe you have an s p Capital IQ access there you pull it up you pull up the and then you take each business's ebitdon you multiply it by the EV to Habitat for the sector to come up with an estimated Enterprise right you see why I call it back the envelope you're essentially taking each company each business is ebitda multiplying by the average ebitda for the sector and coming up with an Enterprise value for the company when I do this and this is what analysts mean when they do some when they say some of the parts valuation is this is all they've done what am I assuming about United Technologies businesses and I do this deep that they're very much like the average right anytime you use the average PE the average EB debiter so I'm assuming that the growth and the risk of the cash flows are very similar to the average company myself which might or might not be true is there a way I can finish do a better pricing what do we do with traditional companies to control for the fact that you're higher growth and lower risk and different payout what do we do to bring those into our pricing new Randall's regressions uh P against growth what if I did that and that's basically what I did is I took each of the businesses it's a lot of work because you now have to do six pricings to uh to get a pricing for a single company so I took publicly traded companies in refrigeration systems in defense and I read regressions on three different EV multiples for each of them so the six times three eighteen regressions are an EB to sales you're saying why do you stick with Enterprise Value multiples rather than price earnings remember these are divisions I don't know how much debt is in each division so I wanted to stay with Enterprise Value I ran three regressions on each one and guess which one I'm reporting here as the multiple as a regression I picked the highest r squared regression saying in this sector indicate the case of refrigeration systems EB to Epitaph worked the best in defense EB to revenues work the best so with each one I'm getting the advantage of picking the best regression in terms of predictive value and you know what I'm going to do next right I took United Technologies numbers for each business plug them into the regression and got predicted and so think of this as a more sophisticated pricing your pricing each business based not just in the average but on the fact that you have higher growth the lower risk in each business I don't think I mentioned I got 66 billion at the back of the the envelope pricing when I adjust for the differences I come up at 74.2 billion I'm still pricing the company but at least it's a better pricing so if I wanted to price a company do a sum of the Parts pricing and some of you might decide to do this for your company if you have two businesses let's say you have Uber and you have you know ride sharing and you're delivering and you can come up with some way of estimating different multiples for each one you can estimate the Enterprise value for each one and add them up and and come up with the pricing for the company but it's still uprising can I do an intrinsic valuation of these six businesses or let me ask you the question differently what would I need to do to do an intrinsic valuation some of the parts here how to take each business and estimate cash flows and growth and risk and I have the ammunition to do it it's a pain in the neck to do but I can do it so let me start by estimating the cost to capital for each of these six businesses so rather than Computing one cost of capital for the entire company I'm Computing a cost cap for each business what do I need for that I need a beta but thank God the way we estimate paid is we're already ready to go right we've got non-level beta for each business we get 11 beta and incidentally I gave each business the same deterioration of the cost of debt I don't have to but in this case I did I end up the cost of capital and you can notice that if I just picked based on cost of capital which is the best business that they're in lowest cost of capitalism yeah that looks like fire insecurity but don't be so quick right that's just the cost of capital the lowest cost of capital when you have a cost of capital what's the other metric We compare cost to Capital to decide whether a business is a good or bad business return on Capital so I computed the return and capital on these six business and again I have the ammunition here because I have all the numbers I need operating income Book value debt Book value of equity cash so through the return cap remember the power and security business look good it's return and capital is actually a little lower than my cost of capital I now have a return in capital for each of the six businesses in addition to a cost of capital I computed read so in other words I did for each business what I would do for an entire company return on Capital cost of capital reinvestment rate growth rate so my final intrinsic part valuation I actually allowed for the fact that five of these businesses had some growth left in them not a huge amount of growth they're all pretty mature but it's a and one of the business was pretty close to mature already that's the other Advantage you get when you value each business separately if I use Coca-Cola as my example for Asia I might have a 10-year growth period because there might be growth left but for the US I might have stable growth this is about as good as it gets and for Europe I would put a negative growth because of rules coming from the EU on health I might say look I'm looking forward I'll get minus five percent growth I get the luxury of having different growth periods and different growth rates and I build them so I have very different companies and comes to return on Capital cost of capital growth rates growth periods but here's the bottom line with those inputs put in I get an intrinsic value for each of the of the five businesses I'm sorry six businesses and you add them up the value that I get for the six businesses put together is 80.25 so let's see with the back of the envelope pricing I got 66 billion with this more sophisticated pricing adjustment difference I got 74 billion with an intrinsic valuation I'm getting close to 80.25 billion but there's one final loose end that I have to tie up this is looking at each business's ebitdirect United Technologies as a headquarters building as is often the case when you have these big multi-business companies where they've centralized some functions like accounting right each so rather than have each business do its own accounting they're all centralized you're saying so what those costs are not in my habitat in the case of United Technologies those costs amounted to 408 million dollars in the year that I did this valuation when I when I see people doing some of the parts valuation they ignore the 408 million completely which is a very you can take a very cynical view which is nothing that happens at headquarters ever mattered so I'm going to act like my Wipeout headquarters nothing will change in my phone but that's not true right if you've Consolidated accounting in your headquarters building and you make these six businesses independent businesses some of those expenses go to those businesses in other words if I left the valuation at 80.2 billion I'm going to overvalue United Technologies so I want to bring in that corporate cost here's the simplest way to do it I took the 408 million the most recent year assumed it would continue in perpetuate so it's a cost it's a cash outflow I will get a tax savings from it because it's tax deductible the present value of those corporate expenses after taxes in Perfection is 4.6 billion what does that mean out of the 80.25 billion I'm subtracting out the 4.6 billion to end up with an intrinsic value based on some of the parts valuation of 75.7 billion so let me review where what I have I have 66 billion with the kind of back of the envelope pricing 74 billion with more sophisticated pricing about 75 billion with an intrinsic valuation I actually did a full-fledged company valuation where I consolidate everything to do what you know you did on the whole company brought the whole company together I got about 71 value but all of these get compared to what the actual market price which was about 52 billion this is a company that looks like it's being priced well below the sum of its parts no matter how you define it but you do it as a valuation or a pricing so this is what you're looking for if you're actually looking for a company trading at the list of summons Parts if you want to do an entrance evaluation it takes work right but we have only two or three business it's not that much more you just have to take each business separately valued add them all up any questions on entrance graduation I'm sorry about the colors I should have picked them differently but this was about five years ago so GE by this time had fallen from its Glory Days the company that Jack Welch built became this legendary company for a while GE was the largest market cap company in the US for almost a decade by the time I did this valuation it was a Walking Dead company it was an only eight business you see what do you mean only eight businesses g at the height of its Glory was in 26 different businesses can you imagine what that some of the parts valuation would have looked like so I took the eight businesses and I separated them into three groups and the colors even though they're ugly reflect what I thought about these companies Aviation Healthcare and transportation are the businesses with the return in capital that GE made was well above the cost of capital so think of them as their good businesses there are still three good businesses left in GE the the yellow power renewable energy in oil and gas a business where they earned roughly or close to their cost of capital and I'm cutting them a lot of slack in terms of how much below the two red businesses lighting and GE Capital are offer businesses g capital is really the chain that's dragging the company down it's not just a bad business it's a bad big business it's entangled in every other business you know what I mean by entangled g capital actually finances the sales GE Aviation so when G Aviation sells aircraft engines to Boeing g capital is a financing option so it's not like you can separate the company I did do an intrinsic valuation of G as a sum of its parts and now basically I did what I did with United Technologies I did and here's the value that I got for each at First Sight g capital with a negative growth rate I came up with the value of 27 billion but that's the Enterprise value for g capital you subtract out the debt which is 51 billion for GE Capital g capital alone has a minus 24 billion dollar value the first reaction is why don't you just shut the damn thing down if they could they would the only problem is you entangled it and everything else you can't shut it down and this is the problem that she has faced over the last seven years is with GE Capital in the middle it's very difficult for GE to split up into parts and actually take those three good companies they're being dragged down by the bad companies there's nothing I'd be really pissed off when I worked in GE Aviation because you're being dragged down because you have a company which is kind of bound at the hip and no way to easily separate they're trying they're getting closer now to at least breaking up some of the parts but you can see why some company and this is I think this should really be the PostScript the Jack watch that's Legend right he became a legendary CEO because he built up GE as a company and he was the one who made GE capitals such a part of every part of the company and now of course there having to deal with that effect so in many ways the monster he created is now the monster bringing them down so any questions about some of the parts valuations some of your companies you might be able to try it at least in a very very rough basis at least on the pricing side so give it a shot it's actually an interesting way to think about why am I paying no this much for a company I know right now you know you you put you but Scott Galloway right Scott and I go back and forth because God of course has got you know he doesn't like big tech companies he wants to break them but I want you to start thinking about if you are valuing Facebook in parts you know what the parts would be right you'd have Facebook Instagram WhatsApp would you even be able to separate them into pots what about Amazon can you take Amazon cloud services AWS separately from Amazon Prime and Amazon you're already going to see that with these big tech companies it's very difficult to get the separation you want to actually be able to Value them in Parts because the ecosystem is connecting all of them and it's not easy to separate that ecosystem into into its individual parts talk about value private businesses you know what I mean for private business it is a privately owned businesses and I'm going to start by stating something that shouldn't have to be said but I want to put on the table you know what drives the value of Private Business cash flows growth and risk that sounds familiar it's what drove the value of a public company that said there are two things you're going to run into with private companies that are going to make you uncomfortable the first is there is no market value out there you're saying who cares I don't care you're going to see in a moment why taking the market value away from you is going to leave you feeling lost the second and this is something again that you run into with public companies more so with private companies if you are concerned about how confusing and Divergent accounting was across public companies you should see how Divergent the accounting can become with small private businesses so let's start with the first question you say who cares that there's no market value of equity first in your evaluation of your public company did the market value Equity actually become an input into your discounted cash flow validation or let me rephrase the question where did it become an input one is in the cost of capital right what are the weights you need you need market value rates for debt and Equity so already you can say well how the heck do I compute a cost to capital for a private company if I don't have market cap we'll talk about that but clearly that's a problem you know where else it becomes an input when you give me the options outstanding in your company I have to Value those options you need the price per share to Value the options so already you can see you're a little lost without those numbers let's follow through you finish evaluation what is the first number you checked after you got the value for your company the market price right let's say your value is three dollars per share the market price is three thousand dollars per share what's your first reaction I screwed up I got it three units there maybe I entered things in thousands and millions good right you know that you've screwed up it's right there in front of you when you value a private company you come up with the value of three dollars especially there's nothing to compare you could be off by a thousand factor of thousands you have no idea it's nice to have something to compare I know for some of you it became more than something impaired again something to hold on to and you got closer and closer and closer then you were right there you know that's okay no but but but having a market price does make your life easier and finally there are some risk measures that are based on market price like what if you get paid is the traditional way you run a regression right of what returns in the stock against return to the market at index and to run that regression you need stock prices there's some people look at private companies say how do you value them I can't get a I went on Bloomberg I looked at my for my company over and over and I could not find it of course you couldn't find it it's a privately owned business you try cargo for instance one of the largest private companies in the world there are a lot of Stories on Bloomberg you can get on cargo but you will not be able to get a paid so not having a market price is going to be a problem it's not an insurmountable problem but we have to figure out ways to get along let's talk about what problems you might run into an estimating cash flows the definition for free cash flow of the firm is exactly the same for a private as opposed to public content right you need earnings you need net capex you need change from working capital you need tax rates saying what can be different first the financial history often look at private companies tends to be much more short-term and much more in terms of how well it's kept up much more difficult to use over that second you know talked about different Accounting Standards some of you all already complained about your value in Indonesian company you're pissed off because Indonesian Accounting Standards don't seem to follow U.S Accounting Standards stop complaining talk to that person in my class 10 years ago decide to Value her mother's flower shop she said I want to Value something close to me I said okay be my guest four weeks later she comes back into my office I want to change my company I said what happened do you have a fight with your mother she said no I went and asked my mother for financials and she took me into a small storage room in the back where every wall was covered with Post-it notes she said that's my Revenue wall and she had all these pink posted notes see different colors at least there's a there was a cost war and that's how she did her accounting but she had a flower shop run who has the time to do accounts every time she sold something she wrote in a Post-It note put it on the wall time she had a call she put it on the other wall at least she got the walls right at the end of the year she pulled all the Post-it notes down probably I don't even want to visualize that day see what happens in the Post-it notes fall off on the ground I have no idea sir let's not even think about that and I took it to her accountant I don't think posted note accounting is part of IFRS a gap but when you have a small business it can happen third with private businesses the line between the personal and the business can become a very gray one there's a company car a van but every afternoon at about 3 15 it seems to disappear for an hour strangely at the time that kids schools let out right I mean can you blame the owner of a singer take the man pick up the kids drop them off at home bring them back I won't tell the IRS you don't tell the IRS we're all okay and there are employees that are private business has he said what does that guy do he seems to be doing nothing I don't know yes the same last name is the owner I call this the George Costanza effect seen Seinfeld in all my years of watching Seinfeld I could never figured I'd figure out what George did for the Yankees what is his official title assistant to the equipment manager or something I think there was one episode where he replaced the uniforms with polyester it did not end well but the rest you see him talking to the back of George steinbrenner's head and I have no idea what he's talking about there are a lot of George costanzas wandering around in privaters what is and finally there's there's a very important issue to remember the private businesses many owners of Private Business to spend all of their time running the business right but they don't charge themselves on salary why because they're going to get whatever's left over anyway you think so what even if they do their financials right you see why this is going to create a problem they give you the income statement for the business but remember they didn't charge them for the salary let's say you're naive enough to pay for that business based on what the income statement said it's a lot of money I'll pay them based on the day after you walk into the business yes well who's in charge of the accounting here that was the owner a little lady said who keeps the inventory of that was the owner too you notice the floors are related who vacuums reports the owner does it after the store you see where this is going to lead you right it somebody's got to do this work you haven't built into the cost you either have to spend 20 hours a day and cost your time out or you have to hire other people to do it it means the income for private business is often overstated because you have infected that salary none of these are insurmountable problems with their problems anyway one final point about private companies with a public company that's the question why do you want me to Value the public company the answer saying doggies you value the public companies the market price you buy it cheaply set of its expense with a private company motive matters I Remember by 25 years ago yeah this lady wanders into my office I think she I thought she was in the wrong car but she wanted it as if the office was hers and she said no would you be you know could you value my business money I said not really but she said I really this is you're on the candy company and I said why do you want your business value so what do you mean why do you why do I want my personal distracted I said do you want it valued because you're curious you've built this business do you want to Value this business because you're getting divorced and your spouse is going to get half the value because I know what you'd like to see as a value there do you want to value a business because the tax guy is after you or do you want to Value this business for sale she said would it matter I said I'm going to give you four very different numbers depending on what reason you have she said oh I guess I'm planning to sell the business I said to whom she said you have a lot of questions why did I need to know she said what do you mean to whom I said are you going to sell it to a publicly traded company maybe her she's an interest in buying a candy company maybe it's a private Equity investor is buying your company maybe it's another individual you're setting would the number be different I said yes and already you can see layers to private company valuation because the same business can have a different value depending on who's buying the company so one of the things that we're going to talk about is how valuation challenges get more difficult depending on the setting you have for the valuation so you think about why we value Private Business it can be for as a Prelude to a spin-off sometimes to them and so even in public companies you might be valuing divisions almost like private companies where you have to do the same kinds of issues so let's talk about four sets of private business transactions and you're going to see how the challenges vary depending on the job I'm going to start with what I think is the most difficult setup when you have a private to private transaction order of a private business is selling to another individual I'll give you my favorite examples you have a doctor you know in the old days doctors used to own their practices rather than have some company on their practices so you got to be 65 70 sold your practice to a younger dog one doctor selling to another doctor one dentist selling now the dentist one plumber selling to another Plum private and private transactions I'm going to argue those are the most difficult of all valuations you know and I'm going to I'm going to list some of the challenges second I'm going to talk about private to public transactions that's if you have a private business you're selling to a public company things get a lot easier and you're going to see in a moment why so you're selling to a public company third is a private company that's planning to go into an IPO go public so we're going to talk about the special issues that come up when your pricing a valuing company for an IPO and I'm going to close off with this multi-stage problem we have a young startup with a lot of promise you're going to venture cap so you're valuing the company because you want them to invest in it but ultimately you plan to exit with an IPO how this process plays out in evaluation so let's start with private to private transactions and list out the challenges you will face in a private to private transaction first in a private to private transaction it is very unlikely that the buyer or the seller of the business or the buyer is going to be Diversified you see why if you have a doctor you've spent your entire lifetime building up a practice my guess is most of your wealth is tied up in that practice a young daughter doctor buying your business probably going to take every dollar he or she has saved to buy a business you say who cares up till this point when we computed cost of equity what do we use as a measure of risk we use debate and when you use beta what do you implicitly assuming then investors Diversified already you can see the challenge the entire structure for using betas is going to come apart because the buyer is not advisable we'll talk about how to get over it but that's going to be an issue second that investment you're making in that private business is a liquid I know people like to use the word liquidity discounts I like to I prefer the term cost of buyers remorse have you ever had buyers remorse this is how it will play out when does Jim Cramer come on CNBC I try not to watch the guy but he comes on sometime during during the day right so let's say you make the mistake of turning your TV on at the wrong time and Jim is on and he says buy something and in a moment of weakness you actually buy and then you bang your head and say what the heck did I do this guy screams out like 50 companies every 15 minutes I bought one of the companies what's the cost of buyers remorse there you sell immediately if you have a discount brokerage house you pay six dollars each way that's twelve dollars but you also have a bid ask spread right even if nothing's happened the price there's going to be and if it's a liquid stock he's saying who cares the cost of buyers remorse if you bought and sold apple is probably one tenth the 100 you know 100th of a percent but if you aren't none of you wealthy enough to do this yet but let's say you get to be 35 40 at a long day at work you're on your way home you stop at the corner grocery store you're tired you buy the grocery store with your family savings then you get home and you tell your spouse what you did I was tired and I bought a grocery store with our entire savings and here she says what the heck were you thinking go sell it you see how much more difficult this is to reverse you're going to stand outside person you want to buy a grocery store I need to get rid of it quickly that's the cost of buyers remorse With Private Business you buy the business getting out is so much more difficult so you know what you tend to do is when you value a private business you build in that cost of buyer's remorse it's called in a liquidity into the process and finally with private to private transactions you have what I call a key person effect on value again I'll use a personal example to bring this on I've had four kids they've all needed braces this is an extraordinarily involved process I wouldn't even go to a dentist I was 32. so luckily I was genetically okay with my teeth I guess otherwise all my teeth would be out right now but my kids every it's not a one-time deal and I thought braces you're done but every month you have to go tighten it you have to attach these stick so there are these dentists and you know that basically this is the living there they deal with young kids and braces and our dentists call this guy his name is Howie and you know so I take all four kids in it'll take like an hour to do and he used this opportunity ask me questions about markets and investing and valuation so so we're stuck and he's asking me questions and he pops up he says you know what I'm thinking of retired and I said oh you're 40 years old why are you retiring he said I'm pretty rich and I said I know my credit card already shows that and he said I'm trying to sell the business but I'm running into a problem I show potential buyers the value of the business so the income I made last year and I made a lot of income it's like rubbing it you know exactly where that income is coming from yeah but they're not paying that income and you can see why right if you're a dentist and you buy Howie's business based on the income and next day you install yourself as a dentist and I walk in with my four kids and you say I'm your dentist you know what I'm going to say no you're not you don't look like Howie my kids are not going to sit in a chair for you I'm leaving you know what that's going to mean right so when I look at the actual income I earn as the dentist owning this practice it's going to be significantly lower than what I thought I was going to do who are attaching a 30 40 50 discount he said what should I do so I get I told him what he needed done you could probably tell him as well what should he do to minimize this key person with response in fact many dentists and doctors do this get more dentists I mean it's not going to solve the problem he still wants to go off to I don't know where he would retire to be Cayman Islands I guess what's making it difficult is the next day when I show up there's this new dentist I've never seen right they said how he have some bad news for you the chick path I'm going to give you is going to give you a higher value but you got to hang around for a couple of years sell the business but get a nice big easy check you have a lot of money anyway and get sit there put up a TV watch Netflix all day and whenever a new patient comes in take the patient over to the new dentist introduce them and make them be friends kind of hang out there in the outskirts and then in fact many key person discounts that's how you reduce that discount is by creating that that that something you never think about public companies right private businesses there's a lot more of this buried transaction specific assessment that's often subjective that you have to do and that's good news AI can replace a public company evaluation it's plugging enough AI is much more difficult to replace in private company appraisal because you've got to talk to people you've got to understand the transaction so think of that as good news while you're struggling with private company valuation this is why people will still need you even if AI takes over everywhere everywhere else so next session will restart a startup we're going to spend time valueing a restaurant that you're going to buy as an investment bank so you know we talk about how that works out but reduce all of these 
okay we're very busy thank you community breakfast thank you you would read the slide okay so where were you I missed you the last two plus yeah but he caught up with the glasses right I'm trying to be explained to me designs I don't think you need a reminder that your next Quiz is a week from today but I'm going to give it to you anyway so it is a week from today for 30 minutes of class I will send you the seating assignments by next Monday or so you'll have you know so again it'll be three I think we'll be back to three rooms again because I you know the two UC rooms in this one and I'll try my best that's all I can do to make sure that you rotate fairly I think two-thirds of the class have already been out of this room there's another one third day we'll get first tips on it the final have no idea how I'm going to do I have to toss a coin I really have no idea um the material for the third quiz will cover everything in packet two which we will finish today so we'll be done with packet two which means next Monday please make sure you download the third and last packet it's a much Slimmer packet last packet of the class So today we're going to complete our discussion of private company valuation and I started this discussion already with one of the bigger challenges when you value private companies you remember I said when you value public companies you make an assumption and the assumption is the marginal investor is well Diversified what does that do when you make that assumption it allows you to focus only on the risk that you cannot diversify away an estimated with the beta the minute you use a beta whether you like it or not you're making the reception and I said in a private company that might not be true because the buyer might not be diverse so in fact might be completely undiversified so with today we're going to go through the mechanics of what to do but I want you to give me the intuition as to what is going to happen to your cost of equity and cost to Capital when a buyer is not Diversified so in a buyers to person focus on beta we come up with a cost of equity in a cost to Capital right let's say you take the same business but now you're looking at a buyer's completely undiversified they're going to put all of their money in that company will they see more risk in the company or less risk more why because they're looking at all of the risk risk that you can eliminate about so you've already kind of answered the question so what's going to happen to the cost of equity then it's going to go up the cost of capital is also going to go up today we're going to go through the mechanism of how to do that but to show you why not all private business buyers are made equal or owners are made equal in on May 9th I have an engagement you can call it that to go talk to the Mets management it's actually a bundled engagement in the morning I'm talking to the 0.72 analysts the afternoon I'm talking to the meds management you know what binds them together right the owner is Steve Cohn on both so somebody who's in Steve Cohen's office asked you know can you come to talk to the point because I've done that before and I said sure So I'm going to go talk to them about narrative and numbers because these are young analysts they've come through they've made the they made it in a sense to under the peak hedge fund like places and our so I said sure and then later I got a call saying oh by the way would you be willing to come to talk to the Mets management and I said I would but it has to be understated it's a day before final start so I said I've got to be in the same place so 0.72 is in Hudson yards and they said we'll get the match management down so yesterday afternoon I was putting together my Corporate Finance presentation for the match it's fascinating to think about how decisions get made at professional sports team and one of the issues that I ran into one of the things I was trying to estimate was a cost of equity for the Mets plus what currency should I do it and let this easy one US dollar say why go looking for trouble right I could do a Japanese Yen or a Euro but you know what Equity risk cream should I use same equities elsewhere the price of risk of the price of risk which leads me to the question of Bayless right how many publicly traded sports franchises are there in the US one actually just one it's Madison Square Gardens the closest thing you can get and even that is not a pure franchise it owns the next but it also is all of the other stuff that happens the Green Bay Packers are technically owned by the people of Green Bay but there isn't a single publicly traded sports franchise in the US there are publicly traded sports franchises in Europe mostly soccer Clips so one alternative is to go with soccer team betas so that beta was like 1.16 the other of course is to focus on entertainment companies after all once you get to professional sports yesterday I went to a Yankee game cost me a hundred dollars two people but even with the price you know I got a decent price this is like going not just to a movie but to a concert so I said it's like entertainment the average pay for entertainment companies is 1.10 but no matter which beta I use I'm focusing only on the risk that cannot be Diversified away right but is Steve Cohen an undiversified owner is the only thing Steve gone owns the Mets no it's one of you know he's all I think worth 15 billion maybe 18 billion three billion dollars or four billion dollars whatever he paid for the Mets might sound like a lot of money 99.99 though well but to him it's one of a bigger portfolio so I'm going to argue for the use of that public company beta there and I'm going to bring up the Yankees all of the time during this session simply to bug the people in that room but this is the one place where bringing up the Yankees it's going to make them feel better with the mats you can use the market beta because the owner is in a sense Diversified right who owns the Yankees come on guys you live in New York even if you've never gone to a baseball game you should know the answer the Steinbrenner family how much of the standard in a family is tied up in the Yankees you think almost all of it it's a seven billion dollar franchise they're not rich outside of this they might have a hundred million or 100 million there the steinbetter families almost completely undiversified so you know what that means right if you think purely financial terms the match should have a lower cost of equity than the Yankees right now I don't know how this will play out but file that away for future reference it's not that it's a private business but the buyer of the business is not Diversified that's causing you to adjust that cost of equation so we talk about the process of adjusting the other big thing we have to deal with is this issue of in liquidity cost of buyers remotes in the example I gave right you bought something you changed your mind and you sell it back right away the cost of bias remorse is what it costs you to make that round trip with a publicly traded stock it might be small especially if it's a large widely followed stock heavily traded but to the private business it can be immense so what do people do they discount the value that they pay for these companies up front for an expected a liquidity event so today I want to talk about how appraisers deal with that in liquidity and private company valuation why I think it's wrong and here's what the appraisers do to deal with the liquidity so there are far more private business appraisers than publicly traded company analysts in the in this country there are thousands and thousands of appraisers and the way the value private companies they do a version of a discounted cash flow model I'll talk about how they adjust for lack of diversification but after they do the valuation they will reduce that they'll take 25 off the top it's called in a liquidity discount and they do it for every company they value small large money making money losing and I think that doesn't make sense and to see why I'm going to give you four companies or four transactions and I wanted to rank these companies in terms of transactions where it has the biggest liquidity discount and transactions will attach the smallest discount so here's the first one it's a profitable cash flow generating company to a long-term buyer a profitable cash flow generating company to a cash constrained buyer so two different buyers or you can have an unprofitable negative cash flow company to a long-term buyer or cash constraint buyer so let's focus on on first the money making versus the money losing cash which should have the larger liquid discount the cash flow generating company or the negative cash flow company the negative cash flow company why what's the essence of liquidity you want cash right if you have a company that's already throwing off cash it's profitable you're actually getting liquidity from the company running if you have a money making cash rich company it's throwing off cash flows you feel less of a need to have to sell the company to get cash I'm not saying the need goes away but it's less so I'd expect the discount to be larger for unprofitable cash negative companies should the discount be greater for a long-term buyer or somebody who's cash constraint yes people why because you need the cash flow much sooner right you worry about liquidity you're gonna you see already I'm setting up a nightmare scenario for you because if I'm a private company owner and I come to you and say Can you estimate what my liquidity discount should be you can't answer the question until you deal with two things one is what kind of company am I am a money making or money losing do I have cash flows that are positive or negative and the other is you can't tell me what the discount is unless you know who the potential buyer is already that's going to create a layer of uncertainty about the discounted plan let's build on this liquidated discount so it's going to be very different across different companies depends on the buyer let's say you estimate these discounts at different points in time first time you estimate it is in 2008 Market is in turmoil you're in the middle of a crisis second time you estimate is five years later Market is doing well the economy is doing well do you think the discount is going to vary across time and if so when is it going to be higher when the market is in a crisis on its boy yep and tell me why everybody wants cash right everybody wants liquidity essentially liquidity discounts are not really going to be different depending on the company and the buyers they're going to be different across time so we'll at least set up the framework for thinking about a liquidity today one final point given what I've said so far about potential buyers and diversification let's say the owner of a private business you're thinking about selling your business and you want the best possible buyer Best in what sense you want to get the highest price and I give you three different choices another private individuals willing to buy a business the second is a private Equity Fund and the third is a publicly traded company which one do you think is likely to offer you the highest price a private buyer a private Equity Fund or a publicly traded company you sure you want to try that your one in three chance this time usually I give you 50 50 shots if you can pass if you want okay okay go ahead and tell me what it is that makes it say business right so what is it that makes your business more valuable to publicly traded company well that's kind of a that's deceptive reason right what's the first thing I started with we talked about discount rates what do we say the when you look at risk what does the risk you look at the risk you if you're a publicly traded company remember your investors are Diversified all you care about is Market risk you can focus on a traditional Market beta come up with the cost of equity a private buyer is usually much more likely to be on Diversified so holding all is constant I would expect the public company to offer the highest price the private buyer to offer the lowest price and the private Equity Fund to fall somewhere in the middle today we're going to quantify that impact and let it lay out deeper questions because it because private Equity Funds are there to try to make money right how do they make money they Arbitrage the difference we do not the private company thinks it's worth to a private buyer and what the private companies were to that's how private Equity Funds make their money they buy it somewhere in the middle and they either take the company public or they sell it to a public company that's their exit so let's go back to where we were in the notes and kind of fill in the details I think we were on page 134 let me take you back to page 134. so let's I'm going to set up the example so let's say you guys are graduated you're working at investment Banks sorry but I blow my nose but you're getting tired of the grind so you're planning to quit and here's what you're going to do you're going to take all of your wealth and this is critical to the story and you're going to buy this upscale French restaurant why because you've been watching Kitchen Confidential on in the Food Network and you say this sounds like so much more fun than working on spreadsheets I'm the owner of the restaurant I'm also the chef the restaurant is a world regarded in the most recent year and I show you the income statement they made four hundred thousand dollars in pre-tax operating profit on 1.2 million dollars in traffic so I'm going to give you three years of financials the company has no debt outstanding but it does have a least commitment of 120 000 each year for the next 12 years the restaurant sits on beliefs so what we're going to do is value the restaurant for you the investment bank and remember all your wealth is going into this restaurant and I'm going to start by showing you the financials for the restaurant last three years of numbers big jumps 800 1.1 million 1.2 million but there's a catcher the restaurant has been growing but it's now at full capacity what does that mean every table is taken for every meal so you can't be growing anymore unless you you know unless you decide to build a second restaurant there is operating least expense I'm doing what accountants used to do pre-2019 treated as an operating experience I wages material other operating expenses but uh one thing I want to mention about the wages is remember I'm the ownership I don't pay myself a Saturday why not because all what's left is going to come to me anyway what's the problem of you valuing this restaurant based on this all even if you there are no no I'm not putting any Shenanigans here the numbers are what they are if you buy this restaurant based on what you see on this income statement say look that seems like a lot of money what's the problem you're going to run the day after you buy the restaurant you should well give me the so the next day you're going to walk into the restaurant it's now your restaurant right but you notice there's nobody in the kitchen so why isn't anybody cooking you know what happened right I was a chef I started the restaurant so what do you have to do you have to bring your cooking skills to play and be Chef you know how quickly the capacity is going to go from 100 to zero percent right because all you can make is peanut butter sandwiches and I think that's the only thing on the menu you're not going to last as a restaurant so you know what you have to do to actually make this restaurant well you'd have to hire a chef and it's going to cost you and it will build in that cost into your income statement so already you can see the work coming into play to Value this restaurant you need to bring in all the pieces you will need to run the restaurant so let's go through the process of adding the restaurant starting with a discount rate what do we need for a discount rate I need a beta and a it's a risk-free rate and a screen going to come back for sure oh thank you so let's talk about it is it it should be on right now suggestion let's talk about estimating this confidence I need a beta right so I go to a Bloomberg terminal enter the name of this restaurant and type in beta what am I going to get nothing can't find the company valuation ends right there saying I can't find a beta but we don't give up that easily right because if you can't find a regression beta you can still get a beta for your company by looking at publicly traded companies in the same space so initially that's what I did I went and looked up publicly traded restaurants and I came up with the beta but it wasn't the kind of beta that you're going to you're going to be happy with so here I'm going to start exactly the same way that I start with public companies but I still have to deal with that problem of lack of diversification but the beta that I got by looking at restaurant companies reflected a mix of restaurants that were not similar to the restaurant I was planning to buy this is an upscale French restaurant what I see on my restaurant list are Burger King and chipotle and I mean I mean their their restaurant chains but they're not the kinds of restaurants so I decided when I value this restaurant to actually use the beta for specialty retailers now luxury retailers arguing that the people who come to my restaurant are the kind of people who shop at those retail stores be creative when you think about betas I know our tendency is to look at other companies in the same sector and stay focused sometimes you might want to shift that Focus because you want to get look at other companies that do well when you do well and do badly when you do badly here I'm going with a group of companies that I think is closer to my business in terms of up and down movements than looking at just restaurants so I got none Levitt beta so that part of the process was pretty similar to what I do with public companies I'm just looking at other publicly traded companies in this space coming up with debate we'll have to deal with the lack of diversification but have an unleaven pain now what's the second step I have to bring in the fact that that captures only the market risk in the company and what did I say about this and about you as an investment banker you took your entire wealth and you put into this restaurant you're the exact opposite of Diversified right you're over concentrate so what risk are you going to see let me set it up in a very simple way if you look at the total risk in a company there's units of Market risk and units of firm specific risk if investors are Diversified all they care about is the market risk it's captured with the beta if you're not Diversified what do you see you see all of that risk and you need to bring all of that risk into your cost of equity you know might say how do I know what all of that rest of the risk looks like is a very simple number and it is a number that you get anytime you run a regression that I think you can use to adjust your beta so here's what I did I went into my bottom-up data page remember I got the publicly traded companies and paid us and if you remember when you when you look at a regression page for your company in addition to a beta for your company you have an r squared for your company right what does the R square tell me that market regression how much let's be specific how much of what which in this case is the company so basically how much of the volatility in the companies explained by the market right so R square tells me that what does 1 minus the r squared then done how much of the risk in that company is not explained by the market in other words every regression you run tells you how much of the risk in your company comes in the market and how much is company specific we don't use it usually because we're publicly traded companies we ignore that here I'm going to bring it into play in addition to looking at the betas I also looked at the average r squared across these high-end retailers the average r squared was 25 percent there's little statistical tangent R squares measure the proportions of variance in your stock that is explained by the market beta is a standard deviation measure some you have no idea what I'm talking about right so anybody remember the full equation for a beta you might have seen it in one of your foundations class what's in beta is equal to rho JM correlation between the stock and the market times the standard you know you look mystified you've never seen this actually that's that's that's how the regression the slope is computed it's rho JM times Sigma J standard deviation stock divided by Sigma of the market standard deviation amount even if that went completely overhead it's a standard deviation measure so I'm going to take the r squared which is a variance measure and take the square root of the R square I want to insult you by asking you what the square root of the r squared is it's obviously going to be the correlation coefficient which is the r so here what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the correlation coefficient which is 0.5 and I'm going to play a little algebra again the 1.18 that I computed was a market bait it captured the market risk in the company and if I were Diversified I'd stop there but you're not Diversified in addition to bringing that risk and you want to bring the rest of the risk in the company into your beta so dividing the beta by the correlation gives me what's called a total beta the reason I call it total beta is I'm capturing the total risk of the company rather than just the market risk it's going to give me a beta of 2.36 twice as high as the market beta and the only reason I'm doing this is because the buyer is not Diversified so work it through 2.36 beta is going to give me a much higher cost of equity the much higher cost of equity is going to give me a much higher cost of capital and it's coming from the fact that the buyer is not divided by but this is still a non-level beta right so it's a in publicly traded companies after you came up with an unleavid of your company what did you have to do to come up with the beta to use for your stock you have to level the beta and to deliver the beta you needed debt to equity ratio and that debt to equity was it a book Debt or Market debt to equity ratio after two quizzes I hope you get the right answer it always is Market debt to equity and with the private company we have a problem you see what the promise there is no Market Equity debt I could dance around perhaps use book Debt but there is no Market equity you can't use book Equity it's completely irrelevant so you're saying what do I do now there are two choices the first choice is an easy one but you might not like it you can assume that if I can you can get the debt to equity ratio of a publicly traded companies in the space which is 14.33 percent you can assume that private companies also operate with roughly the same debt to equity you're making the assumption that there's something about this business that leads companies to pick the debt to equity ratio data you put the 14.33 and you come up with a levit of 2.56 and a cost of equity of 14.5 percent but that's assuming that private businesses borrow roughly the same as public companies in that space what if you don't want to do that is there another way I can come up with the debt to equity ratio for a private company but I don't assume that it moves to the industrial average what do I not have a market value of equity right why am I doing the value at the end of the evaluation where do I arrive at for your company an estimated value of equity for your company could I use your estimated value of equity as the equity in your debt to equity ratio I don't see why not but there's one small problem right you see what the problem is I'm going to have circular reasoning because I need the equity to get the debt to equity I need the debt to equity to get the equity have you ever checked the iteration box in Excel you had to for my fcff kids if you do that you can actually make the debt to equity ratio for a private company a function of your own estimated value of equity so I'm not doing it here but if you want to do it in the spreadsheet you can but just make sure the iteration box is checked otherwise you're going to get lines all through your spreadsheet about circular reason so two choices with debt Equity where you can either use the industry average which is what I've done here or you can go with this debt to equity that came from your own estimated value equity I'm almost there I have a cost of equity I need a cost of debt and here I'm going to follow a much more conventional route with public companies which did not have a bond rating remember how I computed the cost of debt I compute an interest coverage ratio I went to a lookup table I came up with the rating and a cost to debt I can do that private companies as well and here I compute an interest coverage ratio based on the lease expenses I came up with a default spread based on the rating I gave them a double b plus rating and a cost of debt of seven and a half percent pre-tax and four and a half percent after tax so I've got a cost of equity from the total beta a cost of debt from the synthetic rating my cost to capital for the company is 13.25 percent I've got my discount rate using a private company evaluation much higher than the discount rate for for an otherwise similar public company because I'm using that total beta second stop I had to clean up the income statement cleaning up you're basically meant paying for a chef who's actually going to cook 150 000 that pushes up my expenses and I capitalize leases because that's the right thing to do now starting in 2019 accountants have done this with public companies but many private companies people still can expense operating leases so I'm capitalizing and treating it as dead so there's my restated operating income my operating income is 370 million instead of 400 million so I've got number I've got a discount rate I've got my earnings step three I'm going to stop and check to see how much of an effect the chef leaving is going to have I've replaced him with a new chef but remember one reason the restaurant is at capacity is because people coming in like the chef they like the food and I don't know how what percentage of those people will not show up next the next day if I buy the restaurant with a new Chef so I estimated that loss of Revenue that I'm going to get if the chef leaves to be 20 of my operating income so I'm going to take 370 000 and knock it down by 20 percent this is the key person discount we talked about towards the end of each class it's lower my lowering my operating so I've got a discount rate I started with the operating command adjusted it for the loss of a key person and again as a chef you might try to figure out ways to reduce this loss because it shows up as a lower value for you and you might stay on for a year or two maybe have some kind of adjustment process where the losses lower but if you don't do that there's going to be a 20 loss step four just because you're doing the private company doesn't mean you can forget all those rules we had in evalued public companies like what to grow you have to reinvest how much you have to reinvest depends on your return on Capital in this case I've estimated a return in capital of 20 for this privately owned restaurant and I'm going to give them a very low growth why because they're already at capacity they can't grow more than a certain number because you're you know every seat is taken so putting a two percent growth right two percent divided by 20 gives me a reinvestment rate of 10 percent so I've got my discount rate I've got my income I've got my reinvestment rate I bring it together in my valuation so there's the key person adjusted operating income growing at two percent next year one minus the tax rate times one minus three investment rate so that's expected free cash for the firm next year divided by cost of capital minus the growth rate I come up with a value for the restaurant of 1.449 million I'm almost done because there's one final step I have to subtract out the debt which in this case the present value the leases the value that I get for the restaurant is 521 000 dollars that's the value of equity in this restaurant five twenty one thousand what's the final adjustment for a liquidity right if I buy this restaurant is the investment banker and I put all my wealth into it what if I change my mind it's going to be very difficult to back up so to estimate that discount let's talk a little bit about the liquidity so I'm going to reinforce what I said at the start of the class today I mean the standard practice for a liquidity discounts is to knock a fixed number of I call this the bludgeon approach take 20 off every private company evaluation but I think the right practice is to allow it to vary across companies some companies should have bigger discounts than others healthy companies over on healthy companies money making over money losing should also depend on when you're trying to do this it's a market in the crisis the market doing well and should also reflect the buyers the buyer long-term buyer or cash constraint buy so now I want that intuition to be acceptable that that discount should vary across companies varying across time barrier across buyers because then we can talk about how to estimate the discount so let's start with that bludgeon discount 25 or 20 or whatever people use randomly those discounts come from two sets of studies both of which are hopelessly flawed in my view but people keep using them over and over again private company appraisal kind of got its build up from a guy called Shannon Pratt who in the early 1980s wrote the first book unwelling closely of confidence it was a legend in the space the first it's a thousand page book but all the it's a manual on what to do to Value private companies and one of the things of course you have to deal with is the liquidity discount so he set up uh you know set up a firm in Oregon called Williamette and they started doing research on the liquidity discount and the first sets of studies that backed up the discount were studies of what are called restricted stock and studies just before IPOs and to see why they give you a sense of what the liquidity discount is let me describe what restricted stock is it's publicly traded companies that issue shares with restrictions on you being able to trade the shares let's take an example let's suppose you have a stock that's trading at ten dollars per share so I come in and offer you a hundred thousand shares but it said by the way you can't trade for the next two years so you get those shares price right now it's ten would you pay me ten dollars for sure yeah you pay less a number right how much lesser friends right how much you care about liquidity but the advantages I can observe how much of a discount I get so to estimate the liquid discounts I need to observe what the price would be without the discount and the price with the discount with restricted stock I get to absorb this and there are dozens and dozens of studies of restricted stock and they seem to find a discount of about 30 to 35 percent it's a pretty big discount the second set of studies look at transactions before an IPO so the way these studies are structured is they take all companies that go public and then they look at the two to three months or even six months before the IPO to see how much of a price people charge for selling each other shares so the VC is selling a share to another VC how much of that they pay relative to the IPO price and there they find discounts for 40 50 percent this is great news for appraisers the discounts is so big you know what what happens if you apply a big discount you get a lower value you say why would that be good what do most private company appraisals for tax purposes Divorce Court you want as lower number as possible so for decades private company appraisers use these studies to back up these discounts they said look private companies you know you should attach a 30 discount we'll talk about the flaws with it but you can see the basis to these studies now when you look at their restricted stock studies many of the early studies just looked at the median discount they'd look at 15 or 20 or 50 different restricted stock offerings there aren't that many each year so it's got to be a small sample and they compute the median discount but they stop there that's a 30 25 percent in 1988 Bill silbo used to teach a foundation class he was a legend at Stern did a did a paper it's a paper that I think he did over a summary he laughed about it and said I never expected to catch on but basically took these restricted stocks offerings and he said rather than give you a meeting I'm going to look at why they vary across companies why are the discounts bigger at some companies and smaller at others and he ended up the paper with the with the regression right so as if you look at the left-hand side of the regression he looked at what the restricted stock price was as a percentage of the market price so it's one minus the discount so if the restricted stock price is eight dollars and the stock and the actual the market price before was ten eight divided by 10 is 0.8 so think of the left hand side as one minus the discount and he threw in three variables one is he threw in the level of Revenge his hypothesis was bigger companies should see smaller liquidated Wisconsin smaller companies let me back that up second he looked at you know what how big that restricted block was his argument was the larger the restricted block is relative to the number of shares outstanding the bigger the discount has to be so there are million shares outstanding and I'm trying to put a restricted block of a half a million I should see a much bigger discount than if I'm just selling 50 000 shares and he found that that was backed up as well he funded money making company so this Bern is a dummy variable it's a company money making or money losing he funded money making companies had smaller discounts and money losing companies and finally even through in just to see if there were any any deviations from arms length transactions whether the person buying the restricted chairs was the customer of the company his argument being you're trying to put restricted shares with a customer maybe they're getting side deals and they're willing to pay a higher price so you ran this regression and I you know it basically became a paper but a few years later I decided to steal Bill silber's regression and use it to kind of come up with the way of coming up with different in liquidated discounts for different companies it's still within the restricted stock study so it's got its limitations but here's what I did I looked at what the if using that regression what the discount would be for a company as a function of its revenues the larger the revenues the smaller the discount and whether it's a money making or a money losing company so let's say I'm an appraisal firm you come into my office and say hello I want you to value my firm I value your firm and I'm trying to estimate the discount to apply you have 25 million in revenues and you have a money making your money making firm my discard for you is going to be about 23 percent if you have 25 million revenues and your money losing firm my discount for you is going to be 32 if you're a billion dollar Revenue firm your discount is going to be far lower so in effect I'm not giving everybody the same discount I'm giving smaller discounts to bigger companies and I'm giving smaller discounts to money making companies a way of discriminating across companies but here's the problem with restricted stock studies that you cannot run away from no matter how much you finesse what did I say has to happen in a restricted stock offering I've got to offer a big discount right twenty percent thirty percent on the table what kind of healthy companies ever going to do that so if you look at these companies that issue restricted stock it turns out that you have a sampling bias the kinds of companies that issue restricted stock are small companies and trouble companies because they have no choice the kinds of people who sell their shares before an IPO there's an IPO in two months why do you sell it to share shares at 30 discounts because you're desperate that's a sampling bias and it took 20 years for the IRS to figure out how to use the sampling bias because with 20 years I know appraisers had gone to court and said look there's a 35 discount restricted stock study finally after 20 years the IRS actually hired somebody who knew enough statistics to take a look at these restricted stock studies and separate out how much of the 35 discount you were seeing came from the sampling bus there's actually statistical ways of doing this and at the end of the study concluded that about 20 to 25 of the 35 percent came from having a bad sample only about 10 to 15 percent was the liquidity discount there's a huge moment in private company appraisal because now when appraisers went in front of the court and said we're going to use a 35 discount you actually got pushback from judges saying but 20 of that is a sampling bias why are you using such a big discount so no matter how you slice it there's only so much you can do with restricted stock studies or IPO studies that too much there's too much sampling bias I'm not that interested in illiquated discounts it's not I don't work with private companies that much but I've struggled with is there a better way to estimate a liquidity scotch and I think there is and to see what it is remember what I said about buyers remorse to the public company I said there isn't a liquidity discount right it's called a bid ask spread he said how big can it be for an apple it's tiny 0.1 percent the beta spread divided by the price but if you decided to do this with a small NASDAQ stock lightly traded you know how much so it's a two dollar stock the bid ask spread could be 50 cents in other words if you buy the stock it'll cost you two dollars one second later you try to sell the stock you're gonna make back a dollar fifty that's a 50 Cent spread on a two dollar stock that's like having a 25 liquidated discount if I'm willing to define the bid ask spread as in the liquid think of how much bigger my sample is every publicly listed stock has a bid ask spread in the stock price I can compute that spread for every single store a sample size is 7500 publicly traded companies and about 15 years ago I decided I wanted to see why the spread as a person of price varied across companies the very fact that I have done it since shows you how painful it was that first time I said never again am I coming here but if you're a private company appraiser you might want to go there right I don't care that much but if you cared you could go and look at this so I have 7 500 companies in my spreadsheet I have the spread as a percentage of the stock price for every single company I did what Bill Silva did with his small restricted stock study I tried to figure out why the spread was higher for some companies and low for others and here were the variables that I threw to my regression I threw it how much the company had in revenues higher Revenue companies had much smaller bidas spreads than lower Revenue companies size the size of the company matter I threw in how much whether the company was money making or money losing turned out that money making companies have much lower bid aspects and money losing companies I threw in how much cash the company had as a percentage firm had why because companies with a lot of cash are already liquid they don't need a liquidity discount assume a company is 90 cash why would you have a discounted Company by 20 or 30 percent had much smaller spreads and companies with very little cash and I did throw in a trading variable and not surprisingly companies which have high trading volume have much smaller bid aspects in companies that don't trade as much you see what's this Got to Do With Private companies these are public companies are explaining differences differences in bid ask spreads across public companies take a look at this regression it could I get these numbers for my restaurant have the revenues right 1.2 million I can plug it in there is it a money making restaurant yeah sure it's money making but I put in one I can look at its balance sheet I can get cash as a percent of value and how often does this restaurant trade zero I'm just going to put in a trading volume of zero that's basically what I did I took my bid ask spread regression plugged in the values for the restaurant in here and I got a predicted bid ask spread for the restaurant 12.88 what does it even mean I'm extending the concept of bid aspects into the private business space and that now becomes my estimate of the liquidity discount given how public markets are being priced it doesn't have sampling bias it's a huge sample of course I can I like to keep redoing it this is a 15 year old regression so it's it's aged but if you made if this was at the center of your practice you could update this every year the data is there it's easy to do and you'd have an updated way of estimating what the illicited discount is at any point in time and you can vary it across companies based on the characteristics to show you how different these numbers are going to be than the traditional approaches come out of the restricted stock studies if I do the bludgeon approach where I just take 25 off as opposed to the refined bludgeon approach where I use the silver regression to kind of adjust it I get 25 27 28 is my discount if I use the bid ask spread approach you you get a much much smaller it might be a much more reasonable discontent value so that 12.88 is what I'm going to use as my liquidated discount which means that my 521 000 that I estimated the value of equity you take 12.88 off gives me a value of 454 000. it took a long journey to get there but in a buyer to buy a private buyer to private seller transaction this restaurant is worth about 454 000. you could see why I already private to private transactions are so massive first you can't use baits you got to adjust for the lack of diversification you got to come up with this liquidity discount after you're done to reduce value and every dark force and valuation is working against you as you go along because you have so many things that you feel uncomfortable about so that's private deprived any questions on private to private transactions so doctors selling his practice to another doctor you run into all of these issues yeah yes right the r squared is about 35 it was not I mean I could have made it better I stopped after four variables because I just got tired now because the sample size was 7 500 I could have had seven or eight variables the only thing to remember is you put those variables in they've got to be variables you can get for private companies as well so you don't want to bring in any market-based variables like a dividend yield wouldn't work because you don't have a market price so you can use any kind of book value based number anything that comes off income statements and balance sheets and if you wanted a higher r squared you could get there because spreads are pretty explainable and the other Advantage is if you do this on an updated basis they would reflect the marketer and write right now if you're in a crisis this spreads for all companies go up it'll show up in The Intercept so it's a kind of a dynamic constantly adjusted approach where you can get spreads that reflect the time you're in so that's private to private let's go to the other end of the spectrum they're a private business and you're thinking of selling yourself and there's a public buyer interest so you play the role of a public buyer now public buyer in what sense you're a public company interested in buying my private business first let's go back to the beta you know remember the private to private I adjust the market bait into the total beta if you're a public buyer which pages should you go with you're a company but you're investing other people's money right your investors in your company are they Diversified yeah public to private to public I go back to a market beta because I don't have to worry about this diversification issue so instead of using the 2.36 beta I'm going to go back to the 1.18 beta second on the liquidity discount issue you're a public company you're buying this illiquid private company what happens after it becomes part of your company where people can still trade your shares liquidity comes from people having to trade their shares a public company does not have to Discount value for a liquidity because its investors can get liquidity by buying and selling shares they're not to buy and sell assets so the market beta is going to go back to a total beta I'm sorry total weight is going to go back to Market beta the liquidity discount will disappear so we need to make the beta adjustment you can already see the drop off in my costly Capital so instead of 13.25 I'm going to go with the public company costed capital of 8.76 percent and my value which is 454 000 will now go to 1483. so notice the liquid discount is gone I'm using a market beta this is very much like every valuation we've done so far in this class so if you have a private company being sold to a public company you can pull up the template you had for valuing public companies and get away with it so you have two values here right for this company as a for this restaurant 453 000 to a private buyer but 1.483 billion a billion to a 453 000 and 1.483 million to a public part so let's say I'm the public buyer and you're the restaurant so you have two numbers ready for it four fifty three three thousand one thousand four eighty three which one are you going to start your negotiation with let's see if you're you know whether I'm going to get an easy buyer so you're selling your company you have bought these numbers you've computed both which one are you going to start you're going to start at the 1483 and you're going to tell me the story right which I'm a public company I should think about Market beta liquidity doesn't matter how am I what am I going to counter you with which is I don't care what I look like you're a private company and your next best alternative is a another private buyer so I'm going to start at 453 000. and if I'm the only game in town I'm the only public buyer and everybody else is a private buyer guess who's going to end up winning this game I'm going to end up getting it for close to 453 000. but if you can get a second public buyer interested in you then we might start bidding against each other and push the value up to 1483 million next week we're going to just now a week after next I'm going to talk about acquisitions and have a very cynical view that most Acquisitions destroy value at company so when companies try to grow through acquisition this but there's a there's a big chunk of the process that's going to make it more likely that you will lose value than increase value but I'm going to point to one of the few cases where doing Acquisitions can be value created it's when a public company buys private businesses either to create a roll-up business you're not a roller businesses you basically buy a bunch of private companies you roll them up into a public company Blockbuster now of course it's gone built itself up as a company by buying small video rental stores around the country bundling them up and becoming a public company Browning fares which is a garbage disposal Company went around the country buying small privately owned garbage disposal companies and but you see why there's a potential for Value creation because what do I do as a public company then when I when I I I offer you up a premium over the 453 000. you feel you're winning right because your next best offer is 450. I offer you 550. you think you're you know you walk away from the table feeling good but I walk away from the table feeling good as well because I paid you 550 000 for something that's worth 1.48 million I'm not ripping you off because your next best alternative would be in a private transaction but you can see how this process plays out where if you're looking for the best potential buyer that best potential buyer for you as an owner of a private business is often going to be a publicly traded company so again let me emphasize it's not that publicly traded companies are Diversified the investors these companies are Diversified so they don't have to worry about total beta it's not that a liquidity doesn't matter but a liquidity doesn't matter to them because their investors can buy and say yes they get the liquidity a different way and that's where the increase in value is coming from so I've looked at two extremes here right I've got a private business that's completely undiversified our private buyer is completely undervised by our public company that's completely Diversified you see where a private Equity Fund Falls between these two spectrums a private Equity Fund is never completely Diversified they have a sector Focus or Regional Focus so you're partially Diversified so I'll take an example let's say you have a software business you sell it to another individual is completely undiversified you compute the correlation of your company with the market and you come up with like 0.2 so it gives you a high total beta in contrast you take that same software business and you sell it to a software BC who is invested in 25 software companies so here's my question one software company correlation is point two you take a portfolio of 25 software companies and you look at the correlation with the market is it going to be higher than 0.2 lower than 0.2 what's going to happen when I create a portfolio of software companies it's going to get higher because some of the risk in the software companies very company specific risk so when I create a portfolio software companies the correlation I'm going to get my 3.4 or 0.5 you see what's going to happen the venture capitalist is now going to have a lower beta than the individual buyer and the vet and the Venture Capital beta will be lower than uh will be higher than the market beta that is offered by the so you can see this process where you start off with a completely undiversified buyer then you get partially Diversified buyers and it ends with fully Diversified buyers either because you go public or you get acquired by a public company so it's a process that plays out almost all of the time there are a few private companies that stay on as private right I remember they they used to have this auction at Stern I don't know whether they still have it but if they have it I've kind of withdrawn from it but they always come to professors and say can you offer something we can sell what am I going to offer other than I'll value a company so I put that into the bed and usually people are better a couple of hundred dollars or 300 they get a business valued they walk away happy I walk away not unhappy so we're we're both okay so one one auction it ends up that this particular thing goes for a couple of thousand I said why would somebody pay a couple of thousand dollars or just have a company back so I you know I wait and this MBA comes in he's a first year MBA and he's got this big stack of financials with him and he says he says that your company's Financial he says yes and what does the company do he says it makes rump so where are you from it's in Miami you know the company you wanted me to value US Bacardi still a private leader you're saying why is it privately owned you drink enough of your product after a while you forget about diversifiable risk non-diversifiable risk total risk I mean they stayed private for 100 or no 150 years it's actually a fun company to value because I mean the corporate governance issues obviously because you had multiple measures like the third or the fourth generation family members all over the place it's obviously a niche product it's got a brand name so that was a case where a private company stayed private notwithstanding the Expressions most private companies so buckle at some point and either become part of public companies or go public themselves so I want to be make sure everybody gets it private to private use total betas put in a liquidated discount you're going to get a low value private to public use Market balance there's no liquidated discount it looks very much like a public company valuation private to venture capital or private Equity Fund you're somewhere in the middle you're not your betas are not as high as they were with the private buyer then they're not as low as they will be with a public buyer but effectively it captures that transition from being a privately owned company to a publicly traded company so let's look at the third scenario private company evaluation as a lead-in to an initial public offer so now you're valuing the company not because you want to sell to a private buyer or a public buyer because you want to go public so I want to talk about the issues that come up when you value companies ahead of ips is everybody familiar about the process of IPOs a company wants to go public what's the first thing they need to do they need to file a prospectus with the SEC and around the world there are variations same thing but you file a prospect what's a prospect is it looks like a 10K for a private company right so it has all of the information that you have in a 10K so one of the nice things about valuing private companies ahead of an IPO is you're now looking at financials that covered by gaap and IFRS so if you have to capitalize leases you've got to do it in the Prospectors as well they'll give you the history of the company so to start with you're looking at num at data very similar to what you to Value public on but there are issues that are specific to private companies that I want to talk about in the context of an IPO evaluation is a valuation I did of Twitter ahead of their IPO in 2013. usually when companies file their Prospectors if the company I'm interested in I value the company right after the prospect is is fought I did this with Alibaba I did it with Twitter I do it right after the prospect is his filed because there's no bias in the process no market price out there there's no banking price out there I have a clean slate I can come up with the number it's kind of on you know unsettling because you have nothing to compare it to but I came up with the value of about 17 per share for the company and if you look at the valuation it looks very similar to a public company evaluation it's got reinvestment rates and cash flows basically it's a three-step approach Revenue growth margin sales to Capital so you can take that fcff ginzoo plug in the numbers for any Prospectors you can you can come up with evaluation of the company but there are a couple of twists with IPOs that you have to build into the valuation so if you want to use my spreadsheet value in IPO here's the first thing you have to think about one is when you go public on the offering day you issue shares to investors and you get cash in return right you have to tell me what you plan to do with the cash you see what do you mean what do you mean what are the different choices a company has when it comes to cash raised in an offering what can it do yep one is you get set it aside for future reinvestment obviously you don't reinvest the day after but after the IP you can put into your cash balance and use it to cover those negative free cash flows to equity you had that you estimated are now going to be covered with that cashback so it increases your cash balance okay so that's one choice raise Capital put into cash balance use it a couple of future reinvestments what else can it do you know what Spotify did in their IPO they issued shares they got money and they let existing owners cash out so Sony was an investor in Spotify Sony wanted not to be an invest in the public company so they let someone so owners cash out so cash comes in leaves almost instantaneously so second thing you could do is let existing owners cash out the third thing you can do is use the cash to pay it on Venture debt or debt you might have taken on is Bridge financing to get it off the books you need to tell me what you plan to do with the proceeds in evaluation and every Prospect is there will be a section on what a company plans to do with the proceed so pick up a prospectus of a high profile company read through the Prospectors get to that section because you need that section so we're going to talk about what to do in the case of Twitter the IPO proceeds were a billion dollars you will notice that it gets added on to the value why because the day after the IPO your cash balance is going to increase by a billion and Twitter told me that they were going to keep the proceeds in the company everything else about this valuation I've kind of done pretty much what I've done with the public company but let's talk about the issues that our IPO specific two of these issues are valuation specific one is and I talked about this already the proceeds what do you plan to do with the proceeds the other is the way private companies are built up often requires them to go to venture capitalists over and over again Twitter had seven BC rounds before it went public you think so what each time you have a VC round you raise Capital prevention Capital you often create a new class of shares Twitter at seven classes of convertible preferred chats reflecting their seven rounds the pain in the neck right and what am I going to do with seven seven class of shares they're also because they were a young company used restricted stock and options to reward their employees so by the time they went public they already had built up this backlog of trade things that could drain your Equity back that's going to be true in any company but without with young companies going public it can be a particularly problematic issue that's the valuation issues they're also pricing issues which means that in a typical IPO here's how it works you want to go public what's the first thing you do you hire a banker so you find one and what does a banker do for you at least what does a banker claim you will do for you or she will do for you they'll first help you write the Prospectors so they have the infrastructure for doing that they'll help they'll tell you they will value your company when in fact they will price your company but that's okay we'll let them use the word value what else do I custom for IPOs for young companies planning to go public they will do a road show which means the bankers will wear expensive suits go around the country do nice looking charts multiple font sizes different colors but along the way they might give you some information about the company what else they will basically get on the old days get on the phone and get onto clients or portfolio managers look we're going public with Twitter you know would you be interested and they'll frame it in a way if this is your last chance to get into this deal at the ground floor you've heard it right you've got an electronic store you're basically you're getting the banking pitch in a lower form but it's the same kind of thing you know and then they give you one final it looks out they actually guarantee the price they will take you public at that's amazing right what about a realtor and I said I can guarantee the price I can sell you sell your house at you know why you should pay nothing for that guarantee what did I forget to tell you I forget I forgot to tell you the price can I sell your price I guarantee I can sell your house at 20 below them anybody can do that and that's what Bankers do they they offer an underwriting guarantee but the guaranteed price is off in 15 or 20 below what do you what they think the price should be and there's one final thing they do which is after the company goes public at least in theory they offer what's called aftermarket support which means if somebody's trying to sell your shares they'll often come in and buy the shares to offer support to a limited except they don't have unlimited resources so those are the services that Bankers claim to offer and in return for that what do they get six to eight percent of the proceeds so if you raise 100 million at six to eight million dollars that is the process companies have used for the last century the process is getting frayed we'll talk about why but that is the process we use but a key part of that process is an underwriting guarantee so let's talk about the valuation issues first then we'll come back to the pricing issues as I said the three things you can do with the cash one is you can keep the cash the company as part of your cash balance and use it to cover Future Care packs the second is you can let owners cash out and the third is you can use the cash to pay down debt if you decide to take the cash out of the company let owners cash out I can completely ignore the cash you see why because I raised cash to one window it goes out through the other window it doesn't change my values of company so in Spotify the proceeds from the IPR net don't even show up in your valuation they're just gone if you keep the cash on the balance sheet there's going to be an immediate augmentation of your value by the amount of cash you've raised because that's cash now that increases your cash balance and you use the cash to pay down debt how does it show up in your evaluation what happens when you pay down debt your debt ratio goes down your cost of capital is different so it might affect your discount rate it might affect your failure rate remember we talked about failure rates and how they can affect the value of young companies might affect your failure rate so what you do with the proceeds depends very much on what the company plans to use for projects second stop in the case of Twitter they're actually in their prospectus told me that they're going to use the billion dollars in proceeds to hold this cash it is required as part of the prospectus to specify what you plan to do with the proceeds and Twitter's you know Twitter says judgment was they would keep the cash balance second cleanup right you all these different claims I can't value the equity in a company when there's seven different classes of convertible preferred stock to deal with luckily for you and companies go public one of the things that happens is all these different classes of stock will get converted to Common shares in the case of Twitter what made my life easier was all seven classes got converted into common shares they still had restricted shares that I have to deal with and options outstanding but they did clean up at the time of the prospects and that too should be specified in the Prospectors they'll tell you how many shares there will be outstanding after all of these convertible preferred chance get converted into common shares but in the case of Twitter there's there's two things that I think they left us Loose Ends which I tend to find in most Prospectors one is there are tons and tons of restricted stock that for whatever reason they excluded from their share company they're actually pretty open they'd say there are 337 million shares outstanding the company oh by the way we have excluded the 73 million restricted shares why it's because you feel like it sometimes it's because they're non-vested you know what the keyword best studio means right you've got to stay on long enough to get those shares we're going to ignore them because they're not invested that doesn't mean they'll never get busted here's my advice to you don't take the share count that you see in the Prospectors that the company gives you look through the exclude shares because many of those restricted I took all of the restrictions and add them on to the share con so my share card is actually very different from the investment banking share con that went out that day because I counted the restricted shares they also had 44 million options what do we do with options publicly traded companies what's the right way to deal with options we value them as options and that's exactly what I did here with one catch when I valued options publicly traded companies I use the market price to Value the option because I had one here I don't have a market price I use the intrinsic value per share I estimated the 17 to Value the options that value for the options was 805 million I'm going to subtract that from the value of equity in fact you saw that in the big picture to get to the value of equity in the company so I'm doing exactly the same thing I did with public companies just more work with private companies because you don't have a market price and finally the investment banking guarantee as I said it sounds too good to be true right somebody guarantees a price but the problem is because the guarantee it's Investment Banking guaranteed affects how Bankers said offering prices on ships so let's play a game Let's suppose your price shares in the company come up with twenty dollars which let's say you've done it reasonably well you feel pretty comfortable that that's the right price twenty dollars per ship you're going to offer me a guarantee on that price right because you're offering a guarantee you want to Discount the price you give me or add a premium to that price what's going to make your life easier if you set the price at zero think how much easier life would be you can't do that but you're going to try to discount it by how much it's amazing if you're going to work for an investment Bank in the IPO section if you look at manuals it's actually written right there in the manual value the company now price the company take 15 off it's like a discount that applies all the time and it's okay so you price the company and how do you price the company we talked about the kabuki dance you can go through of acting like you're doing a DCF but in pricing a company you look at a metric use a multiple you come up with the pricing in fact I showed you my Twitter pricing was based on how many users they had and applying a hundred dollars per user Where'd I get the hundred dollars per user by looking at publicly traded companies in the space and looking at what the market was paying per user it's my pricing of the company and then once I get the pricing I'm going to Discount that price but that discount creates a little bit of a potential people look at and say the original papers and IPOs actually called it the IPO puzzle and explain a minute why they called the puzzle and here's what they found so you have an offering price and on the opening day of trading you have a starting price for the stock right so the offering price is set at thirty dollars Market opens for trading doesn't open at 30 it opens at 34 35 36 on the offering day on average the IPO stock price increases by about 15 percent sounds like a way to make money right so tell me how you how you would exploit this to make money start a mutual fund for me that takes this crap and say I'm going to make money on this guy what are you going to do this I mean shorted when after it's gone public because that would require the price to drop yeah the price is jumping you shorted at you can't first you can't short at the offering price it's not trade it's you'll have to wait till it's traded now so maybe there's a shorting strategy down the road but I want a strategy for the opening day what might you do yeah starting in a mutual fund here's what you're going to do you're going to buy a thousand shares in every IPO that comes up in the next year you should make money hand over fish right and mutual funds have tried this and they don't make money so tell me what the slip is between the cup and the lip that leads these the this 15 that you see on paper to kind of dissipate so let's play this through you have 100 IPOs coming up you write to each banker and ask for a thousand shares in each RPO are you going to get a thousand shares in every IPO yeah because Bankers have to ration based on what demand and supply so if you have an offering which is over subscribed by 500 percent this has nothing to do with playing favorites you're going to get only one in five shares that you asked for because there are five times more money so you're gonna get 200 shares in that company if a subscribe if an offering is under subscribed you're going to get all thousand shares to see what's going to happen right at the end when you look at your portfolio you're going to have 200 shares in all the most underpriced companies and a thousand shares in the most overpriced conference so when you look at the Returns on your phone he said what happened what happened was you didn't get an equally weighted portfolio yeah you got a portfolio that's overweighted with stocks were overpriced and underweighted it so if you're planning to make money on IPOs you can't just in buy every IPO if you have a way of discriminating across IPOs to figure out which ones are underpriced and which ones are overpriced maybe but that'll require actually pricing the IPO to see which ones are most likely to see this picture so making money on IPOs is not easy because of this fact that you don't get all of the shares you want in this companies you want you want to get them in but you get all the shares you want the companies you don't want to get them in and that's not a good end game to be as an investor but there's another aspect of this discount that troubles people this is where the puzzle comes in you're the founder of a company you've spent the last five years working 20 hours a day building up this company along the way you've accumulated Venture capitalism took a lot of risk has this company built up right you decide to go public and let's say your fair price is twenty dollars and I did put a 15 discount on that price when I set the offering price out of your pockets and the question that people often ask is why do founders go along with this why do they allow Bankers to knock 15 off so let's say you have a 10 billion dollar company 15 of 10 billion is 1.5 billion right that you leave on the table or is it that's if you show all of the shares at the offering but in a typical offering you offer only about 10 of the shares but still 15 of that but you might be okay with it why because the day after the offering what do you see as a Wall Street Journal article on your company stock price jump on offering day what do you hope will happen other people read this story and then what would they do what human beings have done through the history of investing which is they will now try to buy the stock you know what a lost leader in department stores lost leaders are those things they put in the table to suck you further and further into the store yeah socks at 20 cents you don't need socks but 20 cents you know might as well buy them just in case they're not even your size Etc cheap so lastly do you basically selling stuff for below cost because you want me to get to the Ralph Lauren section which is near the fifth table and the moment of weakness by a 200 sweater that I don't need right this is like a lost leader you're willing to accept the discard because you hope it will draw more people into the stock and push up the stock price so if you're wondering why this existing processes survive the way it has it's because nobody in this process actually has that many problems with the process as long as you discount about 15 or 20 percent if it stock price doubles in the offering day clearly you're going to be much more upset as a Founder but for a long time people got along with this process but in the last few years people have started questing the process let's go through the services Bankers claim to offer okay first is they help you write the prospectus chat GPT could do it for you have you ever read prospectuses they come out of a template it's almost like the same guy writes every Prospectors they use the same language so there's not that's not rocket science I could you know you don't need a banker to do it they price your company really this is what they do and the price doubles on the first day that's not great pricing I probably have asked my doorman to price the stock and it'll be better pricing so that's not very good or they sell your company they you know get investors to buy a company that they don't recognize because Goldman Sachs is battery that might work for a company nobody's heard of but in the day Facebook went public I'll wager more people had heard of Facebook than of Morgan Stanley the lead investment banker I don't need Morgan Stanley to tell the world who I am everybody already knows who I am you see what I'm saying all those services that Bankers used to offer as special services have essentially become less and less valuable and I'm paying six to eight percent so a few years ago bill Gurley said why didn't we cut the banker out of the equation it struck there in the hearts of Bankers this is these are not words they want here cut the bank what do you mean cut the banker out of the process he said why don't you just go directly to the market it's called a direct listing the direct listing you know what to do you specify the opening day we're going to start trading on May 15th there's no offering price you're saying what what are we going to do how do markets at prices demand and Supply to open up there's demand there's Supply there's there's no discount on the price it's much fairer because nobody's getting the sh the shares at a special price it's called a direct list the only problem with direct listings is right now the the status quo doesn't like it the SEC believe that direct listings are potentially unfair to investors because they have this feeling that investors will be taken advantage of by Fly by Night companies that go public they feel they actually believe that Bankers are your defense against getting scammed I don't know what the SEC is drinking but I don't see Bankers as my defense so their View and the way they constrain direct listings in a direct listing today you're not allowed to keep the cash you raise in a direct listing that's why Spotify actually I had to let owners cash out because they made a direct listing it wasn't a traditional IPO so the direct listings have not taken off the way they could Act without those constraints and in the last three years there has been a third way to go public right go to spax what are you doing a spec do you want to tell me describe what is what you don't expect so you start a spec so first you have to be a high profiler or low profile investor to be a great question right high profile so what do you do you raise money from people to do a public offering of whom you don't specify I said trust me I'll find a company for you so you trust him you trust them why because they have a track record they know technology they find a company for you and they negotiate and a price for you trust me I'll negotiate a good price for you and for all of this trust what do you have to pay so much 20 specs take twenty percent of the money so they raise 100 million 20 million goes into this is a great now you see why it started what 16 different specs you take the 20 off and take the remaining 80 million with that 20 cut it's never going to take off but the process is getting shaken up and I don't know how it'll evolve but I think we're going to see change in the IPO process because the existing way of going public is not working and the new ways are not good enough yet to make the switch so on Monday please bring your last package so I'll send you the link so you can download it because we're going to talk about option pricing on Mondays if you want to look at your option pricing notes from foundations that's good but I assume not that we started a very quick review and then going to real options yes 
foreign it folks quick reminder of all the things whatever of all the things that you need the most as a teacher you know the you could I can lose my slides I'm okay I've got a class without slides I've actually taught a class with no power the power and dog we gather together the one thing I can't afford to lose is my voice and today I'm getting awfully close to the edge of losing my voice in third session I mean the good news is I don't have covet the bad news is I sound like I have which means you're coughing not to learn that's my my last thing I want to do is of course give you an excuse to listen to quiz on Wednesdays [Music] whatever videos [Music] but before we do that I want to do today I use today start with class tested like the last four patients I mean think about what you're talking about by the companies we talked about the difficulties of a private to private recognize what are the biggest difficulties that if you use private to privacy in fact uh they may not be Diversified and diversified buyers we've talked about the niceness of a private to public transaction between like the public company okay well as an investment the Diversified liquid disease leadership and we talked about private to IPL which is mostly like a public company but because they're trying to build the offering first there's one fighter transition I want to talk about of a private company that is in the process the things that can go public but as we stepped along so I'm going to make easy players so these are going to be the founder of the software account yeah Jake is going to be a DC and Asia is going to be a public market event right so deep start the business lots of potential thank you two years already expecting like Jane into the company [Music] needs to get more investments before but all in the software 30 software accounts and three million years later this goalie planning where you know has been trouble better and somebody's doing it anywhere If You're Expecting both public connection from U.S investors buying their shares you know because then my latex fund is buying a company in addition is one so for the first two years while he was running the company what are they going to see us his correlation the correlation with typical software about the market is going to cry it's completely undiversified the Turks innovator one who's going to see a rate of four and his cost of equity is going to be 24 but it's pre-rated really for two years give me a day that Jake comes to the company he needs more Diversified but not completely Diversified remember when you're 30 software companies you will do some of the company specific with right because individual software companies they price running by trying to work the correlation of Jake's foot program the market is 0.5 so when you look to the same company exactly the same company still the beta people you see it is not four but two right and trying to do an issue within the company five years later the same company same one letter data she's Diversified sheet needs of 801 and an automatically so 24 14 languages makes valuations every night and yet one discount cash flow we take the precache from the form we discount them in this case let's prepare for that free cash or equity which is going back to the cost of it the cost of equity is 24 for the first few years because deep and undiversified 14 for the next three years and then nine percent when it becomes foreign value what about these costs of equities if you discount the cash flows and those yes and the terminal value don't forget the terminal value also has to come back to this and the reason the intuition land why we need positive I put into the first five years discounts I could live through the first five years to get to your private all the risk I face is going to be built into that Equity changes you cannot use the present value function selling all the personality functionally calculated because the value function anywhere why because the present value as soon as this celebrated to save every year the accumulating cost of Revenue which is also distributed in cost of cabinets stretching is designed to allow for that value this company if you adjust the discovery for changing diversity it's the same time the only reason we have different positive equities not because the company changed it but it doesn't buy it the invested the margin that is really very expensive if I had stayed with one class of equity if you do it right I can go with the 24 cost of equity all the way I've seen the people do the same cost of equity electron make it the cost if I put it forever the value that I get is much much lower 1.62 billion and if I go with a nine percentage public company I come up with to but take a look at this equation already you can see some implications for how the private you know company business was shifted over the last five years now if you go to the 1980s and 90s if you were a startup the only place you could go for external Capital Adventure capitalism magic happens then you stacked purple so what's happened in the last 20 years and you have an intellectual investors into the DaVinci Capital One Thing many of whom are divorced by like who like Fidelity Kingdom of Christ so Jay consider being I don't know book of magic happens and being a two-year-old press you know what it doesn't have to be collected that's what he answered they're up to nine percent in which gave to incentives disappeared right because I'm already giving you a public company evaluation without any of the pain of being about to come like what the stores requirements of the government see you can already see why private companies especially in the last decade because it shows if they cracked then if you could have gone public five years earlier than you did Google could have gone public in 2014 they chose to make in 2019. let me think of how much they were able to grow without any energy disaster I think that's the unhealthy aspect of this gray Market that has developed but this gives you a way of thinking about it so but as you walk through those strong women private company evaluations remember there's a market beta that applied to another food investment that doesn't change what changes is how much of the additional risk in the company thing will continue Diversified investment none of it is we are completely underperformed investor all of it is if you're partially Diversified any questions go public at all but that's a good question at some point we've seen one to cash up that's the problem the biggest Invasion Benchmark invested in a group of one billion dollars and 90 billion like you want to think that money are the things so especially if you think the price is getting too hot for you so the need to cash out at some point in time will push the company so let's close this up I hope if you didn't bring packet three don't worry I mean you can get back when you get back at least download it but I'm going to talk about real option options to talk about themselves so you guys all remember okay about 30 minutes bringing you up to speed on basic option pricing because without it everything else becomes academic right so let's start by thinking about what this real option no real options are hot right every every consulting firm every Bank in fact people talk about optionality all machines or China can have that you see let's talk about the real value option in fact I'm going to argue that optional income anytime you can delay you can expand on what you've already done you can abandon things you've started it's you know when we talk about flexibility we're only talking about optionality right like somebody basically capacity to walk away so I'm going to start by giving you a very simple example of where option real option value comes from it's a very simplistic example of understanding illustrates why there is this Premier test because we're all the real options are going to allow you to add a screen details remember yourself at 32 it's really really really want to buy the share I don't know if it is a little bit of hope of getting from 40 to 52 that's what the often are doing so it's a very simplistic effect you have a gamble 50 chance of winning 50 chance of building if you win you make 100 billion would be loser you lose 120 million would you take the devil too long what's the expected that let's find a step forget about risk if this is already so this is a terrible gamble right I'm gonna take this guy and go ahead and add a name and it's going to do some magical thing so it's what I've done here is taken the Gamble and broken it up two parts first part you take the gambling in a small slice if there's a 75 chance it's identification you make 20 million and a 25 chance of rain in this case if you succeed only if you succeed get that upside then you continue there's a two-third chance of making 80 million and a one-third chance of making or losing 100 compare the two examples you take the losses you're minus 100 minus one minus 20 that's minus 120 the upside is 80 plus 20 100 two thirds and three quarters of the half so basically it looks like be the same kind of dependence right fifty percent chance of think that's fifty percent chance of failure with one qualifier which that broken the investment in two parts a smaller part where you get to observe and happy and then what adapt if you get a positive outcome in that first party continue to get a negative outcome itself that's at the basis of all your options are there first part of the argument is based on the fact that your judge something happening out there and the second part if you adapt the way you behave based on what you would say something currently access right the tradition is we project that we expect the number of bears the more you put itself time to inspected always right again inspected cash where you just not back in the risk it just the distance is everything but the Casual respected always expected production you know what you're missing in the evaluation what do oil companies get to observe before they decide your own friends the oil prices lower what do they do they're not locked into the harmony producers so they produce less than you expect even the oldest person when the oil press attack you see what this means in terms of the actual cash regard they're going to be higher than your cash numbers so we're opening up a very very dangerous story because in a sense we're opening the door to something we're all part of the start of every finances to talk Capital budgeting cash once competitive relationship investing come up with uh would we get any competitive [Music] so before you do this you want to make sure you're doing it for the right ways so there are three basic questions I'm going to kind of ask and address before I let you open the book first is when should I even be using an option pricing on when is there an option embedding your decision let's start I mean I have a paper in my website at around 20 years ago all opportunities are not options the reason I wrote that is why are people talking about how China was an option AI is an option automated driving is an option everything is an option right now an opportunity they're big auction but they're not necessarily large so I'm going to talk like when is it appropriate to bring in this word option into the discussion second when does that option of significant economic fact so I'm going to give you the key word then to decide whether that's it and third assuming it is significant economic value we know what the Varian is going to drive to that is an option when can I use an option pricing model to Value the option we spent the last few years developing the architectural value options that shows binomial when it boosted architecture drives an option so when is there an option in a decision when does an option of significant economic value can that randomly be estimated using adoption prices so let's start with the first question what makes an option you know same question material what are the ingredients that allow you to look at the exact same option tell me what it means first I'll give you a clue but I'll actually started be agreement and right the release of the Bible you need if you need a house I know it's a terrible thought to have it reaches all over your body but there's going to be a contingency foreign the key word there is right as opposed to what there's no obligation you get the right which means you can choose your exercise and choose not correctly there's an underlying acid there is a contingency built around the right and we should not do exercises we throw the option but even whatever you think yeah so that's what makes for an option is a factor so with every real option that I'm going to talk about I'm going to be clear right up front about you that's the underlying that I said and about the contingency because without doing it we're going to gonna be no answer and of course the other way you can always tell when there's an option is and know it makes option payoff diagnosed to meet you saw them sort of effects what makes option Pay Direct payoff diagram to me is you have limited losses and potentially unlimited problems why what's the most you can lose on the launch let's say buy a car launcher whatever your papers what's the most you can make hard only knows so I'll go to 50 000 you make the people so that's the unlimited profit so that's the way in the case of a good option you flip things around again you have limited losses you have none unlimited profits why yeah but the essence of options give limited losses and potentially variness problems find it away because it's going to drive how we think about the value of options the first job is should I even be talking about options it's not a pair of diagram from each of my real options I'm going to give you what I see it that they are diagnet and in the process I've had to specify what the underlying as it is and what they can do any questions up to that second question this is the big one this is where for every 100 option to run into 95 drop off today I'm going to ask you this significant economic value significant economic value since divided to the key word for me is the word exclusive and if you and only you have the right to do something you have significant economic attacks if you win 15 000 other people have the right to do the same thing your values need to take very quickly you and everybody has walked in the face of the Earth can do what you claim you can do there is no option exclusivity so we're going to talk about tax assumptions what gives the company like that the fact is as long as law enforcement and this is key and your Court's been built it in we're going to talk about undeveloped oil Reserves as options but it explicitly come from there there's only so much foreign you can see why many arguments are optionality already AI this is how you get here okay I don't know and I said option every one second she said yeah I could be a big market and I said I must have missed the memo but where did it say that Microsoft was the only person allowed in this market in the flash drive that artificial there is a lot of people make and they argument would have to be built much more carefully that Microsoft has been the first company to be in AI in an aggressive way maybe a first mover with them with that it's not exclusivity but I have competitive advantage but exclusive with the arguments of where the economic land of an opportunity so let's say you would pass the question there is no option you ask that exclusively question it looks like there is exclusive you know there's an office where the options we know we're trying to learn there are only six things that drive valuable knowledge let me list the six variables that determine the value of an arch please relate to the underlying Act the first is the value the underlying eyes and as that value goes up and down the value remember you got the right to buy something at a fixed price if that's something it doubles in price that right became more valuable because it affects price because the underlying acid value goes that call off should become more valuable options second and this is the magical part of options and the variance in that value increases the value of all options includes very intent because everything you said about this so far right we've already talked about this early in the class what is it about option that makes Mr Anna the payoff diagrams limited losses remember we said nobody else nice awake at night and I wonder what the opposite risk in business it's always downside reason if I take that away this is now your friend third any expected dividends you receive on the asset will reduce the value recall options and increase the value time what happens when it doesn't even have to be pregnant because of a chance let's hear 50 star we expected dividend number gone in two weeks from now what's going to happen a few weeks from now on today thanks give it a day with your daughter if you did it on the face it's called the ex-dividend there it's like has to happen otherwise you could make tons of money buying stock just before the ex-dividend collecting the price so if you're a call off you know there is expect dividends on the stock or any answer the bag would drop because the difference it's a smaller company the highest dividends go up or expect the dividends on all other people become less valuable good options become more valuable for the right to get the right to sell everything the three variables relating to the underlying answer every chair on that talk about the option itself there are two characters in the outcome that drive the option back the first is the striker is the right to buy at a lower price more value for the less value between the right to buy an item the right divided lower price is more valuable you rather if I need to direct the buyer apart with fifty thousand dollars price options become more valuable put options for coming like that if you get the right percentage and the life of the art increases the value of an option getting more time to play they got nothing you spot the option giving you three years to play the game rather than three minutes two relating to the auction there's one macroeconomic barrier that affects the diet of auction and it's whatever that is it's a really exciting it's okay with what is the risk related effect because I found a call option I get the right device why would having a higher risk period effect when do I have to pay the price two years from now right now because I need to write it by two years to now if your screen dates go up the present value of what I have to say becomes smaller so let's see that it's a five thousand percent I'm basically getting this stuff for free if you're crazy as risk free rates go up all options become more valuable because you pay less in present value of those and put options again programmable because here is I'm turning this value because because you're receiving that money but it's not worth it that's it those are the six barriers of course you're saying how do I go from bad to the value of an option that's where an option price is a little bit of history on option price until 1971 the way people write it off to retrieve their lifespan of order Paul Samuelson had an option pricing model developed in the 60s where you took the options with all the payoff very success elaborate complexion 1971 Fisher black and modern show broke that process open with a very simple recognition they said if you have an option a difficult option I can create something that looks exactly like the chord option by combining the underlying acid and either borrowing online order application okay what do you think exactly like the call option you know after all when you buy something it's all about cash flows right so you tell me the cash flows and an option and I can create something that looks exactly like that off in terms of that word right why did the Arbitrage argument matter what it doesn't say in cash flow they have to sell at the same price so I know the price of the replicating portfolio that's what I have the price of the options replication It's Magic even if you don't like the look of options let's face it they make you in order to calculate the exponential button you know if you touched it in four years the small metal and big Airline you said what is all this stuff well much of it is like the look of the mind it's an extraordinary elegant model in terms of power so let's spend in this time and recognition because I think people look at it they kind of get it but it doesn't work here's what replication is in real call option I can create something that looks exactly like the color in terms of cash flow by borrowing money and buying share in your life they say how many shares how much you borrow with the answer that first so we have a call option borrowing and buying sharing could create something that looks like it's called a synthetic form evil production selling short the underlying notice it and investing in that money will create exactly the same cash flow in something listed when creating exactly the same cash version but notice replication here requires support require them to be able to trade the underlying item system so to be able to create the option that you'll be able to borrow and earn money that's dispensing the third idea it's something that grounded all over the place it's not the victim the first two are critical did you have a call option an idea in a trade the underlying acid IBM shift I think right then I trade the auction so you can see my listed options you can use an option budget I told you I was going to be valuable patents as a knowledge so you're a pharmaceutical company but a patent on a drug is that diabetes Drugs That's What emerged from the pattern if I take the present that is the expected cash flows I can get from developing the drug you know trade capacity rate the underlying answers doesn't mean I can't use an option card but I'm now in Dangerous Ground I can't replicate the portfolio in 500 applications foreign and um I think a lot of it for four or five years people died to teach auction price in these bathrooms but the natural water is built on mathematics that nobody in the finance class would have ever seen sarcastic countries something physical it might be paid all the time so after about four or five years of struggling to frustrated producing both here Mark Cuban says that there has to be an easier way to show people because we took as much as a where's the application you keep telling me there's your application I don't see it then 32. two-way two places right so let's take a very simple binomial model and I want to do this just to illustrate what replication I actually used so here's what you have you have a stock that right now trades during the day is talking about can go to either 70. or 35 if the stock goes to 70 a time period two can go to 150 logos to 35 can jump to 50 at one that t equal to 2 the stock can be 150 or 25s right now I'm going to continue with the call option strike prices and here's your debt I want you to create a replicating portfolio that has exactly the same cash flows at this call options all the way so let's see what you know you know where the stock price would be equal to Q equals one right now you have a call option with a life of two two time periods for the strike by itself but the only time you know what you can be involved and equal to at the end right because when the option expires so let's say the option is required remember you have the right to buy the shares and 40 dollars per share if it's darker than a hundred for the exercise here stock was 25 you take the right to put in the trash cans I wish I hadn't done that pretty fast moves here the girl standing I'm gonna call you pay for dealer so you know cash flows are going to be 60 10 until I quite fantastic I need to create a replicating photography which is that dashboard with six people saw price goes to 100 10 of the stock price goes to 50. and zero these stock price the only way to do this is to work back one time period so I'm going to go to t equal to one let's say the stock price of a hypothetical if the stock price goes to 17 what would I need to do to create a portfolio that will be with 16 to start with 100 or 10 this is the stock price goes to this how does able to create a replica borrow someone let's call that beat it's incredibly abstract we do that only an algebra you know how we do X and Wireless is your borrow B daughters and you buy T-shirts the stock is 70. so what's going to happen is stock price goes 100 tell me you're going to get a hundred times deep so that's the shift and you would have to pay back the B within let's say the interest rate of seven percent hundred times T minus the borrowing should be equal to 50 50 times B minus 1.11 still seven we have two equations and two unknowns if you work long enough and hard enough there should be no unknown right in this case I work long enough and not enough and I saw it with DNB b equal to one B is equal what does it even mean if the stock cost is that which cost me how much yeah how much out of my pocket did I have to come up with 70 minus 36 or 4 is 33.96 that is what it cost me to create the replica input phone into stock order for 70. guess what I'm going to charge requires the call option b1396 items solve for the value of the card option stock price goes to seven yeah what if it doesn't work seven well I repeat the process again we'll start with 250 I've been staying inside of the equation my equation here gives equal to 0.4 n be equal to 9.01 you know if it's not goes to thirty five dollars I'm going to go out and I'm sorry 35 I'm going to borrow three nine dollars and one cent and buy point four shares of stocks to my cat that position is going to cost me 4.99 the call has to be worth it for now so you see where I am now right I have the value of the call and equal to one now I can go to T equals this is why you have to work frequency you go back to t equal to zero what am I trying to do creating a replicating portfolio that'll have a value 33.96 so equals to 70 and 4.99 why because if I have those values I would be able to finance whatever I need to do so I don't have to come up with extra money so 70 times T minus 1.11 B is equal to 33 96 35 times D minus the dollar with interest is 4.99 solve for D and B I borrowed 21.61 I'm gonna buy that Delta shares of stock 0.8278 Channel stock that position cost me 19.42 today that's replication in process you guys on on there is able to see these slides are still stuck on the slides from the original page I'm going to assumed it cannot nobody's answering but any questions on what I'm trying to do you want to hear if you would step on data basically I'm trying to create a combination of borrowing and the underlying stock that is exactly the same cash goes to call by extension then I'm getting the value foreign [Music] so maybe if I make it admitted I might succeed because that problem pushing it let's make it a minute and let's have a three-month launch when you decide to use the binomial model divided the option what do you have to do break down three months into one minute they're very thought boggles my mind but let's say you want to go to Patient people you get a really sharp pencil a really big paper then you start drawing tiny little branches each one I'm in office if you're able to do it but let's say you can you dance right in the incredibly Advanced binomial let's split the paper it's like a Christmas tree without a base hang in there with me let's say you said that was too sharp under the ground out the edges so you round out the edges of the Christmas tree looks like a normal distribution welcome to what the binomial distribution occurred is made by saying it's really small and starting to become smaller that's called it continuous price distribution the black short distribution is a limiting case of the binomial it's time because according to this that the problem is the way the price moves in the black shows were is you get the thirty dollars to fifty dollars notice still for 30 30 or 1 30 or 30 or three there's no judging at us that's a limitation tomorrow it's going to affect the value to get out of it but it does give you this value what the advantage is a normal distribution remember all instead of branches you're putting numbers in now you have to give me an expected value that is the black shows came first by the binomial give you the intuition that leads so returning back in 1971 Bishops like a moment George foreign ers and they come back with the original black show now I'm going to list out that original model it had five drivers of an auction band the first is the stock price the second is the strike price the third is the life of the option the fourth is the risk in this industry and the fifth is for some of some reason Microsoft has decided to change all my sigmas from a Mac version two question marks I know that some didn't mentioned that it's sending me saying I'll come into using them back but that's any damage your question mark from this slide on it's the same way didn't I come up with six let's listen you originally pack shoulders dispense with you do you know what it's so much mathematical from deriving or close into leadership that they did what economists do when they have trouble but you've seen the problem with that they said let's assume the options are dividend protect give it a dividend protected offices look like you know the reason why it was an option is you're just living in this way to stop trying drugs in a dividend protected option your exercise strike will also be adjusted accordingly then I don't dividend protected option but somebody told me to present there so the original black throws model indicated another question marks and segments of I want to emphasize that the original Direction was the valuable call is s which is the value of the stock today what do they expect that that's n of B1 to come back and talk about what is n of B1 that magnitude minus K which is the exercise right e minus what do you think about yourself thing because that's not the way we try to complete present value right we take one plus raised to the party he said what is e minus RT remember we should talk about continuous type if you take present time you need to complete your style what is the power B so e minus R3 is a secret value why because remember you don't have to pay the exercise foreign [Music] [Music] here's what you do you go to a normal distribution in nfd1 and NLB you are areas under the distribution let me emphasize it again most statistics groups are normal distribution but they're not areas their height this actually can be there and it's a standardization okay so what if you look at the value for energy it can never be less than zero it cannot be greater than you know what I prefer to think of anything too as the problems government property started in less than zero higher than one of what that the option would be in the money back later on if it's in the regarding this session the next one I'm going to argue that energy was actually a draft estimate the liking that your option will be in the month it gives you a way of estimating the likelihood being right the replicated portfolio for this call is right there in the black children to replicate this phone here's what you need to do you need to borrow the present value with k e minus RT times and D2 that becomes and you buy nd1 share so that's called the option then if you do that if you create the replicating portfolk so I think the more you're useful you know application to lecture is not to get that output the call Value but to understand what that replicated portfolio almost everything an option pricing is burned rather than anything option Traders are offered in the form of degree as you notice it the auction debt has right there you know the option gamers in other words tell you what will happen to your number of shares right as the software it goes off and why do you care because you want the heads if you need to know what that is what's your option Theta is going to change and what's your option breaker then the deviation changes they love to add this layer week after that but it's always one simple replicating portfolio everything you do is about what it replicating so don't let people the University [Music] one final point which would like shows was designed to go ahead and dividend protected options and I can see that up right but in many of the real options examples we're going to talk about there will be differences there's a version of the black shown that's been developed or cut stock that actually paid evidence the thing of what happened here what's the replicated foreign so the first thing that you adjust is you have a different variable the second is if you expect yourself to pay a dividend in the future what should happen with the stock price over time remember every time the dividend gets paid the stock price drop so I want to reduce the values and stuff by the expected dividend yield over time so effectively damn thing it's not just going to get less value modern work so we do to save the dividend but it's a way in which you can bring dividends into the right show if you experimented number four we complete this section more than the challenges we face in the news often pressing Waters including real off into those compressing water is designed to values the same so what if I enlisted options things were you like wearing the option price right away if we joining either exercise or you can decide and with this dog which were always done with it super sad so with listed options almost known they're they're a few exceptions exercising support So if you buy stream and CBR option is 97 of people your options priority you might still be wondering what is going to be original batchel of the design that what are called European objects which means they design the value option you can get exercise only on that last step so for this adoption they were fun but what did they say about the passages uh option right but what are the excess value that all should be what do you think develop these factors so I think it's 17 years of life left he would have went to the 360 per day of the 17 years so in a real option you almost want it's really excited because that's the way you get that so one of the critiques of people using the black show and Slot is you usually if you're a pin off to pricing models to Value the instructor with options here if you want to take a shoot there are binomial warrants that are not really in the traditional binomial model can the laboratory Solutions you want to use a binomial model with a tanular options this one minute diving maybe one daytime think of how much information you need to do that and you can already see that I if I I'm going to use the black joke to Value these options in the nearby defense when you're using a European option pricing model very numerical option you're still getting a value but you're getting a diploma right because the option to exercise on you can only increase 20 30. if this is conservative some point in time you have a colleague and you feel the urge to pull the option pricing so architecture out of your kind of convince them to Launch before you do that there might be a simpler way in which you can bring home the oxide and down inside in order decision Tree website in decision three layer all the quantum outside and you can build in this app and you want to continue a decision tree is a much film the way to the value of the same conclusions you have with an auction pricing model without any of the black shoulders or varying you're actually pricing electric mechanics if your objectives intimidate your body go ahead and pressing order to talk about vague that's the thing that's that you have no idea what you're talking about you blow it right button but if your objective is trying to get them to do sensible things when you want to see the outside of the downside a decision tree Done Right will actually give you the same value as an option but it does require that we draw the entire decision you don't wonder what that even means I mean this is the decision tree I do for our diet meetings so you're right there so the way to read the decision tree is the boxes of Choice Sports Circles of proverb something happens they're out of their chance so right now you're here and deciding whether to test the drug or not and you have if you test this is 70 chance probabilities [Music] where they have a decision tree that the process called rolling bear sounds fancy but you didn't expect it for anything starting with the end levels and working your way back and if you get the expected value of this decision you come up with the value of 57. what does that even mean given all the uncertainty in all the possibilities can be expected value of this position to interactive you should get you know that because if you have the option pricing model arrive at the same 57 million but to a pharmaceutical companies imagine that this is much more intuitive to talk about stage one stage two save three properties outcomes because it connects the value of your phone that's what's driving the bad stuff so let's summarize somebody comes in with an optionality argument three questions to ask if is there an option should we even be talking about this at all okay is there exclusively their economic value third you know this is an option prices I'm going to say that person for every 100 mentions of options I get from people think well they are apparently maybe 20 make it through the first steps maybe five are significant so that's not too small environment among the five that have significant economic value maybe two can be values what I'm trying to say is don't praise and start using democracy pricing models on their companies justify paying their premiums they're the exception rather than the rule suddenly it started on options and products so let's go back to public Financial modeling project for all sort of opportunities you can be expected capitalization what based on what you know you estimate the discount rate based on again what you don't understand understand but wait you might not want to throw this project out and here are the three options I might remember first a project can be a bad project there but could it become a good product in the future I gave you the exclusive rights to a non-viable technology or advancing don't exclusive rights can still be valued but think about it if I came to you with a non-viable AI technology plan because the fact that it's non-viable today doesn't mean it couldn't but you need that exclusive so that's the option here's the second one now things are going to get really repaired you're entering into a project where you go to that president you know why you're doing it because if you enter the project and things work hard sometimes you might get outcome you're better than expected you will get the right to take a another bigger project right now based on what you know about the makeup project it's going to be a terrible project right now please Point them back to work right I'm giving you a bad project which gives you the right to an even worse stuff okay why would I do that because the second product is still your choice if that second project is a huge Market you see how you like to be able to take the negative method and run project and justify it by saying hey there is that's the option to expect it's often the option that's used for people entering very big markets even though they know they're going to make money on admission and thirdly there's the option for that the option available product so you can negative cash flow nice to create yourself away don't you always have the right not necessary You better lock yourself in perfect to your company to be a long-term contract the option to delay you have to expand the options of that each of these options is value and sometimes they can overwhelm the negative Network value that's what I learned by opening the door you're now overriding a core of corporate Financial don't pay product of that negative net personal value but you deal with these countries so let's start with the option yeah because that's every computer traditional Capital budgeting enhances you know you get the cash flows in this contract you're getting a net present value of thinking this product today and you're concluding this project is good or bad it is having the exclusive writing project for the next five or ten years though can change how you think about the project what because even though the net present value is negative yeah at some point in time in the future technological change a lot of things will change what that promises you're talking about the options lay across what's the other man answered right you're not taking the processes the right to the project right now they're not but who knows do we have to know three years from now whatever what's the most you can lose whatever you paid outside together diagram I'm going to use this option to delete talk about too many real world options today that will be running the first of the matter what is the plan to do it gives you exclusive rights to develop whatever you patented into a conversion part keyword is right you're not force the developer better you have the right to develop so that's a very abstract example let's suppose that the investment you need today convert the patent or commercial product is up I'm not being particularly creative I quickly that let's suppose the present value of cash flows from developing this pattern today's video so today I think it's less than that what do you decide don't development but you have to plan for the next day if at some point in time we exceeds are you're in the money foreign foreign if not what happened you lose whatever you think are those in the two ways companies end up with them what is developed by doing what you are already because the cost to pay to actually buy off so that's one way to reframe r d r d not have a traditional Cafe you're investing in acquiring confidence many of them are out of the money that option will never pay off but some might be worth the money but whatever you pay for some of the cost so I always wanted to try this online because I've seen it in textbooks and almost every textbook that makes up an example somebody else in the real pattern and this is a framework you're going to see me use almost every real large let me program you need skrt and signal he worked out with the S here it's about in the underlying act which is if I develop the patterns today what will I get pregnant category so let's say your mind is I think the big terms I can't do numbers I said you know what I wanted estimate expected casualties converting this plan to be right now if you complain to these will be right yeah you see why it said is actually going to work in their favor so you know wrap your hands around the uncertainty make your best estimate to the expected cash flows compute the present back so it's like any answers give me the president that's when it becomes the value of the underlying land it will be noise but that's a second stop I'm going to ask you what's it very easy you would run over to the Bloomberg terminal type in the name of the package and you're going to come back and tell me what trying to find it why not it's not traded and this is where a lot of people just give up I can't get it there I'm going to give you two ways of getting the variance one is an easy and a lazy way and I use it all the time which is look at variants of publicly traded stocks in that space the biotechnology project look at this energy is being driven by the uncertainty the other is a little more work but I think it's actually more meaningful remember simulation you get well you get a distribution you get a standard deviation in fact you take this project you're complaining about the answer and be better than certain age do a Monte Carlo simulation you can understand the deviation that becomes a sigma that I will use what's the life of this option and here's one final catch what did he say about illustrial options but the people don't exercise all of that I need to put a trigger here otherwise you know what's going to happen is what is that that will never get developed I have to create a cost of waiting once this project becomes by so let's say it's two years in that's the fact that we combine part of me says let's wait in the one specific more information learn more about the market like the Quran good what's the cost of way to get experience what do you give up when your protection that's not the participation only give up one year of rejection I'm going to use a very simplistic measure of what I lose by taking 1 over X about 70 years left I'm renting 117th but the value is large because I don't need to do it what's going to happen with across the layers and put it from 1 16 then one should be recorded level down depending the fire going because I want to push you to exercise at some point yeah otherwise you keep putting it off and putting it off so here's the option the pattern that I would expect it's a drug called abenence that was developed in the 1990 and I got incredibly lucky there because I was able to get my hands in the cash flow estimates made by buyers of companies and all the animals have you ever seen cash flow as students that functional government for drugs and it's scary outside that's what they do they start with the percentage of the population you can deliver around us if they look at the percentage of those people who actually don't see a dog it's not 100 then they take the percentage of people actually going to see a dog to get the right diagnosis [Music] Ms and end up with 1.8 million people and then you go through a very moral exercise pricing for the drug revenues of cash flows foreign [Music] to set up the infrastructure minus initial investment is that personality medicinal Gap if I this one capital budget which I have done right that person that is 547 billion has been done let's move on not so fast so the value of this drive for business yeah basically 547 days and this is a lot of uncertainty this business Theory which means that that value they waited six months or a girl could get much higher it could get much lower it's a viable brother but by waiting they accumulated information but side effects drugs the part you can almost see a management TV I says it's way you know we learn more about the drug we can develop a better drugs and the other one is there's a cost away and they're going to tell if you wait that 17 years is going to become 16 years you've given up one out of 70 years that's my cause of the net plug the numbers in B1 B2 energy I get a value for the qualities this is like to match my Net Present Value is 547 million my DCF values 547 million I have a 360 million dollar premium on top of that brand what as your optionality but the coming from technical competition but if you're an MS stuff it's an incredibly bad news right if you're the company now you're too bad by 47 minutes left to work out if you do what you go out and Investments the option value 907 is rated at 547 so it is let's wait why because the time premium and the option actually exceeds the cost to delay until it gets it before I leave you with that very negative ending to the story I have to tell you what the truth for evidence actually develop the drug about stimulus is rather than eight years what do you think lessons and it turned out that Merck and Pfizer were working on their own Ms drugs [Music] here's the bottom line if you're in a competitive pharmaceutical business well multiple companies are working on drugs for the same the option that is very pushy stuff is foreign that's what if you're planning average in the DCF more let's say you were in my spreadsheet to that and I keep entering the numbers in I think anyway some of the Blockbuster drug feed address how would the traditional DCF models because a higher Revenue growth and higher mode so in the traditional DCF we do this but we don't explicitly deal with it as an option here is it the alternative approach you're actually trying to break it so don't add this putting your words off of a traditional DCF value that we double counted right because tradition PCM you've already given them credit for have an XP you know a product that you increase their product you can't add the option right so the case about it is in two existing words I totally didn't produce either of these they didn't sell either these drugs directly they licensed about and they license them out to two native Farms to get their names and the license fees they were getting there are two ways you can structure a license you can make it a percent in the revenues or you can get a basically in other words the contracts I didn't make 50 million guarantees sometimes I would like to just take the present value for 50 minutes this conversation don't be so quick to pull the cross to capitalize what's your risk you will not get these cash flows that work or after not quite zero worker option at guarantee the casual but they go back to accept that right the cost of death of those companies that are used at my discount office what if I told you that Biogen had licensed out these two products to the U.S government and the US government has guaranteed 50 million degrees don't be so quick to put the cost that can happen if you've discuss it I know that partly the way you get you know hardwired through school is all these things people have happened don't be so quickly put it down to this country one final Point there's one final twice the value that I haven't brought in which is an existing r d Department that is so when you start right after the quiz I want to value that that r d Department as somebody Mr wood drivers and destroyed with nothing and that's going to continue so I was singing on Wednesdays I actually use the standard deviation of individual stocks and 50 habits 
foreign okay folks please sit down so as as with the other two quizzes as with the other two quizzes I'll let you know when the quizzes are done you can come pick them up okay come sit you're going to say if you're going to stay in class sit down please nothing right now after the classroom is it about the quiz it'd be a half a point of a suggestion out there okay okay okay so not a session last session I was talking about valuing patterns as options right so somebody explained to me again what the rationale is what is it about a pet that makes it an option a fox if you want to leave go ahead and leave the room and you can just have your discussions outside class is on right now okay so what is it about a patent that makes it an option dookie it's the fact that you have an exclusive right don't forget the word exclusive any time there's an option discussion the word exclusive has to come into play okay and in the case of Biogen having X has a lot of value as an option but it also has two existing products that produce cash flows they're licensed and the point I try to make is when you discount cash flows the risk you should be looking at in the discard rate should be the risk in the cash flows so if guaranteed cash flows what's your only risk you face that the people guaranteed you those cash flows might default that's why I use the cost of debt of the guarantors which brings me to the third and final leg of alibiotin so the validate existing products have the value of app and X as a patent let's talk about the value of r d as a continuing part of the company so first what does r d create so when you have a department there are expenses right their costs in this case let's assume that those costs were 100 million last year and you expect them to grow 20 percent a year for the next 10 years so that's it that's a bad sign that's how much you're going to spend that r d you hope and pray will create value what does that mean that whatever you spend you get back plus more maybe we talked about return on Capital and costly Capital if your r d earns exactly its cost to Capital every dollar you spend an r d you get back a dollar there'll be no value create in this case I'm going to assume that Biogen creates about a dollar 25 in value for every dollar and invest that works out to about a three percent excess return you're earning over the cost Capital that's what they've done historically so I'm going to assume that they can continue to earn that three percent exercise at the end of 10 years what happens r d becomes a neutral business you own your cost of capital so the value r d here's what I'm going to do I'm going to first project up the r d expense each year so that's the cost I'm going to multiply the cost by a dollar 25 that gives me my expected value I have no idea whether I will deliver it but that's my expected value the difference between those two is the value created by r d on an expected basis each year am I uncertain about it boy am I uncertain about it so I use much higher discount rate for this of 15 to Discount those excess value back you take the present value of that excess value created come up with 380 million dollars I've got all three slices of Biogen ready to go my existing business existing two products the cash flows I get from at what 397 million as an option is worth 907 million r d continuing is what 318 million so if I assume r d earns its cost of capital it's effect completely goes away I can just focus on what are the existing products what patents do you have you add those three numbers up you get the equivalent of what you get in your discount free cash on the firm at the cost of capital in a traditional DCF there you try to bring in the avanex effect into expected growth here I'm bringing it in separately what I'm trying to say is don't double count if you value Biogen with a high growth rate and the argument for the high growth rate is it has evidence it's going to develop it you can't add the value of ab and X on top of that because that'll be double covered so let's bring it all together remember those three questions I said we need to ask about any real option is there an option embedded in patterns absolutely the the underlying acid is the drug that or product that comes out of the patent the contingencies you will develop it only if the present value the cash flows exceed the cost and there is a life to the option so it clearly meets an option requirement is there exclusivity what's the answer to that yes and maybe why yes and maybe yes because you get protection against competition from somebody else producing exactly the same product the product but it doesn't give you protection from other companies producing their own drugs to treat Ms sub you know so if you live in an intensely competitive market your exclusivity can very quickly start to fade away can I use an option pricing model I'm really stretching right what do you need for an option pricing model you need to be able to trade the underlying asset create the option do replication there is zero chance of me trading the underlying asset here it's a drug emerging from a from a fat there's zero chance of me trading the patent it's not a tradable instrument I'm pushing the limits of option pricing models when I plug it into the Black Shoals come up with the value doesn't stop me from coming up the value but if you push me and say would you be willing to pay 907 million dollars for evidence as a patent I'm probably going to pull back because I'll give you 650 maybe 700 but I'm not comfortable fully monetizing it because option pricing models require replication Arbitrage any questions on patents as options so the option to delay something non-viable becomes viable you develop it you make money it could of course never become viable in which case you lose what you paid to get the pattern let's take a second example of an option to delay you have an oil company the oil company is develop results it produces oil sells it gets cash flows you discount the cash flows traditional asset right but it is undeveloped as preserves it can choose to develop them or choose not to it has the right to develop those results and what drives whether they do or not what's a factor that will determine whether they develop those results but the oil prices go up another oil prices stay at 25 you're just going to sit on those reserves it's driven almost entirely by the oil press You could argue that undeveloped reserves for any natural resource company are options and in fact if you ask me to draw the payoff diagram here's what it's going to look like the cost of developing the reserve is going to become the equivalent of the strike price you will do it only if the value of the oil under the ground exceeds that cost and if that never happens what do you lose how do you get those results in the first place you either did exploration or you bid at auctions for them whatever you paid for it is now gone that's a call option so if you force me to value and undeveloped reserves as a call option and I'm going to put the numbers I want you to compare whether this is more or less difficult than valuing a patent first step I need to estimate the value of the oil under the ground if I develop today but how long companies know how much oil is under the ground they're like geologists they hire they tap the ground and they come back and say 80 million barrels I have no idea what they did but it turns out that that track record is better than equity research items so we shouldn't laugh at them but they come back and they say there's so much oil under the ground and then to convert the barrels of oil into cash flows I multiply by an oil price and again I'm not playing all price forecaster but I can take the forward prices of oil compute the expected cash flows take the present value that's going to become the s in the morning get traditional DCF what's the exercise price the cost of actually developing the result what is that cost going to be well it depends on what part of the world you're getting the oil out of the ground from if it's in Saudi Arabia the cost might be minimum because the oil is six inches under the ground if it's in Canada it could be immense because it might be 5000 feet under the ground and frozen in ice but you most all companies know depending on the part of the world what to cost to actually develop the result that becomes a strike price and here's where this option is going to get easier than the pattern the pattern remember when I talked about variance in value we had to do this little dance of let's run simulations what's the thing you that that's driving the variance here oil prices right I don't have to do any simulations it's a traded instrument I can look at the variants in oil prices that becomes the variance I use in the March I've got s I've got K I've got Sigma whatever life I attach to the option but what's the life of this option how long do I get a reserve for so I get the rights to develop Reserve is it in perpetuity used to be at one point in time all companies get reserved and they say now you actually bid at an auction so the U.S government might open Arctic reserves for exploration you bet you get it right for 20 years 25 years at the end of which it reverts back to the government that becomes the life of the option but remember we said with real options we need something that forces exercise otherwise everybody will just sit on the reserves there has to be a cost of delay once this Reserve becomes viable something to trigger you to develop in other words there's got to be a cost once something the reserve becomes viable I've said this is what I lose by waiting an extra year because part of you is always going to wait right oil pressure could go up even further the cash flows you get from developing the reserve on an annual basis become the equivalent of that cost of delay it's a dividend year in that black Schultz model that becomes the trigger there's one final component to natural resource options that has to be brought into play so let's say you work at Exxon Mobil oil prices go to 150 dollars a barrel you decide to develop big chunk of your results so you pick up the phone and that's the way you do it or maybe you're in a more updated way of doing it cause it get those reserves going you get oil out of the ground the next day takes a while right there's a development lag between the time you decide and will that reduce or increase the value of these reserves as options that you have to wait a couple of years before oil comes out of the ground Dean and tell me why one is a pure present value the other is this is why did you choose to develop Reserve because oil prices got to 150. if you need to wait for two years for the oil to come out of the ground you think maybe oil press would be back to sixty dollars before that happens on both dimensions you worry about that's a development lab so let's apply this on an oil company let's see if we can devalue the undeveloped preserves in Oil Company using this approach the company I'm going to Target it's a company called Gulf oil Major Oil Company in the 1980s and I'll tell you why I had to go all the way back to the 1980s to pick a company to Value using this approach it was targeted in a hostile acquisition precisely because there are lots of Reserves how much did it have 3.038 billion barrels of results under the ground it was estimated would cost about ten dollars per barrel to develop those results in other words to be an upfront cost of 30.38 billion if they choose to develop their results it's a lot of money oil prices then were 22.38 cents a barrel the variable cost was seven dollars so every barrel of oil they get out of the ground they make 15.38 to think of three billion barrels of oil you make 15.38 there is a lag if you decided available to take about two years before the oil actually comes out of the ground but here's the fact that that's going to give the option added the oil prices which are at 22.38 per barrel right now could change how much the variance in oil prices that you can observe by looking at trade it all over the last few years is 0.03 which means the oil price could go higher it could go lower that's going to drive the value of the option if you choose to develop the reserve the cash flows you will get each year will be about five percent of the value they are so that's what you give up by not developing the roof that's going to become the cost to delay we have all the pieces we need let's go through the process of trying to Value this Reserve as an option first step I need to estimate what the value of this Reserve is if I took all if I decide to develop it today right 3038 million barrels now normally this would require projecting out how many barrels of oil you get every year take the expected price take the present value I'm going to take a shortcut I'm going to take the 3038 million barrels multiply by 1538 that's what I make per barrel and because I have to wait two years I don't get the first two years of cash flows I'm going to take out the effect of the first years looks like this Karthik but I'm taking out the first two years of cash flow what I get is the present value of the oil under the ground is 42.38 it'll cost me 30.38 billion to develop these results if I stopped right there and ask you for a DCF value for these Reserves all you need to do is subtract the 30.38 from the 42.38 that gives you a 12 billion dollar intrinsic value or a DCF value for themselves and that's where we would stop prior to the real options argument but remember they haven't developed the reserve yet they have 12 more years to do it because each year their weight they give up the cash flows of five percent so that becomes a cost to delay and oil prices to move 0.03 if you plug those numbers in and using the option pricing model you get something magical the value that you get for these reserves valued as options is 13.3 billion dollars someone pause right there this seems almost magical I took a DCF value of 12 billion for the reserves is everybody clear where I got the 12 billion is this the 42.38 minus the 30.38 that is my TCF value I'm now arguing that these reserves are worth 13.3 billion where's the extra 1.3 billion dollars in value coming from in the option pricing model where's the extra 1.3 value it's coming from the fact that I'm not in the property increase that oil prices are wallet right if I made the variance of oil prices zero what will happen to the value of this preserve as an option it will go to 12 value you'll basically go to my DCF ad if I made the variance 0.06 I doubled it it'll increase the value of the option from 1.3 billion to two and a half billion do you see what the implication of this is right when we think about valuing oil companies we know the level of oil prices matters higher prices translate to higher value what option pricing models tell you it's not just the level of oil price that matters but how volatile those prices are here's your best case scenario for value for an oil company you want oil prices to be high and wallet what's your worst case scenario low and boring what happened the 1980s and 90s oil prices went to 25 and hardly moved I wondered why there was even a market always 25 dollars a back worst case scenario for all so when you think about oil companies think about them as a mix of traditional DCF or oil they're producing and the option of undeveloped reserves and that proportion varies across oil companies and Exxon Mobil or Royal Dutch gets 85 percent of its value from the form of 15 from the lab a petrobras gets about 30 percent of its value from the first and 70 from the latter so more petrobras's value is driven by the optionality because more of its reserves are undeveloped any questions yes that's a good it's a quite what I'm also not factoring in is there's an inflation factor that will affect the prices so I'm kind of hoping they kind of offset that's why I said if I to do this right what I have to do is take the third the the the 3.038 billion barrels that you know produce based on capacity say 150 million barrels every year for the next 20 years get an expected oil price a discount back at cost of capital I've got to cut through all those steps because that would be the way I would get the s in the model in the first place so now let's bring them both together in Pavilion gold foil you have developed preserves and undeveloped reserves we value the undeveloped Reserves at 13.3 bill so what about the developed reserves those are not options they develop oil is going to come out of the ground I take the present value of the cash flow of 915 million every year for the next 10 years so what happens after year 10 there's nothing left once the reserves are gone there's no terminal value no savage value present value of 950 million dollars every year for the next 10 years added 12 and a half percent cost to Capital gives me a value of 5.07 penny so add the two numbers up you got the value of another company would I do this for a Royal Dutch not really it doesn't make sense but if you gave me a small oil company that's getting the bulk of its value from undeveloped Reserves or a small gold mining company or any kind of natural resource company you're going to see this player so let's put on natural resource companies let's pass it through the test is there an option in undeveloped research no oil under the ground what's the contingency the value of the oil exceeds a cost developing you'll develop okay that happens is there exclusivity or if there is exclusivity where is it coming from for an oil company they show where is the exclusively coming from that and the fact there's only so much oil under the ground right so it's a it's a natural resource that exclusivity is going to give it value but as with Pharmaceuticals what do we use oil for we don't drink it I don't think so we use it for energy and to the degree that alternative energy sources can provide that energy the op the optionality is going to start to get you know we're seeing that fossil fuels are actually a lot more resilient than we thought they were right they're not going away anywhere they still seem to hold their own but that's what you're worried about can we apply an option pricing model this is about as close to being able to do it as we're going to get right what is the underlying as the oil under the ground can you trade oil absolutely can you trade reserves all companies do it all the time they buy and sell Reserves you can actually do replication Arbitrage with real options and that's why real options have their deepest roots in natural resource companies or oil companies have been using them for 30 35 40 years to decide how much value to tax reserves that's why all companies don't give away non-viables of saying we don't need them you could take them they treat them as options they're options even non-viable reserves are valued because oil prices evolved in fact staying on that theme of scarce of scarcity driving exclusivity now when let's say you buy a building in New York City four-story building East Village you know what price you pay for it there's a value for the building right you can value it based on rental income and come up with the value every New York City building that value is going to have an option premium on it why could land in Manhattan is scarce why because it's an island don't do this in Kansas City it's not going to end well for you because all they're going to do is keep building out in every direction there's nothing to stop you if you ever flown into Vegas you know exactly what happens right it just sprawls up La the same way but Manhattan has this Advantage off of one side you have the Hudson River the other side here you know the East River and basically you you're stuck with the land and in Manhattan there's one other thing that drives the optionality every square foot of Manhattan has been spoken for it's been spoken for in what sense there are regulations on what you can build on that land how much square footage you can put so if you have a building of less than that maximum square footage You could argue that they have the optionality to increase the size of the building would you do it maybe not now but you could there's an option bad in contrast if you have another building that's already at full capacity there's going to be much less optionality in that building so something in real estate that you don't think about as an option but does come into play when people decide how much to pay so now let's talk about a second kind of option the option to expand and this is where things can get really hairy because you're now starting to break rules and finances you're not supposed to break I come to you with a project and I'm open about the fact that it's a negative Net Present Value it's bad project but I say you know what wait before you reject the project I have to tell you that if you take this project even though it is a negative Net Present Value it gives you the rights to a second project that second project let's call it the project to expect and you ask me well how good is that project right now it looks bad so basically you've got a bad project that gives you a ride to another really bad project think why would I do it it's the second project is an option it's an option where you can choose to expand or not expand and if you think about what you what you're looking at here it's the underlying project the present value of the cash flows in that project become the equivalent of the underlying asset the investment you need to make to expand becomes the equivalent of the strike price you will expand only if the present value the cash flows exceeds that investment and if not what do you lose what is this price you pay for this option you took the first project right which had a negative Net Present Value that becomes the cost of the option I know it sounds incredibly abstract but here's a very simple way to see why it can make a big difference in your DCF valuation I'm going to take an example here it's a it's a completely made up example but I'll use it to draw some implications for why investors need to get I come to you with a virus software equipment got a history it's got margins Revenue growth you plug in the numbers growth margins reinvestment pre-cash flow you discounted cash flow you come up with 115 million as your TCF app you're done right say but wait this antivirus company as it's selling its products also collecting data from its customs that data can be used to create potentially a database business in the future how long in the future anytime over the next five years so you asked me well how lucrative is that business I'll tell you and you're not going to like it it'll cost you about a half a billion dollars to get into that business today and the cash flows you can get are about 40 million and after tax terms every year for 10 years you don't even need to do any present value to know that this looks like a bad investment right half a billion up front you get 40 million for 10 years even before discounting it's negative in but if you discounted 12 it's going to get even worse you're saying why would I even think about this database business you have five years to make this choice of whether to expand the standard deviation in database businesses is 50 it's a very very very volatile business and that's what's going to drive the value of the option the risk-free rate is three percent so I plug the numbers in as I said the numbers don't look pretty the present value 40 million for 10 years at 12 is 226 million it costs you a half a billion to enter the business what's the net present value minus 279 million right five years 50 standard deviation the magical the option to enter a business where the cost is two and a half times what you can make as value is 56 million dollars so if you're paying for this business you'd pay 115 million plus the 56 million and 56 million is coming from that option honey sounds incredibly abstract but I'll tell you an example of how this plays out in practice remember when Facebook got hit with the Cambridge analytica scandal it made the stock price drop 2017. this was a soaring company company had never seen a real downturn since it's in three months into its IPO had only seen up up up and it dropped it dropped I think 133 dollars per share I valued at that time the blog posted somewhere out there you could check it out I came up with the value of 135 dollars per share fairly undervalued right now what's the rule in reinvesting you need a margin of safety to invest and briskier companies you need an even bigger margin of safety because of riskier I'm going to contest that notion I bought Facebook at 133 and the pushback are you crazy you just found it one percent undervalued it's a risky company and I said I'm glad it's a risky company and here's what I value Facebook as an online advertising company so all of my revenues my total Market was the online advertising Market the cash flows are online advertising cash flows and the 135 dollars is the value of Facebook as an online advertising company what what's on its platform three billion users right right now all you're selling them is online advertising you haven't figured out what to do next or you haven't don't want to do it right now but this clearly optionality retail products Entertainment News whatever I'm not going to try to Value it as an option too messy too many inputs to get but essentially it means the 135 I get is a Bare Bones absolute flow value that that's going to be on top of the 135. in now in investing people talk about rights queue basically this positive huge payoffs that's what it shows up it's Facebook there's a chance it's a small chance that you could get these huge payouts I'm willing to buy Facebook when it's two percent under bad in contrast Coca-Cola needs to be 10 or 15 undervalued and here's why you know there's no optionality in Coca-Cola what are they going to come up with I don't want to think about it but a drink that makes you thinner as you drink more and more of it maybe they will but there is really not much optionality in companies where the product base is kind of and this is what makes platform companies interested because let's face it because the smaller platform company Zoom Peloton Uber Lyft have all had a really tough 18 months You could argue that you're now getting these companies at their Core Business value or perhaps a little more and so you might even be paying a little more than that Core Business back but these are still immense platforms there are 123 million people on The Uber platform You could argue that maybe maybe if they can find a way you think that's stretching of course it's stretching that's what optionality is all about that maybe they're 120 so this is at the core of why people like platform companies but what's a key question you got to ask as you collect data about about people is it exclusive I'm not sure what Uber what data Uber collects on me but it's not as as exclusive as a data Facebook collects on its users I don't know what user data Peloton keeps on its subscribers but my guess is they know a great deal about your exercise habits more than you probably want them to know so while you go around telling people I exercise 40 minutes a day you know you were standing on that treadmill this morning for 27 minutes reading something I can tell right here okay but there is a degree so the more exclusive the data they collect on the people in the platform the more option value there is to that platform so as you look at this this argument for for so essentially you can see it's a dangerous argument right because I'm asking you to buy something and pay a premium something that might happen in the future is it so focus in then on when the option has the most bad it has the most value and you and only you can do this that's exclusivity it has very little value and everybody can do it I remember when lime and bike the line bikes came out remember that you could rent the bike and ride them all over town and then dump them wherever you wanted the argument that was made by one of the VCS is platform argument they didn't use the word option but they said we have a platform which effectively we'll think of something to do with all this data we're collecting the only promise the only data that a line collects on you is where you got on the bike and where you got off the bike it's location information and location information I mean I I remember when this came out I pulled out my iPhone and I tracked how many apps knew where I was the apps do more about where I was and where than I myself knew so if I wanted where am I I'd look at the apps okay you're here okay I get it now this is not exclusive information of all the information you're collecting so not all platforms have equal value but some have a significant amount of value because of that exclusive so is there an option yes the option is built around that second project to expand is there exclusively here it's all over the place right you've got to look at each option to expand separately and it might be huge in some cases where you're the only player in town and much much smaller in other cases and here again we're stretching with an option pricing model the reason I'm trying to Value the option at Facebook so I could make up numbers put an S in okay but nothing is replicable here I can't trade the underlying asset I can trade the option it's kind of an exercise in tutoring so all I can say it's large as a number but I don't know how big and that's why I would not do this as a justification if I'm buying Facebook it twice my estimated value then I'm asking for trouble but to the extent that I'm getting it close to estimated value anything that happens the option is icing on the cake so look take a look at your DCF some of you have DCFS that are very close to the price you're wondering is that no is that difference in fact a few of you have email is saying is that Gap large enough that I can buy which my response is still your choice I can't tell you you have to decide but one thing that might break the tie there is if your account if you're looking at a company like Facebook you might argue that if it's close to value that it's effectively a buy because you got that extra option on top or whatever you're doing any questions on the option to expect talk about the option to abandon the option to abandon is the only real option that's a put option and here's how it works you make an investment it's in a long-term project and the investment doesn't look like it's working it's nice to be able to walk away abandon the investment and get back you know let's say you can get back only half your original investment you're going to regret what you did but I've given you a floor on how much you can lose so what you get when your abandoned becomes a strike price and you will abandon when the present value of the cash flows become smaller than that's right because let's use an example to illustrate let's suppose you work at Airbus and I work at Leo record Airbus of course makes commercial aircraft for around the world it competes with Boeing Leo produces corporate Jets let's say I'm interested as clear in entering the commercial jet Market so I come to you with the joint venture proposal I said look let's start a joint venture we put up 50 you put up 50 that 50 will translate into a half a billion dollars as Airbus you decide to work through the numbers of this joint venture and based on your estimates let's say you come up with the present value of the cash flows of 480 million so you have to invest 500 million you get back 480 million that's a net present value of minus 20 million so you come back to me and say no we're not interested but I really really really want you to be a joint Patcher partner to offer you a sweetener I said look if you become a joint venture partner anytime over the next five years if you change your mind I will buy your 50 back at 400 ml less than you pay but what have I done I've limited how much you can lose to a to a hundred million you can't lose more than 100. I've given you an option to abandon how valuable is the option it depends on how certain or uncertain the cash flows in the project are the cash flows the project is certain this option is useless but at the degree that that cash flow can become higher or lower there is uncertainty I run a stimulation into the variance in the cash flow from this partnership is 0.16 I'm going to try to Value this option to abandon what's the number I'm going to compare that value to your net present value is minus 20 million I'm giving you this option I want this option to be worth at least 20 million for you to become a partner so here's what the numbers look like the S becomes the 480 Milli present value the cash flows today the K becomes what you will get if you walk away from this field which is pointed with is this an in the money option or out of the money option if it were to recall it would be in the money but this is a put right you get the right to sell at 400 it's an out of the money option the 0.16 is the variance in the cash flows you have five years to make your judgment and remember it's a finite life project so every year you wait you lose one year of cash flow so the project also being a 29 28 27 so each year it's going to become less not because of anything to do with the project but just fewer years of cash flows I plug the numbers in and I get a value for the put option of 73.23 million what does that mean remember your net present value is minus 20 million that's why you are reluctant to become a joint venture partner I've now offered you an option to abandon which is worth 73 million you add the two numbers up that basically means you're more likely doesn't guarantee it because I can't force you to become a joint venture partner you can now see why when joint venture negotiations one of the sweeteners that gets thrown in to attract people you want into the joint venture is these options to be able to walk away so in general though the option to walk away is what what I think about when people use the word flexibility that you want to be flexible as a company be able to adapt so if you think if you take that option to abandon it actually is part of a larger story of how valuable is it to be flexible yes you know why I didn't give you the option to abandon for 30 years you know what you do as an Airbus then right even if it's a good project what's going to happen to the value of this project as you go you know one year two remember as you go to your seven there's only 23 uh make it to your 29 how many years of cash flows are there left one more year so you know what you're going to do you're going to collect all the cash flows or the project is good on the 364th day of the 30th year you're going to show up and say I never liked this project I would like my 400 million dollars back so that's why I had to cut the abandonment option off much earlier than the project ends because otherwise you wait till the very last moment collect 400 million dollars and get the cash flows in the project so it's deliberate that I've left you the option abandoned only to the early years and not for the life of the project see you don't care right because in a sense you get the option for the next five years you get the present value the cash flow so if the project starts to look bad you just essentially abandon at that point in time and leave the other joint bench apartment than after dealing with the failure that's exactly why you want the option to abandon is you want to be able to walk away in case you think the project might crash that's a present value but let's remember the that's based on the expected cash flows today let's say one year in you're not selling as many commercial aircraft as you you revisit that present value probably three six that's the variance I'm Computing in the cash flows is things may change the business so it means that when you're a company especially if you're a company that has a lot of long-term projects some of the things you're taught to do might not be the right thing to do for instance you're told enter into long-term contracts lock in your costs make them unpredictable that's good right but it also means you're less flexible your labor union comes in and offers you a 30-year contract you know you might negotiate but try to negotiate more flexibility where if things don't work out you can lay off people because otherwise you're stuck with those employees for the next 30 Years building and flexibility is really building an optionality and it's part of a larger discussion you can have about hey what's the value of flexibility and how do you build it into processing incidentally one of the things that Goldman used to have the reputation for was optionality what that means is when things were you know went better than expected they found ways to augment it and when things were going worse than expected they always seemed to find a way to whistle out before everybody else discovered maybe having one of you as the head of the senator of the treasury might help no but whatever it is they had that reputation it's gone now but there was a point in time when Goldman traded at a premium over other investment Banks precisely because of a viewed as more more flexible and I always thought of it as call option the upside input options on the downside that effectively means you become a more valuable company over time so let's stop that when we start on Monday we're going to start with the last part of real options and then we'll talk about Acquisitions and value enhancements yeah expenses because I I was sitting there questioning it is foreign thank you questions about myself University District is um it's not not it was actually development is very much larger yeah right it's all because I don't want to make their assumptions so I'll take the uh how exactly you start with for example yeah yeah it's a much lower payout ratio then I I use the same formula relative thinking uh foreign no no it went down to 125 years okay 
foreign thank you later thank you okay folks the clock is ticking right so somebody remind me getting a show what to do next Monday the project is due by 5 PM next Monday right so if you haven't picked a company yet got a lot of work to do now but hopefully you've all picked the company who passed the angst of doing a discounted cash flow evaluation here at the pricing part yeah money losing company the only advice I have for you is one of those Young Money losing companies don't take today's numbers plug them into regressions because you're going to get predictable values like what you put negative margins negative accounting returns which is what they have right now into an EV to sales regression you're going to get perhaps a negative EB to sales ratio so with those companies my only suggestion is go forward take your own DCF the numbers are all there right you got predicted margins in your 10 predicted revenues and you have 10 predicted return on Capital in year 10 use forward numbers it'll get you over the hump of getting a predicted value yes [Music] like what do you you mean I mean it says what format yeah basically I'll set up just like you know just like the DCF I'll set up subject matter and you will just email it to that particular mailbox it's critical especially this these last three weeks that you follow the subject matter because otherwise projects will be all over the place I don't want you submitting them on brightspace it's a pain in the neck for me to download stuff and put it on but piece of advice no Excel spreadsheets nothing needed in the final project all you need is your report with your companies your value pricing recommendation options if applicable for your company and as a PDF file one file for the entire group one person the group gets picked to submit so I don't get four of you in the same group submitting the same report four times so coordinate among yourselves as to who's going to do it my guess it'll happen sometime on Saturday or Sunday for most of you are being realistic for some of you it might be Monday at 4 58 now whatever it is you know find out whatever is it have some plans in advance now to do it So today we're going to complete our discussion of real options and I want to talk about two things two applications we haven't talked about one is to Value Financial flexibility as an option let's back up okay you've all taken a corporate finance class at I think it's called Corporate Finance the undergraduates as well now right you know the opto how do you come up with an optimal debt ratio for a company what is the optimal debt ratio of the company how do we Define that okay what makes it automatically decreases the whack and minimizes it minimizes the work so optimal debt ratio is the one that yields the lowest work so when a company is undelivered it has too little debt it has a cost to Capital higher than the option that's bad right but let's say the company pushes back and says look I want to preserve that excess debt capacity just in case a project of a lifetime comes along that's an options argument they're saying we're willing to give up a caustic Apple that's 30 basis points higher because the benefits we get from this flexibility more than 30 30 basis points per year I'm going to give you a way of computing that number but more important than the number itself is the implication that come out of it so I'm going to take a company and think of financial flexibility as an option here's how it plays out by preserving that excess debt capacity by borrowing less than I can what do I get I get the capacity to borrow that money and take this once in a lifetime project when it comes along so the payoff comes from the fact that I take a project with this huge Net Present Value because I have access to capacity so think of that as the upset what's the downside that project never comes along in which case you end up with this higher cost recap than you needed to you have nothing to show for I told it's a difficult option to Value but I'm going to try anyway so here's how I'm going to approach it I'm going to take an example one of the companies I used in my corporate finance class and I've used for five editions now is Disney so I do everything with Disney that I you know as I go through the class it becomes my lab experiment this is from my 1997 Edition the very first edition of the book I came up with an optimal decoration for Disney of 40 debt and the cost of capital is minimized at 11.64 percent they're actually at 12.22 Cost capital and 18 debt ratio they're under level so let's say disease management says we know we're on the level but we're going to choose to stay on the level because we want to preserve that that capacity to do great stuff so what does a great stuff have to be worth more than 54 basis points a year right because that's what you're giving up by being at this too high a costly capital so I'm going to try to put a number on how much Financial flexibility is worth using the option pricing framework so here's what I'm going to do for the expected reinvestment needs I'm going to look at how much Disney access capex and working capital sure as a percentage of value I want to scale things because I want to get as a personal value so in a typical year net capex working capital Acquisitions works out to about 5.3 percent here if you look at the standard deviation the number tends to jump around some years it's a much higher number some years it's a much lower now but it's unpredictable that that's what's going to give the option back that standard deviation is 0.375 what Disney can actually raise from its traditional use of debt and internal equities about 4.8 percent so that's what they can get from their cash flows and I'm going to Value this option as a one-year option why because I want to see whether I get more than that 58 basis points that I'm paying at a higher cost of capital trust me on this one but if you work through the numbers I get up a value of about 0.85 percent of value the financial flexibility is worth 85 basis points and I'm giving up only 58 basis points together so what's the bottom line when Disney States we're on delivered we're going to stay on the levit because we value Financial flexibility I'm gonna look at the number and say you're right you should stay under level because you do need to Value flexible it's a very difficult option to value but I think the implications of just trying it once are useful here's what I can make as a generalization about financial flexibility given that option argument first companies that are capital constrained should value Financial flexibility more than companies that are less Capital constrained imagine living in a world we could raise as much Capital as you wanted you don't need financial flexibility right great project comes along you go raise Capital who needs flexibility the more Capital constrained you are the more you will value Financial flexibility which means you're more likely to be under levered if you're a capital constraint I would expect small companies to Value Financial flexibility more than big companies why because small companies are more Capital constraints I would expect privately owned businesses to Value Financial flexibility more than publicly traded companies I would value expect Emerging Market companies to Value Financial flexibility more than develop Market confidence so Capital constraints play a big role here's the second Factor why do you need this financial flexibility to meet that unpredictable reinvestment in the future right keyword is unpredictable if you have predictable reinvestment needs you're an infrastructure company you know exactly what you need to invest for the next 10 years you don't need financial flexibility you can line up the financing right now the more unpredictable your reinvestment needs become the more you're going to Value Financial flexibility I'm not surprised when I see tech companies being among the most under levered companies in the market what technology is much more unpredictable than utilities are so when you look at companies the unpredictable every investment need kicks in and here's a final Factor Why would preserving the success capacity to take projects right but what if you're in a business with your typical project earns the cost to Capital there's zero value to flexibility then so if you're in the steel business in your automobile business don't even talk to me about financial flexibility I'm not interested in listening to it because there is no value added expect you're a software company and you want to talk about financial flexibility I'm willing to listen so as you look across companies there are some companies which will be under level that you're just going to let go and say that's okay other companies that aren't delivered are going to push and say you need to borrow more your financial flexibility argument Falls flat and again it's not the numbers of the option pricing but the implications that you take on which brings me to my last application of options and ironically it's the application that is most likely to find use when you value a company let's say you buy corn out the company why what's the big reason investors have for buying content it's not for Price appreciation it's not going to double in price it's a big dividend paying stock you buy it for the dividends if you buy in contrast Microsoft why why would people be interested in buying Microsoft now it's one of the best performing stocks this year grow the AI story it's because you think it's value is going concerned because if you bought Bed Bath and Beyond why would you buy Bed Bath and Beyond it's definitely not for the dividends right it's not for the cash flows you're buying it for the same reasons you buy a deep out of the money option right you buy it on a hope and a prayer you hope that something good will happen and you pray that something will happen most of the time what happens nothing good happens but maybe that one time out of 100 when something good happens it'll pop you're buying it as an option equity in a publicly traded company takes on the characteristic call option because of two properties that Equity has one is equities are residual claim could somebody explain to me what that means what does that mean receivable you in a typical normal year after everybody else gets paid you get whatever's left and even liquidation you get whatever is left after every other claim order it's a residual quick the second feature of equity is it as limited liability Yuki what does that what does that mean limited Library now it's what's the most you can lose your buyers shares in whatever you pay for the stock and thank God for that right you hit zero and say please God don't let it go any further and with Equity you're lucky because after zero the broker card because the price is now minus forty five dollars bring in an extra 45. with a private business you might have unlimited liability which means they can come after your personal assets after your business so Equity has a residual claim and it has limited Library I'm going to use those features to frame Equity as a collage so you're the equity investors in the company are you allowed to liquidate the company if you want to yeah the equity investors you can get together you can say we're liquidating the company you liquidate the company what happens you sell the assets you get the value of the firm you pay off the debt remember that's not an obligation you can escape and whatever is left over is yours so you get that difference what happens the value of the firm is less than the face value of the debt well you lose whatever you paid for the equity that's a limited that looks like a car option to me so I'm going to construct a very simplistic example but this example is going to allow me to extract all kinds of insights about both Corporate Finance evaluation so here you have a company I value the company the entire company the value of the company is 100 million but I'm uncertain about the Futures the standard deviation that value is 40 could be much higher much lower this company has one nice zero coupon Bond outstanding with a 10-year maturity and an 80 million dollar faceback in a second I'm going to ask you why I made this is zero coupon Bond netennial maturity but basically I have one 10 year zero coupon fund with an 80 million dollar face value the 10-year bond rate is 10 so I've given you the value of the company I've given you the standard deviation that value I've given you the debt as outstanding and the interest tenure key bond rate I'm going to argue that very limited information you should be able to tell me what the value the equity in this company's worth and what interest rate you would charge on the debt I've been given you cash flows I've been giving you betas cost of debt none of them guess how I'm going to do it I'm going to structure the equity of this company as a call option what is the underlying asset it's the basic the underlying business a hundred million dollar business that becomes the s in the model so the s in the model is the discounted cash flow evaluation of the operating assets you add for the company the exercise price if you decide to liquidate you got to pay the bondholders how much do you have to pay them 80 million dollars that becomes a strike price so you got a hundred million dollar s an 80 million dollar kit how long do you get to run the company until the end of the 10th year what happened to the end of the 10th year that might take the power out of your hands what comes to you the debt comes to you at which point the lender can say I'll shut you down you don't get that choice but for the next nine years and 364 days you're King of the castle you can do whatever you want now do you see why I made it as zero coupon Bond because the regular coupon Bond every year that'd be an interest payment due and if you can't make that payment so for Simplicity we've made ten years zero coupon the variance in firm value because I estimated the standard deviation to be 0.4 is 0.16.4 squared as your t-bond rate is 10 so I've got all the inputs I need I need for an option pricing model so plug the numbers in D1 D2 n of D1 n of D2 so that's pretty mechanical I'm going to come back and ask you whether there's some meaning at the end of D2 in a second but the value that I get for the call is 75.95 you're saying what the heck does that even tell you remember your equity in this company is a call option your Equity is what 75.9 format the total value of the company is a hundred million 75.94 million comes from Equity the remaining 24.06 million has to be debt the face value of the bond remember it's a zero coupon bond is 80 million it's worth 24.06 today the interest rate I can back out from those numbers is 12.77 as promised I gave you a value for the equity 75.94 I've told you what interest rate I'll be willing to pay on the debt 1.77 you Circle back though what does nd2 do you remember what nd2 roughly tells me but sir yes or sure property what so let's make it smoothie right property of in this case that s will be greater than KS is the value of the firm is greater than my face value of debt so there's a 63 chance that the value of the business is going to be greater than the debt that I owe which means it's a 37 chance of what what happens when the value of the debt is greater than the face value of the value of the debt is greater than the value of the firm you're bankrupt it's a 37 chance of bankruptcy so let's summarize with this company at a hundred million dollar valuation the value of the equity is 75.94 million the interest rate of the debt is 12.77 and there's a 37 chance that this company will go bankrupt as an outfit of the West Coast called kmb and what they do actually if you take a loan portfolio accompany them they assess a probability of bankruptcy for the company you know how they do it they put it through an option pricing model they take the end of D2 and 1 minus n of D2 becomes the likelihood that your company will go Banner so every comfortable 75.94 million Equity let's suppose you listen to me bad mistake and buy the equity for 75.9 tomorrow you wake up to some catastrophic news half the company has disappeared how can that happen you're one factory in Florida and one in California you take your pick a hurricane or an earthquake one of the factories is gone uninsured so your value of the business has gone from 100 million to 50 million as an equity investor is this good news of bad news what is a very perverse definition of good news this is really bad news right your Equity is going to be worth a lot less but I want to explore how much less do you see what I mean by that with 75.94 million before gave you three choices I took half of you know half of the value 50 million off maybe it'll drop to 25.9 for 50 million maybe it'll drop by less than 50 million which case somebody else has to Bear the remaining loss or maybe you listen to your accountants are probably going to give you a negative book Equity I'd say this Equity is worth nothing which do you think is the right choice you think it'll drop by less than 50 million about 50 million or more than 50 million it'll drop by less than 50 million in which case who's the only other player in this game who's left holding the back the debt holders do they want to be part of this game they say no no I don't want to be part of this no you're Dragged In whether you like it or not so let's see if that's true so what I did was I took the option pricing model lowered the value of the firm from 100 to 50 million so 50 million my value of equity is going to reflect the other inputs in the market remain exactly the same same face value debt same life as the option the value that I get for the equity is 30.44 used to be 75.94 it's dropped by 45 and a half million the value the debt dropped by four and a half million that's the sharing that the equity investors do on the way down say come on in you share the pain as well in fact once I got started on this process I could not stop myself let me explain I dropped the value from 100 to 50. and I dropped it to 40 then to 30 then to 20. you know what I was trying to answer when does Equity become worthless in this company and the answer was I couldn't make Equity go away it's an incredibly stubborn instrument I dropped the value of the business to 5 million I dropped it to 3 million remember it still owes 80 million and the equity hung in this so what's keeping equity afflon gear go ahead that's half of it it's voluntary and time you have 10 years now and what are you hoping so I describe this hope and a prayer hoping that something good will happen you're praying that something good will happen most of the time nothing good will happen but that hope and prayer keeps value it gives me an entire now it gives me an entirely different perspective on what bankruptcy actually means actually my daughter went to just turned 28 three days ago told me this when she was three years old she's a financial genius not really but not relaxed like she is it was a summer where I was playing Monopoly with my two older Sons and she would insist on joining in very persistent little creature so finally we let her in and after the first game I had to Banner because she was like a one-man Enron she you know how in Monopoly you take 200 every time you press go she would take 200 wherever whenever she felt like it she put up hotels and properties that didn't belong to her charge you when you went by so finally I said Kendra you can't play this game and you're done tiny person horrible temper she starts walking and say you're bankrupt you're bankrupt you're bankrupt very impressive three-year-old would know the word bankruptcy said Kendra what does bankrupt mean expecting an answer like the value of your outstanding liabilities she said bankrupt means you don't get to play the game anymore you know what that's a very insightful definition of bankruptcy because as long as I get to play the game for nine years and 364 days I'm not bankrupt yet that's what's keeping the equity afloat the closer I get to the end of year 10 the closer to zero my value is but as long as time is on my side yeah so if you're wondering who's buying bed badminton no you can actually buy shares at Bed Bath and Beyond still even though it's in bankruptcy you think who's doing it it's people who are buying deep part of the money auctions you know that you could have bought Continental Airlines now it's part of United in 1993 for 23 cents a share three years later those shares were worth 53 dollars per share 23 cents you work out the percentage return that's what you're hoping for and it doesn't have to be one in ten only has to be one in fifty that takes off it's a deep out of the money option I'm going to use this to kind of illustrate another problem as well in corporate finance we talk about how incentives are different for Equity investors as opposed to lenders now to illustrate that danger of what happens when you're a lender to a company I'm going to take the company with just value before the catastrophe 75.94 million in equity 24.06 million debt value the firm is 100 million I'm going to play the role of a project salesperson and I'm going to come to you with a project that I'm trying to sell it you ready now walk into your office and say I have a project for you you're trained in corporate financing so what's the Net Present Value I say minus 2 million get ready to throw me out right I said no no wait not only is negative net personal it's a very risky project this is going from bad to us so you want me to take a bad very risky project you know what there might be a reason you might want to take this project right you take this project let's see what happens in numbers first the 100 million dollar value for the firm is going to become 98 million remember Net Present values are additive you take a minus two million dollar project the value of the firm drops you see there I told you we shouldn't have done this it's a risky project so the 16 variance becomes 25.25 basically you increase the standard deviation of that do you remember what the value of your Equity was before you took this bad project 75.94 It's Magic I took a bad risky project and your Equity is now worth 77.719 what's this magic happening from where did that additional value come from the volatility right it's not it's got to come out of somebody's pocket whose pocket have I just picked I picked my debt holder's pocket they're the ones effectively paying for not just the negative Net Present Value but for the added value you know the lesson you should take away from this never led to a highly level company without getting protections without being part of decisions because otherwise you'd risk being taken to the cleaners because those Equity they're not being irrational they're doing what's right for them I've never understood why Banks lend on lbos as passive blenders I've never understood how to get away with it makes no sense at all to me to let KKR decide what's good for them and say hey we're going to go along for the right they're going on there right you might not be on that same Drive so interesting twist that you can see using the option pricing model one final example the conventional wisdom we're going to talk about Acquisitions today is you can pay fair value on a company your Equity should be on effect like taking zero Net Present Value project so let's say you are you go out and you acquire another company for 150 million the fair value is 150 million you pay for that and ask you what will happen to your typical Equity value is 75.94 before you did this so what will happen to your value based on traditional the answer most people get is nothing should happen it's a fair value acquisition let's say that's true there's your company right that's a company you're acquiring you're paying fair value but here's what you're not factoring in both companies are risky companies standing alone but what happens if I combine two risky companies remember that when you did portfolio theory that first step you do a two asset portfolio it's very into the first asset times weight Square to the first asset come on you should you should remember this from foundations weight of the second asset Square Times variance the second and I said Plus what's the last term it's a covariance term right two times weight one weight two times covariance which means that the standard deviation of the combined firm can actually be lower than the standard deviation the individual funds and in this case that's what happens you're saying so what you see the consequences for you as an equity investor by combining two risky firms you made a combined firm that's safe if you look at the value of the equity as after this deal even though it's a fair value deal the value of the combined Equity drops by 3 million so what's happening here where's that 3 million going who's benefiting from this merger lenders and now tell me how wide works out if you're a lended to these two girls so you'd lenders to both companies why would lenders in both companies be happier after the merger than before the merger it's safer and you lend money at an interest rate that reflected the riskiness of those firms so basically you're charging an interest rate that reflects risky companies and I've created a safer company so if you're a manager in a company that is doing conglomat this is a classic conglomerate do you go buy companies and other businesses the way you claw back this benefit is by either renegotiating the interest rate with lenders but if they don't agree to that know what else you can do borrow more money as you do acquisition so you can get that debt value back to yourself so it's a good way to think about how these processes plan so let's talk about applying this on a real company because as I said some of you have money losing companies with a lot of debt you need both conditions you see why because it's a Liquidation option and without the debt face value you're not going to get the equity option to have anywhere so let's say you have a money losing company a lot of debtors looking at my example saying how the heck am I going to take my company and make it fit these characteristics because it's very the example I showed you is very simplistic I gave you the value of the company I gave you a standard deviation I made it at one nice zero coupon Bond due in 10 years no troubled company ever fits those needs so I'll give you the way in which I tried to make a real company squeeze through into my simplistic example you asked me for a value of the firm you know what I'm going to do I'm going to go to my DCF valuation look at the DCF value for my operating assets and that's going to become the s in my model so I've done a discounted cash flow valuation already I don't have to start from scratch right this option argument is an extension of a discounted cash flow evaluation not an alternative so I start with the DCF value you say what if I haven't done a dcfi I might do a pricing based on revenues ebitda something to come up with what would I get if I liquidated the company that's my S for my variance I'm in trouble right because I need a variance in firm value if the shares and the bonds of this company are traded I can again constructive variance and put them value by taking away the damage but I'm too lazy to do that so I'm going to do what I did when we did pay this what did I what did I say was the best way to estimate beta for your company look at the average set I actually I bought them up very interested in firm value on my website for difference so you have a troubled Steel company I give you a variance of a typical Steel company you have a troubled Chemical Company I'll give you the variance of a typical to use that it's a much easier input and actually a better estimate than trying to build up to it from scratch so I got the S I've got the sigma but the value of the debt I'm going to cheat by taking all of your debt I'm going to 15 different ad issues adding them all together and trading it as a record one gigantic zero coupon it's not the way the world is but I'm going to make it squeeze in there and I'm going to take a weighted average of the durations if I can get them but if I cannot I'll take the weighted average mature so what I've done is taken all of your debt and replaced with knights 190 couponing I'm home free I can do an option pricing mode so you may try this out in a real company company called Euro tunnels it's a hole in the ground where cash goes in but never seems to come out connecting England and France it's been around a long time it's a history of losing money in fact this was in 1997 when they lost 56 million pounds as operating losses and 685 million pounds as net losses losing a lot of money first condition man in fact they've been losing money for so long their book Equity had turned Negan so first condition money losing company check that box do they have a lot of that boy do they have a lot of debt 8.9 billion pounds in debt a lot of it very long term debt it's an infrastructure company so money losing company the Lord of that and looks like I should be able to apply option price so first thing I did was I did a discounted cash flow valuation that's why I said option pricing is not an alternative to DCF so many of you already have the DCF value for your company we decide to do an option pricing that becomes yes in the market the value that I got for your return assuming it makes it back to health was 2.3 billion shots do you remember what I put it on the previous page how much debt did it have almost 9 billion right this is with recovery with margins improving I get a value of 2.3 billion pounds deep out of the money harsh and for the variance I actually computed the standard deviations I was able to get both eurotunnel shares and bonds for trade I wish I could have found an industry average but in 1997 there weren't too many infrastructure companies were publicly traded so I computed the variance in firm value by taking the variance in stock prices which is you know standard deviation is 4.41 standard deviation bond prices and that last term which looks mysterious is the covariance stuff that's a very interesting firm value I've got everything I need to value your Eternal Equity as an option my S is my DC I've added 2.3 billion Parts my K is my outstanding debt 8.9 billion pounds this is a deep out of the money option the only saving grace is that debt is really long term it's not due under 10.93 years that's a weighted average duration what I did was I took each individual debt issue computed the duration of each one took away to damage you could use a weighted average maturity if you you know clearly you can get away with it and the variance is 0.0335 remember what the probability of failure was in my hypothetical example our computer can somebody tell me what the likelihood that your internal will go bankrupt is based on the black shows model what do I look at 1 minus n of D2 there's a 92 and a half percent chance that the Euro tunnel will fail that surprised me not in the least but here's the magic it's a deeply distressed company right it's never made money its Book value of equity is negative your discounted cash flow valuation says this is the company in shambles the value of the equity is 122 million bucks what's keeping it afloat time and hope maybe the Sultana Brunei will come in and say I'll buy the tunnel and pay five times the value if you put my name on it you can hope right you have 10.93 years to hold when you think about deeply troubled companies you basically have to stop thinking in traditional terms and think in very different terms you have to think of it as an option you see why that matters right so I ask you would you buy a deeply troubled Safe Company or a deeply troubled risky company but yeah which one should you buy I would always buy the risky one you're buying an option now right you have to change every so this is called vulture investing there are people who actually do it they buy equities in deeply troubled companies they might buy 50 different ones even the most successful vulture investors 40 of the 50. you know what's going to happen to the equity it's going to go to zero the 10 that pay off or the seven that payoff pay off so big that they cover the remaining 42 or 43 and make more for them it's a very different way of thinking about investing because risk is now your ally you know what if you're drowning does it make a difference between around 12 feet of water is 16 feet of water I think you're going to be dead either way right if you have deeply distressed Equity you know what you have right you have companies that are way below what they're saying you know what there's no I need risk as my Ally to get above the water the risk is your only chance of making it bad there's some sectors where I start with the default that I really am getting an option I'll give you my favorite the airline business right 90 of Airlines you're not buying a going concern you're not buying a collection of dividends you're buying an auction in fact that's why last week's you know the valuation tools webcasts used in Indian airline called Jet Airways at the you know whatever it got in trouble it valued as an option Air India which is a you know an Indian airline company going back in times the oldest the airline companies recently got sold by the Indian government to the Tata group for like a few hundred million you know people look and say why would you pay a few hundred million for an airline that is effectively bankrupted losing money they were buying an option it changes your mindset and that I think is the most useful thing that comes out of thinking about options in equity yes because there's enough grads for a wealth from the lenders for your Equity investors to be worth more right so the the our measure for whether cash should be discounted is we're valuing the entire business when so this is about allocating value my value for the business actually went down when I did this but again because I stole from my bond orders it's a game under a game so you're often looking at where the wealth transfer is coming from right so think about this the the applications we had for most of you you cannot try the Pharma applications because you need details and patents that you cannot get natural resource applications are much more difficult to do because you can't get those undeveloped results the kind of detail but if you have a troubled company you've had trouble getting that Equity value to be greater than zero Asia for instance has struggled all semester trying to get an equity value above zero right your BCF value was zero one was actually negative which is effectively zero your pricing you're probably going to end up with the same zero value because the same factors are going to come in this might be only chance of getting you got actually a positive number congratulations right this might be our only chance of getting your number above zero is the only reason people are buying this company is because you know one of the ways this option pays off is somebody acquires the company for some small piece of the company it pays a huge premium for it that's what you're paying for that's what the option pricing model is captured you need a lot of debt without the debt you don't get the Liquidation option because without it you can't get that difference so let's do the last the last the one of the last two slides which is Acquisitions about uh 20 years ago student of mine who graduated 10 years prior called me and he said look I'm running a seminar his job was to run executive seminars for CEOs and CFO and he said I'm running a seminar for CFOs of companies and I said I'm not interested in talking to them I said can I tell you more he said okay he said these are CFOs of Serial acquires you know Siri requires like a book of the month club these companies do an acquisition of the Month Club he said you know I would like you to come in and talk to him I said you got the right are you sure you're talking to the right guy you know what I think about Acquisitions right he said I do but I would like you to come in and talk to them anyway because for the rest of the day they're going to hear from Bankers what do bankers think about Acquisitions it's the mother's milk of all deal making this is the greatest thing on the face of the Earth he said I'd like you to be the antidote I said okay give me the last 45 minutes so I showed up and I put this page up and it kind of captures what I think about acquisitions so it acquires Anonymous seven steps back to sobriety because I'm convinced that Acquisitions are an addiction that once a company starts to grow through Acquisitions it doesn't want to go back to doing projects think of how much work it is to do 100 projects as opposed to one big acquisition not to mention the egos you know stroking you get when you do a big acquisition your names in the Wall Street Journal the CEO of the acquiring company so I'm going to give you my very dyspeptic view of what I think about Acquisitions before I do that I want to get a sense of how many of you are graduating and going to work in an m a department at an investment Bank nobody wants to admit to it maybe after this session none of you will want to go work there or maybe everybody will want to work there but let me start by laying out my foundation for why I am so negative about acquisitions we all know when Acquisitions hit the news right you get a new story so and so is acquiring so so and often the focus is on the target company but I would suggest you look at the acquiring company as well because you'll tell you see two very different stories player on the date the acquisition is announced the target Company stock price jumps why it's good news right no target company shareholders ever said this oh my God my company's being acquired I feel terrible you feel great why because people are paying a premium for your ships like one of the interesting things is there's a jump on the acquisition day but there tends to be a drift in the days before which tells us what either remarkably perceptive markets or somebody's leaking information somewhere right so that's clearly leakage going on we want no no from what's causing it but Target company shareholders are clearly the winners what about acquiring company shareholders they may and then it gets worse than men basically there's not much happening and then up and as the acquisition is announced the price starts to turn down if you look at the percentages they look disproportionate there's a 25 jump in the Target company only a two percent drop in the acquiring company but what are you not factoring in when you just compare those numbers the typical acquiring company somebody said scale typical acquiry company is usually much much bigger than the typical Target company on the day that Microsoft announced and was buying Activision Activision stock price obviously jumped 35 Microsoft stock price dropped by only three percent but then you got to factor in the Microsoft is a two billion dollar company and Activision is a 75 billion dollar company that's very I mean that almost looks like a wash that whatever you saw in Activision came out of Microsoft's back so on the day of the acquisition clearly if you ask the acquiring company share order CFOs why are you doing this this is not creating value for us you know what the response is going to be right you haven't seen what we've seen which is what we've made forecasts of synergy as far as the eye can see the big numbers you don't have access to that that's why you're being so negative let's get to the benefit of the doubt if that were the case when you track acquisition the years after the acquisition what should you say good stuff happening right acquiring companies should get richer more profitable earn high returns because all that Synergy that the banker short is starting to show up McKenzie and KPMG have over the last four years I asked this question repeatedly so they go in five years after merger McKenzie would ask two basic questions does the return on invested capital in this acquisition exceed the cost to Capital that sounds familiar question we ask about any project and then they ask do parent companies actually do better after Acquisitions relative to their peer group than before because Synergy is paying off you should have higher margins higher returns and the answer is no to both questions in most mergers KPMG actually asked a different question they looked at 9 000 mergers around the world to ask a singular question what's a word that you see shop in merge or after merger the big word that explains away the premium Synergy they said how often does synergy actually show up at companies they found that in one in six cases out of every nine in the nine thousand one in six cases Synergy shows up in two to three out of six there's no Synergy and in but two out of six is actually negative Synergy what does that mean two companies come together the combined company actually gets less profitable than the two companies coming together so there's no evidence that Acquisitions pay off on the date it's announced there's no evidence if you track through time that they pay off in fact half of all mergers are reversed within 10 years of being done because they don't work so the collective evidence on Acquisitions is not a good one until about 20 years ago all of this evidence came from looking at U.S companies because that's where the data was and at about 20 years ago we looked at an acquiring company and Target company acquiring company usually came from a developed Market U.S Europe and the target company was usually from an emerging market right you bought an Indian company Chinese companies well the worm is good now Indian companies are now in a position to be acquirers of UK companies and U.S companies and one of the most painful things to see is the same phenomena you saw with U.S companies is playing out in every single other Market this is not just a U.S Centric problem of people overpaying this seems to be a problem with acquisition this is actually from a study of Indian companies that do Acquisitions at the acquiring company is actually an interesting result around the day of the acquisition of the months the stock price actually goes up it's almost like a patriotic further kicks in said finally an Indian companies taking over a U.S company let's push the price up and then the hangover kicks in saying that wasn't good so by 24 months after you're saying I wish they hadn't done that okay what I'm trying to say is this is a problem globally it occurs across time and across across different markets which tells me that there's something wrong with the process because it can't be something that's easy that that that that you that's fixable because by this time it should have been fixed so there's no that if you look at the collective evidence it requires overpayer and acquisition that what they perceive and value of synergy doesn't often show up and say why don't they fix it I think part of the problem is the process we've talked about what's wrong with the m a process remind me again how the process plays out I'm an acquiring company I see a Target company of interest it's a friendly merch so what do we do next we go to a banker the game is done the bankers come in what's the objective as a banker what's your what you want you want to get the deal done right why because and you can't be it's not because they're bad people but because we've loaded the incentive structure because if one of the bankers comes to you and says look this is a bad deal let's not do it it's very honest of that Banker but what do you get out of it nothing so what I'd like to do is actually take you through the seven most common sins in Acquisitions so actually when I did this in front of the CFOs of Serial acquires I gave them a deal none of them took me up on it I said look I'm going to pass you through seven tests if you fail more than two can you please stop doing acquisitions they wouldn't take it on but no you're welcome to take on the challenge so I'm going to take you to the seventh sense first is what I want to call risk transfers in a minute you're going to see exactly what I mean when I describe the process the second is what I call debt subsidies right acquiring from subsidizes a Target firm because the acquiring firm has access to cheap debt in a lot of debt the third is no control remember the 20 premium that I said Bankers add I'm going to give you the source of that 20 and why it's so dangerous to slap it onto every acquisition then I want to confront Synergy clearly it's a one big word in valuation I know one of the first questions I asked CFOs and mergers is can you value Synergy and they said maybe maybe not it's subjective I say you're paying in subjective dollars for this acquisition or objective daughters the minute you pay a 25 million free if you lost that subjective I can't make an essay but of course it can be value then I want to talk about pricing in the context of Acquisitions how do we price companies we find comparables we pick a multiple and we price a company right I'm going to argue that that process is particularly skewed in acquisitions by the way we pick comparables and the way we pick multiples six I want to talk about how there's a version of what happened we read Alice in Wonderland now Alice wonders of the Queen's court and the queen says verdict first trial afterwards sometimes in Acquisitions you get that Sensation that the decision is already being made before the process even gets started and the decision is often made at the very top this no middle manager wakes up and says let's go do an acquisition the CEO has some dream in the middle of the night and he wakes up and says you know what I want to do an acquisition and the process plays out and there's a final component of acquisition that really bugs you're a manager a company you take a bad project you lose 20 million you get fired you're a management company you do a terrible acquisition you pay a 20 billion dollar premium you shouldn't have you get promoted don't ask me why this works out that way but nobody ever seems to lose their job after bad acquisitions so let's start this game by setting this page up I'd like you to set this page up for yourself and with each test I'm going to take you through a test I want you to be honest with yourself you don't have to be honest with me and see if you pass the test and if you pay more than two please don't go to Eminem so let's start the process up I'm going to keep the numbers simple so you don't need to calculate to do this let's suppose I come to you with the target company so here's what the numbers look like revenues of 100 million operating expenses of 80 million operating income of 20 minutes taxes of 8 million after tax operating number 12. let's keep things simple and assume that this company has zero growth in perpetual how does it make life simple for you what does it do you don't need reinvestments your after tax operating becomes your free cash flow so you have 12 million in free cash flow this company is all Equity Finance I told you I was going to keep things simple simple and the cost of equity is 20 so your cost of capital is also 20 you ready that's my first question forget about the acquisition if I ask you to Value this target company as a standalone company what's the value you'd come up with the company 60 million right 12 million divided by 0.260 million you know why I want you to have that base number because my job for the next 25 minutes is to convince you to pay more than 50 60 Minutes come up with every trick in the book I'm going to try to get you to pay a free see here's my first string I said but you're a Safe Company your cost of equity is only 10 you see where I'm going right what am I trying to get you to do I'm trying to get to use your 10 cost of equity to Value the target company which case what's the 60 million going to become 120 million and if you do that plus you've overpay but you've set yourself on a path to keep all the paying right because now I know you're a sucker so what do I do I find every risky company I can I'm going to come and say look it looks cheap and it will look cheap to you because you apply it then this is how a t drove itself from being a hundred billion dollar company down to almost zero before somebody woke up and said we've got our objective mixed up it's not to minimize value it's to maximize value we have to stop doing this well it's true in acquisition is when you value a Target company keep the risk at the Target company level it's a it's a discounted cash flow rule this risk in it the should flow is not the risk of The Entity I just remember about 20 years ago when G was at its peak of its Glory right there's a right after the the build up Jack Welsh days of the largest market cap company in the world I got invited to Stamford which is where their headquarters were and said can you come and talk to our divisional hats I don't know what got into my head I said yes I show up and you know there's like an Amphitheater there with the divisional heads and I go through I did the acquires anonymous because G was an episode of company I get to this point and I say should value a Target company using its risk profile look around the room and everybody has a very sheepish look and I said would you guys do this right it's a normal G we use G's cost of capital to Value Target company so why would you do something that's stupid they said we're so big they're so small what difference does it make I said if you take a Krispy Kreme donut and cut into 24 pieces and eat all 24. how many calories do you think you'll get it's really tiny pieces right but by the time you finish all 24 you're going to get the same number of calories and eating the whole damn thing you do 24 small Acquisitions you screw up the same way in all 24. you add them all up you get a Krispy cream acquisition right you just overpaid collectively there is no excuse for using and acquiring company's cost of equity but of all acquisitions I see acquiring companies cost of equity being used to Value Target companies second step so that didn't work on you because you were too sensible you've taken valuation classes no no I will use the target company's cost of equity so I compute from a different direction I say you know what you have access to a lot of debt at really low cost let's say the after tax cost debt is only four percent and you plan to use half of the capital you plan to borrow money you see what I'm trying to lead you right what's the cost of capital it's a weighted average if your cost of equity in your cost of debt half your money is now going to come from debt I know you're supposed to leverage the cost of equity let's assume that you know I'll let you get by that 20 is from the cost of equities is 20 half comes from Equity half comes from debt at four percent so my cost of capital is going to be what it's going to be 12 right down the middle I discount the 12 million at 12 I get a hundred I told you I was going to try to get you to pay more than 60 minutes so I'm now saying look because you have access to a lot of cheap debt and you have a lot of you know why do you use a 12 cost of Gap it's more reasonable right after all you have access to cheap debt what's wrong with doing that what's wrong with taking your cost of debt as the acquiring company Your Capacity to borrow money and using that in the cost account you're going to pay a premium of 40 million right to the Target company shareholders for what why where's the premium coming from the fact that you have a really high rating how do you get it by working 100 years and building a nice Safe Company you've given it away some Target company shareholders with absolutely nothing to do with this Render unto the target company shareholders that which is theirs and not a penny more when you use your cost of debt and your capacity to borrow money to push down the cost of capital and effects subsidizing the target company shareholders for something that no role in creating so in value a Target firm my advice is do not bring in the acquiring firm's capacity to borrow money or it's cheap debt into the mix you might still use it I'm not saying you shouldn't use it but don't bring it in value the target company because you're going to then pay a premium for something the target company shareholders have no role in creating you see it's really making it really difficult for me to acquire a company you're absolutely right I'm trying to make it more difficult because you saw the end result of what happened and I make it too easy you go to these Acquisitions you ruin value and there's nothing I have to show for it as a shareholder stop three so the first two did not try you're too Savvy for me I said but in Acquisitions it's common practice to add a 20 premium you say controller what it's control premium so where did that come from most of the time the banker would not know the answer but I'll fill in the detail as to where the 20 came from it came from looking at all acquisitions on a database called mergistat which you actually have access to as a Stern student which has every acquisition and taking the difference between the price paid and an acquisition versus the market price before the acquisition it's the average premium pay you said what's wrong with using that what goes into that premium some of it is for control right what else is in there synergy what about stupidity when you overpay for something where does it go because in the premium as well so essentially there's a stupidity component you're saying everybody else is stupid I'm going to be stupid as well it's not a great strategy to create value over time I've never understood how people can get away applying that 20 because it has to be company specific you want to give see an example of company specific control premium example I just showed you remember that 100 million revenues and 20 million in habit 20 let's assume you think you can run the company more efficient the existing management is just sloppy and inefficient if I asked to do value company with you running it you're going to replace the 20 margin with the 30 margin your 12 million will become 18 million your 60 million will become 90 million in that you see why nothing else is changing you've edited that's your value of control would you should he pay the 30 million as your premium on the acquisition if you're dead what have you done you've taken the 30 million value you're going to get with your hard work and given it away to the Target company shareholders up front how do you win at this game do you keep doing that but the premium you see as a control premium should depend on how well or badly a company is Right badly run companies that premium can be much bigger so when you think about these rules of the term evaluation everybody else does it 20 premiums there now dig a Little Deeper because there's a huge variation in premiums across companies and then think about from your perspective does it make sense in this acquisition to pay a premium in the first place perfectly management perfectly run this no premium for control because the company already is well advantaged in fact in the next session we'll actually get an expected value for control for any company it's easy to do it requires you value the company twice status form run differently run by you so that's a value control which brings us to that magical word synergy I'll give you my definition of synergy it's going to be very specific and the reason I'm going to be specific is I think people use the word Synergy to fit in whatever they want to me synergies two companies coming together are able to do something as a combined company that they could not have done as Standalone companies let me repeat that again the essence of synergy is two companies coming together and doing something they could not have done as Standalone companies so the value synergy I need to have it show up remember the proposition in the cash flows or in the discount rate and I make a statement up front and try to back it up most synergies are cash flow synergies there are very few synergies and publicly traded companies that show up at discount rates because your two public companies coming together there's very little argument you can make that somehow magically you can create a public company that has a lower cost of capital just because you combine two public companies and here again you'll have to confront the issue after you valued Synergy you have to decide what share of that belongs to you because remember you need both the acquiring and the target couple of decisions show up it's silly to leave a hundred percent of the target company shareholders because you contribute as much and sometimes more to this process than they do so Microsoft is buying Activision because it believes it as a combined company they can do better in the med of us whatever that means then there's going to be some component of Microsoft that you need for this to work because otherwise Activision could have done it to itself and if you're on Microsoft you need to negotiate for that share to remain with Microsoft shares so let's talk about the different forms that Synergy can take Synergy can either be operating Synergy or financial synergy the two operating Synergy first the easiest operating Synergy to value is economies of scale cost savings what kinds of mergers you most likely to see cost savings or cognitive scale mergers in the same business usually right when embed the global Brewer bought Modelo the Mexican growing company one of the reasons they did it was they said look we are a global Brewer we have Distribution Systems we can shut down matella's distribution system we can replace them with us and we have a huge marketing program we can slip in modelo's marketing and there will cut costs and we can use modelo's products and give them a much bigger Market as well because we have this global distribution system but the cost savings essentially came almost instantaneously they were able to cut costs almost 30 percent right after the margin the reason it's easy to Value it's concrete it's right there it lowers your cost it increases your profits you've flown through the cash flows you're done that's economies of scale but let's talk about the this mergers that show up in growth first it can be in the form of a higher return on Capital you earn on your existing project it's a combined company you're able to earn a 12 internal Capital ten percent return Capital this is a combined firm you're stronger it could be that you could reinvest more a develop Market brand name company buys an Emerging Market brand name company that's they can take more projects because both products now have a bigger Market to cater to it could also be a longer growth period because you combined as a company and become stronger comparatively just don't let the Anti-Trust guys know that this is the reason you're doing it because they might stop you right because that's their job is to make sure that doesn't happen but implicitly there's some kind of problem the do you see what I'm trying to do I'm trying to take the word Synergy and say where in my valuation can I show it is a return capital reinvestment rate the growth rate the cash flows because ultimately it's got to show up there those are operating Services I would love to tell you that most synergies and merges are operating synergies but they're not to me I mean I look at mergers about 70 percent of synergies emerges of financial synthesis and the most common Financial Synergy is like the I call it the Voldemort synergy synergy that should not be named don't talk about it this is the reason what am I talking about tax savings if you're saying I'm doing this much of a tax savings for God's sakes talk about everything but taxes talk about AI it has nothing to do with the merger but yeah I make well it seems to work out as chat GPT about why I should do the merger gave me lots of good reasons look at these two pages that it get and I is an example I think about about six years ago Pfizer announced they were going to merge with allergic which is a UK based pharmaceutical company everybody knew it was all about taxes because in those days U.S tax laws require that you pay U.S taxes on global income and Pfizer did not want to do it by merging without again and becoming a uk-based company you essentially ship tax codes and everybody knew it and the CEO of Pfizer gets on CNBC and he must have been drunk I think as CNBC anchor I said well why are you planning on doing this much and the CEO says because we want to save on taxes I remember hitting my head against all saying what are you doing because you could see what could you could see exactly what was going to happen after the CNBC interview the IRS started saying you know we will take a look at this mergers Senator start digging over the floor saying this is about saving taxes two weeks later the deal was dead so if you're going to do a merger because you'll save on taxes talk about strategic considerations talk about China talk about everything but taxes hoping that nobody notices why you really do it saying how am I going to save taxes in a merger one is you're allowed to write a passage after a merger you understand in fact this is the game that that accountants do offer emerge and they come in and they write up assets and a higher Book value allows you more depreciation more tax benefits and there are some countries where the tax code actually gives you a benefit from emerge my favorite example is uh Brazil Brazil about 30 years ago the Brazilian government decided that because the tax law was tilted towards that how interest expense is deductible they were going to try to make it fair by giving an equivalent tax deduction for equity and the way it works in prison it's called interested in capital if you're allowed to take your book equity and every year the government will give you a percentage number 12 so you take 12 book Equity you're allowed to claim it as a tax deduction you're saying so what what happened to your book Equity operator merger usually goes up right because in a sense you brought up you bought a company for market value bring it into Goodwill as an asset pretty Book value of equity goes up the day that embev was acquired by this Belgian Brewer called him now it's the heart of what's now the global company 80 of the Synergy from that merger came from writing up book values and the higher tax benefits that's a financial bank you can have two companies which by themselves can't borrow much money because they're risky companies but you combine them they might be able to borrow money how does that help you higher debt ratio lower cost of capital however if a public company uses the argument that they're doing an acquisition just for diversification what should you push crackling I can diverse I've never paid a 30 premium have you guys paid a 30 premium on Schwab on links I'd like to pay a 30 premium you paid market price right when you do an acquisition a company does it as pay 20 25 30 premium if the only reason is diversification I can do it much more cheaply than any company that I own shares but there's one exception to the rule that diversification cannot be a good reason for a merger let's say you're the owner of a private business what's a baby that we use to come up with your cost of equity a total beta right what went into total beta a market beta and a correlation with the market that private business owner now goes and buys a second business in a second company in a different business what should happen to the correlation of that combined company with the market it should go up as you start to diversify the correlation to decrease if you look at Family Group companies especially very old family group companies in Asia and Latin America take a look at what businesses they're in you know what you're going to very quickly find they're in everything but that's how they survive because until about 40 years ago before public markets that's how family group survived you don't want to be a family group Steel company it would be a family group it's steel and chemicals and financial services you create in a sense your own diversification within the company because you had no choice so when somebody says there is synergy in the merger what's your what do you have to do you have to ask the question what form where will it show up because you've got to put that into the numbers so I'm going to give you the three-step process for computing the value of symmetry this is your counter to anybody who says I cannot value synergy First Step you value the acquiring company and the target company as Standalone companies let me repeat again you cannot value Synergy by just looking at the Target company you've got to Value the acquiring company and the target company is Standalone summons step two just add the values that you got in step one together what is that going to give me it's going to give me the value the combined company if there were no synergy step three throw everything but the kitchen sink into the internet I think this merger will cut costs increase growth rate reduce cost to Capital I'm going to put it put that all in and in step three I'm going to Value the combined company with all the Synergy spare time so what should I get in step three is my combined company's value a much higher number than I got in step two by just adding up to two values that difference is the value of symmetry so I'm going to try this on the company yeah from 20 years ago Procter Gamble then the largest consumer product company in the world acquired Gillette the sixth largest huge merger and talk of synergy filled here so I decided I wanted to Value Synergy to see whether this was a good deal for Procter and gambling shareholders so value Procter Gamble standing alone came up with a value of 221 billion valued Gillette standing alone came up with a value of 60. so that's step one you add the two numbers up you get 281 billion that's step two that's the value of the company that you have got I'd name the combined company piglet that's not the name they chose Proctor and Gamble Gillette they decide to stay with Procter Gamble but let's call it piglet to separate it from PNG before so it's piglet after piglet without Synergy is worth 281 Bill and then I did a best case valuation of synergy let me explain why I called it best case I took everything managers said they would do after the merger assumed they would do it and do it instantaneously which almost never happens so I gave them a higher growth rate I assume they cut costs by 250 million came up with the value the combined company with the Synergy built in 298 bit there's a Canard that in valuation we don't think Synergy is valid that's not true I'm giving a 17 billion dollar value to Synergy this is a good deal for Procter shareholders what have I not told you though how much they paid as a premium they paid a 25 million dollar premium and this is why Acquisitions fail is because people don't want to put numbers incentive they want to use it as a plug bearing that's why they want to leave it subjective and qualitative because it'll expand to fill in whatever you pay but if you and this is the best case valuation in fact Let me throw it to a few what apps what if I have to wait three years for this Synergy to show up after all these are two big companies it'll take a while for the Synergy to show up how would I bring that in so 17 billion is my best case value but if I have to wait three years to discount it back now comes a tough question like what this country who's getting the savings the combined company right you these are combined companies cost to Capital Discount back 17 billion is going to become 14 and a half billion it's a very flexible technique you can bring in whatever you want to bring in but you have to factor it take a second example of synergy seen it at one time was one of the best known names in electronics in the US you've seen as TVs by the time I did this though you know the only acid Zenith had left that accumulated a lot of loss it's kind of a sorry state for a company look how much we've accumulated then what so let's assume your Best Buy and you're acquiring Zenith for one reason and one reason alone you want those NOS two billion dollars in announce what's that cash flow benefit of getting an anova what is it how does it help you pay less in taxes right so if you have a 36 tax rate and this is how most Bankers deal with NOS they multiply the tax rate by the nol which will give you 720 million dollars in tax benefits but that assumes you have 2 billion in taxable income right now to set the annual against it 500 million in taxable income every year for the next four years what is that going to do you're still going to get the 720 million but you're going to get 180 million every year for the next four years right how would I value it you'd have to take a present value get ready for the question what this contract should I use but that what's the risk here I gave you an expected operating income right not a guaranteed operating income if I gave you no guaranteed operating income you could use the risk free rate but to the extent that operating income is uncertain I'll have to Discount those tax savings back and that's effectively why you see me use annual world's carrying your time in my DCF model is I don't allow you to take the tax credit right way I look to see when you make their income and I discount those tax benefits back to today at the cost of capital so Synergy can be valued because you're willing to pay for it but because it's become a buzzword people feel the urge to let's pay a premium there's Synergy here to look past the buzzwords ask questions and people are incredibly slippery they do not want to be specific about synergy but that's a red flag remember I told you that only one in six mergers in kpfg looked at had surgery one of the common characteristics they noticed in these mergers is the planning for Synergy happened before the merger was actually done now the people that actually put down on paper what they did and then somebody was held accountable for delivering on those numbers here's my advice to you whenever you have these Acquisitions there's always somebody the company is pushing really hard for the acquisition they wanted to get done they hire the bankers they've mastered them through the process I would make that person responsible for delivering the numbers that I base the acquisition on so okay you think there's a lot of synergy we'll do it but by the way you are responsible for delivery you'll be amazed at how quickly the numbers will come down to become more realistic when people realize I'm supposed to deliver those numbers okay let me be more realistic about it so buzzwords are buzzwords paying a premium for them is a recipe for disaster we don't have enough time this next session we start we talk about pricing in the context of synergies and we'll talk about how to change value in a company but keep working on your project keep getting get me get your pricing done and I will talk to you on Wednesday foreign check one two test test s yeah right foreign I don't know that's probably meant to you oh it's going down here Jared is fine Gary told me the last week that's fine thank you no I just I want hello Andrew the transmitter is on I don't know if you can get the signal we have the signal good all right he says good yeah making sure you here do you see the audio meter like a white meter going up yeah how far all right oh there you go there you go so how's the volume here how's the volume there it's too much yeah check check mic check one two one two check check check camera sounds good so do you wanna because well so what you can do is I guess you can see them right now yeah yeah thank you Chris is going to be sealing in the middle you know however we have a different purpose sweeter so Matt is going to sit right there yeah okay now let's do the camera settings um do all the 1080 and everything yeah thank you thank you [Music] all right I'll bring this back up to the cards okay I'll put the car back in the wage thank you conversation thank you competitive ideas are you guys are welcome to being here um definitely sorry foreign a week Monday yeah so next week Thursday yeah start [Music] the game license applications starts for real like we're like basically just reviewing an issue it might seems forever generator sales right right but you know it's sad because I'd say like a year from now a year and a half Generations we try to save the focus on the mission is very clear and so there's a lot of noise around the world building constantly but like the last answer so it's going to be the same sort of fireplace and the next number of Genius it's working it's just not working the way everybody yeah foreign you guys but then like maybe incentives also like um like there's risks with going first the question wasn't figured out yet and yeah a lot of them so it wouldn't either yeah this is they understand 
how do you think thank you thank you I'm okay because I move around so that's fine where's Jake thank you okay folks um I don't think I you need reminders right you know the project is due on Monday I mean the old days I don't know whether this guy is still around Times Square there used to be this I was going to say crazy guy but that's the rule rather than the exception in Times Square this guy within kemped hair and every time you walk by it a Bible is an endlessly or repent repent I feel like doing that with each of you the end is near repent repent no but I think you're ready for the end so the end is coming right the project is getting due so not your life stand right so don't worry I'm not trying to plan to kill all of you or something on on Monday but your project is due on Monday so a couple of things about the project I want to kind of talk about one is as you start putting the project together you work with the page constraint you realize that right does that remind me again what your page constraint is let's see how many of you actually read that section you didn't know there was a page constraint there is a page constraint right don't spend more than four or five pages on an individual company which is a challenge if you're a boss person you want to explain to me every single detail of your discounted cash flow evaluation here's what's not going to work if you say look this is how I got my Beta I started with the unleavened beta then I look for the debt to equity ratio then I multiply I know how to get to 11 but I will assume you know as well so here's my suggestion if you want to summarize your discounted cash flow evaluation I know different reports have done it differently probably the most effective way of summarizing what your entire DCF is doing is to actually take a picture of the story worksheet in your discounted cash flow spreadsheet everything's in there right I know your growth rate on your margin I know your story you can enrich it if you want by adding things but it's the one repository for everything you've done and it'll save you three pages of writing and it'll do it much more effectively because it'll Tie Your Story to your numbers and say this is why I'm assuming growth so take a picture my only plea to you is remember with my eyes I can't see really small things so if you take a picture and you shrink it to a quarter of a page I would see it as something there but beyond that I'll not know what's in it so if you take a picture at least make it fill a page so I can see what you've assumed so it's going to save you for your discount cash flow evaluation that's effectively your DCF that short I don't want your worksheets I don't need your worksheets I don't want to see your worksheets I don't want five attached worksheets a spreadsheet so basically don't send me the spreadsheets I have zero interest in them the time for that has come and gone right that was what the feedback was so now at this stage all I care about is your summary on the pricing keep it compact tell me your sample tell me a multiple tell me what you found and don't forget to make your recommendation buy sell or hold right I think it's easily fittable in three pages I think adding an extra page gives you buffer so you know do what you need to do but uh send in one report per group Monday PDF file and we go there just check hey come on so that's the project part any questions in the project 5 p.m on Monday right that's a dude dude let's talk about the last pieces of valuation today I'm going to complete the discussion of Acquisitions remember I was trying to sell you a company that was worth only 60 minutes trying to get you paid more than 60 mil you're being very resistant I try to get to use your cost of equity and saying that pushes up value and said no then I tried to convince you that you had a lot of cheap debt and that could do it and he said no I try to attach a 20 control premium and he said no and then I tried to throw the magic word Synergy and you still said no so today I'm going to keep trying to get you to pay more than 60 million but after I do that we're going to turn our attention to how do you change the value of a company it's a very different conversation right up till now what's the question we're answering how do you estimate the value of a company and if you're an investor that's all you care about but I want to ask how do you change why do we care about the answer to that who or who cares about the answer to that how do I change the value of a company our Founders owners business so basically anybody within the business this is your job right and if you're an owner this is your value how do you change it if you think about Consulting especially the top of the end Consulting it's really about going to companies and trying to convince them that they want these are the things you do to enhance that but I want to draw a contrast between value enhancement and price enhancement and given the discussion we've had about value and price you can already see where that's got so here's the test let's suppose I came to you with a series of actions each one I want you to tell me whether there'll be a value effect first so think cash flow is growth and risk and then I'm going to ask you a follow question could it have a price effect you know what a stock split is what happens to the stock split deep you basically take every share holiday or one share I give you four shares instead right what does a stock split do to my value of the company it doesn't change right cash flows growth and risk but could it affect the price why what what are the reasons the stock split could affect the price well that'll always happen right but so why is that good or bad I thought that was bad right to have more shares outstanding by itself use usually viewed as a bad thing to have more shares what is it about a stock split that might make you push up the price per share of the company zero price right and but everybody gets it everybody gets it nobody gets it that's the problem right if you are the only one getting a stock and I got an extra share it's a freebie but if everybody gets it that's worth nothing could it make you more optimistic about the company's future yeah no no other Amazon hit two thousand dollars per share right does it ten for one two things or accomplish the stock plate one is the price per share drops to about 200 why is that good because there are people who might not have been able to buy a 2000 so maybe that there's a demand effect remember prices demand and Supply so there are investors who might buy your shares because they're cheaper they're no even though they're not technically cheaper but they're because they're more units it's easier to buy shares the second is there's a signal a company that expects its stock price to decrease in the future at least that's the way your story plays in your head is not going to split it talk so you're saying you know what stock splitments mean that they're optimistic about the future there's a pricing effect there's no value effect pricing effect how about the amortization of good and first what is this amortization of Goodwood crap that we read about what does that mean Sofia what is what is it so who makes that judgment also you hire Deloitte or an Ernst and Young they land in your company and say guys you paid too much on what that daily did three years ago so we're going to write off a billionaire that's amortization this is terrible right you're writing that's a big loss will it have a value effect let's suppose The Company You Picked has amortizes 2 billion in Goodwood tomorrow does it change your value per share yes unless you read that say oh my God I thought this company was a great acquiring company and I've seen but remember accountants are reflecting mistakes that everybody knows you made two three years ago by the time it happens it's old news your values aren't affected by somebody amortizing a mistake it's a sunk cost it's a mistake in the past do you think there's a pricing effect when a company announces a seven billion dollar no at first reaction that's a big loss you know what markets are incredibly perceptive when it comes to Goodwill amortization the price effect of amortizing Goodwill is zero which makes you wonder why do we pay all these accountants all this much money to come in and tell us things that everybody seems knows but that that you know that horses left the barn you know too many people are making money rewriting writing Goodwill but it's a useless exercise don't tell that so you go to work for Deloitte and they put you in charges don't tell your managing director why are we doing this useless exercise it's paying your salary just do the useless exercise move on but remember nobody cares okay what about changing depreciation you know what when you tell your depreciation methods it can affect your income especially if you go from accelerated depreciation to straight line depreciation let's say you do it only in your reporting books you know in the US that's legal to do change what effect does that have on evaluation what do you do in valuations you start with earnings right and now I'm going to report higher earnings you think this is good but then what do I do I add back depreciation the cash flow effect is zero right but could it affect pricing what do people react to What do what's a big you know bottom line numbers in every earnings report in the Wall Street Journal runs the next day what do they look at earnings per share right so I change depreciation methods my earnings per share pop seven cents there's going to be some lazy Trader out there saying this is an amazing company I'm going to buy 10 000 more shares of it it's a pricing effect okay you know what tracking stock is very common the late 90s New York Times today they took a segment of the company it stayed part of the New York Times but they allowed people to buy shares in that segment he's saying why would you do that that segment was called newyorktimes.com you see what they were trying to take advantage of right peakofthe.com boom people were paying big prices they effectively said this part of the company's New York times.com you can buy shares still same company still same cash flows but will there be a pricing effect of course there will be what do you think would happen if tomorrow Microsoft issued tracking stock on chat GPT you think people would buy it I think you could make tens of billions of dollars via Microsoft from doing it simply because people think hey that's a fad word in general there are things can that can change prices but I have no effects on that could changing your name as a company effective value as a company we'll talk about that right you say why would that you're going to see that it can be a pricing effect having a different name for a company can have a pricing effect so one of the things we're going to start with a question so when CEO says I want to enhance my company's value I'm going to stop and say are you sure you want to enhance your company's value or do you want to enhance your company's price because a set of recommendations I'm going to make on what you need to do are going to be very different value enhancement was just pricing it but let's focus on value enhancement you've risen up the ranks you've now become the newly anointed CEO of a multi-business company I've been very creative in naming the businesses they're called a b c and d okay you can see the very very different businesses I've completed the return capital and cost to Capital each business you ready you're going to divest one of these businesses which of these businesses would you pick to divest sounds like a slam dunk go for it because I'm just waiting for you on the other side okay which is the odd which looks like the outlier it looks like a terrible business and what are we taught in in business school get rid of the terrible business right what is the effect of divesting a business so think about the value of your Equity as a company when you divest something what is the effect on your value of a divestiture what happens in Universe something you something leaves your company what do you get in return what somebody pays for the company right you know the effect of a divestiture is it's a difference between what the value of what you divested and what the price of a data value and what are you investing your crappy business right does everybody know it's crappy yeah kind of so when you try to sell this business what kind of a price do you get a crappy price a crappy price might not be better than a crappy value this sounds counterintuitive but if you're looking for business so you can increase value it's businesses where the price is much higher than the value you know what kinds of which divisions are going to be most likely to be those businesses that get too high a price it's your best businesses it's a businesses we have the most potential where there's a greatest growth it it's counterintuitive because that's not what companies do but maybe after a new CEO comes in rather than get rid of your worst businesses should be trying to sell your best businesses for the highest price you can come back and try to fix or do whatever you can with the worst businesses but value enhancement is tricky because you have to think about what the effect is not just to what you're selling but what you get in return one final question this I think is company that is back in there when I wrote this this question the answer I expected was very different than the answer I might get today this is about eight years ago Google is the peak of its Glory the heart of the fangam stocks having doubled in market cap company with great returns 60 billion dollar cash balance Google decides to return 45 billion in BuyBacks will you as a shareholder in Google be better off or worse off when it returns that cash but does that depend on well value cash is Cash unless what you don't trust the manager of the company so in 2015 the question is do you trust Google's management the answer would probably have been almost University of course I do company 11 years has gone from being nothing to a half a trillion dollar company do you think if I asked that question today there might be a little more shakiness you notice a lot more negative stories about Google push how many great Investments has Google made beyond that first search box I've always wondered they called themselves alphabet right they claim to be in what eight businesses but it's really snow or Snow White in the Seven Dwarfs right there's a search box that's 94 of everything they do and the Seven Dwarfs all lose a ton of money and account for the remaining six percent nothing that Google has done outside of the search box has made the money in 2015 people said it's coming any day it's coming any day at some point in time so maybe it's not coming and on top of that they've completely screwed up for whatever reason at least from the outside this AI thing right they've let Microsoft become somehow the winner of this game it's too early to make winners and losers I'll wager today that if Google did a buyback the stock price would pop because people I think have lost stress it can happen over short periods Facebook in fact did a buyback precisely for this for this reason people don't trust Facebook anymore so as we talk about value enhancement we're in a sense going to revisit those Corporate Finance questions about dividend policy and investments in capital structure so let's turn back to where we were in the acquisition section remember I was trying to sell you this target company right do you remember the base value 60 million I try to get you to pay 100 million using your cost of equity and you said no then I try to convince you that if you use debt the cheap debt in debt capacity and you cost the capital go down you said no try to add 20 premium for control and you said no and it's Synergy and he said no there's no Synergy so now I'm getting desperate so here I say if I look let's forget this intrinsic value stuff it's not working for us you want to acquire company you got to pay a reasonable price I'm going to price the target company and how do we price companies we find comparables we take a multiple and we come up with the pricing and that's what I'm going to do I'm going to find comparables but rather than look at all companies I'm going to look at what are called transaction multiples what transaction multiples are you look at only companies that have done Acquisitions you look at the prices paid in Acquisitions I want to think about whether that might create some kind of a bias in this process so that's my peer group and then I get to try different multiples and I pick the one that works for me best which is the multiple that gives out so I said look there are people out there who are paid five times that but that's what the transaction multiple said that's what you need to do to get a transaction done is pay five times 20 million which is 100 million in fact in fact if you block I'm willing to make it five times future ebit as if that makes a problem go away but the big number is five right which I got from looking at a pure group of transaction multiples hold on to the thought you're saying what's wrong with pricing nothing wrong but the question you've got to ask is is this good pricing is this a buyer step and I notice you're still a little uncomfortable and I said no no you got to remember this deal is an accretive deal Bankers love that word you know what a Creator means what does a creative mean anybody you know look where he said it increases earnings per it's as simple as that here's how it goes from increasing earnings per share to increase prices let's say you have a company trading at 20 times earnings right the earnings per share is two dollars you have an accretive deal what happens to earnings per share it goes from two dollars to two dollars and ten cents you can see the logic then right 20 times 210 is five percent higher a creative deal so there is this notion among Bankers that creative deals are good deals dilutive deals are bad deals one of the most absurd Notions you can think of we're going to talk about the mathematics that makes a deal accretive and you very quickly go to see it that can't be right so let's take these two things separately let's start with the pricing question statistics where take samples all the time right but once what's a one cardinal rule in statistics that you're not allowed to break when you sample you cannot create a bias sample I'll give you an example of a bias sample you know the coronation is coming up right you're all keeping track of it in your calendar you know what I'm talking about King Charles is going to finally become king I've been waiting for this moment for like 30 years every day so please God make King Charles it's coming right and it's going to be a TV show all day so let's suppose you wait for the coronation and then you sample people who watch the entire coronation this is like eight hours of watching the king walk in slow motion and then you know all the and then you ask them what did they think about the monarchy what do you think the answer is going to be if you pick the people who watch eight hours of the coronation say what do you think of British royalty this is the most amazing thing to ever walk the face of the Earth 99 approval why because you got a sampling bias I don't think any of the people in this room if you're the exception don't put up your hand I don't think you want to self-reveal yourself is planning to watch an eight-hour coronation that requires a very special special is a good word here a very different mindset to be able to do that sampling bias the problem with transaction multiples is a sampling wire so if you want to price a Target company what should you do do it honestly which means do the pricing the way we always to sample across all software companies not just ones that but targets of Acquisitions that's a much cleaner pricing and as for a creative how does a deal become a creative what what do you have to do in terms of math your company the p e ratio of 20. what has to be true about the p e ratio of the target company for you for the deal to be a Creator lower or higher than 20. it's got to be lower than 20. if you buy any company the PE Ratio lower than yours your earnings per share will go up if you use debt to do an acquisition your earnings per share will go up so you're telling me any debt driven acquisition of a company with a lower p ratio than mine is a good deal that doesn't make any sense in fact why do companies have lower PE ratios than mine they have lower growth and higher risk right when I acquire them guess what I do to my own PE ratio I'm going to bring it down so even though my earnings per share might be higher after the deal there's no guarantee the price will be higher in fact McKinsey showed that a creative deals actually deliver lower value for shareholders and diluted dates if I had my druthers I would retire both words from the m a language no talk of a creative and delusive in this room because it basically distracts you from looking at what you're paying so don't be a lemming just because everybody's paying five times debit doesn't make it okay for you to pay it and moving it to your five or year 10 doesn't make the sin go away and remove the words of credibility there's no indicator indication you're going to get by looking at the deal secretion or dilution to get a sense of it's a good deal or not so at this stage I'm at a dead end right you're not refusing to pay a premium I've tried everything I can so I hit you with what I think is my trump card nothing political in that statement trump card has another no so I'm not making any statements about politics here's my trump card I say you got you're being very difficult I'm talking to you right across the table so I've been trying to sell you the company you keep saying no and no and no do you know your CEO really wants to get this deal done you know what I'm trying to say is most deals originate at the top and percolate down which means that the CEO really wants to get the deal done I'm just going to go over your head and the deal is going to get done and the other argument I can make is there are other companies in this business who are doing deals and if you don't do these they're called Defensive deals everybody else is doing a deal if you don't do a deal you're going to fall behind everybody's buying an AI product I mean Banks this is a big deal everybody's investing in fintech you've got to invest too even though you're overpaying by massive amounts so I think is that justification CEO wants to do it or if the deal everybody else is doing obviously not but it's actually one of the most difficult pushbacks you're going to have do you know that when you look at companies and you look at the premium Spade on acquisitions that the premiums paid on Acquisitions are correlated with the size of the CEO's ego I'm not making there's actually a study that did this you know how the heck did they measure an ego didn't hire psychologists to go in they actually looked at the number of press mentions of a CEO's name and they said the more times your name is Jamie Diamond must have an ego the size of a I don't know the universe right I mean think of how often you see Jamie Diamond Jamie Diamond Jamie Diamond right so they looked at the correlation they said bigger the ego the larger the premium and that doesn't surprise me in behavioral Finance you know there was deadly quality that you bring into investing in a businesses it's overconfidence what is overconfidence you think you can do things you really cannot do these are the people in high school who really used to piss you off right they knew very little but they acted like they knew it all these are the people who will rise up the ranks to become CEOs trust me because that Bluster is going to overwhelm everything along the way so you get overconfident people rising the top what does it mean when you're overconfident you look at a Target company you pay a thirty percent premium percentage I can pull it off that's what our confidence is you think you can do things that really cannot be done you know that overconfident CEOs are the constant when you look at companies doing Acquisitions it's not that company the as the CEO moves around from company to company the Acquisitions go with the CEO it's the person not the company that is acquisition driven so what do you do if you have an all-confidence CEO try to sell them as much stuff as possible pursue this ego be like the Japanese I'm nothing you're everything except to negotiate it's amazing right Japanese basically I I didn't you are so great it's a great strategy because it feeds into the ego I am so great I can pay 80 premiums you collect the premium and then you go back home and you tell your wife look that stupid guy had told him he was the greatest yeah I don't think much about it great negotiating strategy played to the ego and it's for defensive deals let's suppose I told you're in a business where the only way you survive is by overpaying for companies let's be responsible I don't want to survive why is survival so critical if the only way you can survive in the airline business is by throwing money into the ground and it never comes out maybe you shouldn't be an airline just sell yourself to that big ego CEO the other Airline and walk away there's no there's no glory in survival for the sake of survival there shouldn't be which is one reason I will avoid anybody who has sustainability in their name or any class with the word sustainability as part of its title sustainable what I know it's a big word now in business everybody wants to be sustainable I understand sustainability at the planet level right we want the what does it mean when you say I want to sustain a company why you want to sustain Bed Bath and Beyond I don't right what about GE it's a dead man walking Let It Go Right so when you look at those those those reasons for Acquisitions they don't work hard and fine let's talk about the accountability Factor you all heard of HP right Hewlett Packard legendary company you know that Venture Capital as we know it in the U.S was born with HP the first company that draw Adventure caps been around it builds silicon bad Hewlett and Packard built their first computers in the garage garages are big in Silicon Valley Steve Jobs garage maybe they shouldn't build houses just build garages all over Silicon Valley they seem to be more productive no research Labs just garages right but it's a company Silicon Valley and what was its primary product through its glorious what made HP a great company what did it make that's in that down days printers are when they hit the dead end they made computers they made computers more you know the IBM did the big Mainframe HP did the smaller computers and then the PC business effectively killed them so by the time you get to 200304 the printers are the only thing keeping them alive right certainly not even printers we know how printer companies make money it's with the ink they have to it's like Gillette right the Razer model basically put the give the razor away for free then charge fifteen dollars a blade and HP was still ambitious they want they thought of themselves as a great technology company so they kept trying to reinvent themselves by doing right by doing big acquisitions spend 10 billion in an acquisition then three years later they dried off to 8 billion so they did this you know over and over again and this was actually an acquisition they did of a company called autonomy it's a British software Services Company HP actually paid 11.1 billion dollars for the company and I wanted to see where that 11 Point win 1 billion so I built up to that value I started with the book Equity of the company which is accounting numbers we know but in in this case autonomy actually hired I'm not Deloitte to come in and write up the book value what does that mean they come in and they look at their existing assets they do a little dance and say that's what three times more but that written up value that they came up with was 4.6 billion so think of that as the fair value of assets in place according to accountants the market value is 5.9 billion so each step you're adding an extra value that the extra 1.3 billion maybe that's for growth assets so far so far the differences are one billion two billion and then HP comes in an office 5.2 billion on top of this why they claim that there was Synergy and control and they paid the premium acquisition gets done at the time that they did this everyone else in the business was flabbergasted at how much they paid they thought they'd paid too much so Leo apotheco was the CEO of HP New York an equity research conference is asked to defend it I'm going to read what he said word for word because I can't keep a straight face so I'm going to turn my face this way so you don't see what the look on my face is this is Leo talking to the equity research artist so why'd you pay so much he says the face of almost Universal feeling is what Leo says we have a pretty rigorous approach inside HP that we follow for all our Acquisitions which is a d dot C dot f slash based model as I said I'll repeat you know the very fact he says A D dot C dot f slash base model tells me he's never actually done at DCM there's what is a d dot C what based what is that base doing I'm not sure you know and then the the the the journalists to show you that they know nothing about DCF decides to fill in the rest it's in reference to a discounted cash flow evaluations the journalists expanding our d dot C dot is look I know what d and c and f stand for good a standard valuation methodology and here's Leo again and we try to take a very conservative view Leo should have stopped right there because he kept going so let's see what Leo said next he said just to make sure everybody understands autonomy will be on day one creative that man I'm okay now it's in a creative deal right just take it from us we did that analysis at Great length in great detail so it's two grades already and we feel we've had a very fair price for autonomy and we'll give a great return third grade comes in I wish I could end the story here one year later that 11.1 billion that HP paid for autonomy got written down to 2.3 billion it was an 8.8 billion dollar mistake and I decided when you make an 8.8 billion dollar mistake I want to hold people accountable so I'm going to take the 8.8 billion and I'm going to assign blame to different groups the first group I'm going to blame are the people actually did the deal that big merger expectation so leopard should not just be fired but you need to claw back every dollar you paid him over its lifetime and if he can't sell his house Liquidators investment Holdings take back the lease car get it all back before you feel too sorry for him you know it's a big mistake right you make a hundred thousand dollar mistake you get fired this guy's made it but four billion dollar mistake and if I can I'd also like to deal in all those deal makers I think it was Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley I want my money back right what kind of deal advice is this that's the first stop so that's 4.4 billion of the mistake 1.7 billion HP claimed that the accountants at autonomy had played accounting games it turned out that they had played some accounting games so I said that's about 1.7 billion and I'd like to get that money back from Deloitte because they were the ones who did the accounting acts so deloitte's going to pay me 1.7 billion Goldman's going to pay me about a billion or paid not me but the shareholders in HP and finally I also said you know what the remaining this they actually took a comp the autonomy and made it a worse company in HP so I said the CEO followed leopard and and the current management and its Auditors are responsible for the remaining Mark 8.8 billion is signed across different groups you know how many of these groups actually ended up being held accountable for this not how the heck do you get away with this how do you make an 8.8 billion dollar mistake and nobody seems to be responsible it might explain why we have so many bad deals is the deal gets pushed through and nobody gets held responsible all those forecasts and claims made at the type of the deal so lots of negative stuff and Acquisitions right so you think is there any hope I have to go work in m a you know it sounds like you know I'm going to go work in hell and you probably are but I'll give you a few cool spaces in hell you know when it gets really hot you can go in here so think of this as a hopeful end to this process so with each one I'm going to ask you so your job you work in m a and you're saying I want to create value you're still one of the last people left in this space wants to create value here are your choices do you want to be a soul bidder or be a part of a bidding war which probably gives you greater chance it's all better right I'll show you the evidence on what do you want to go after public targets or private targets tell me why what is it about public targets it makes acquisition so much more difficult you got to pay market Price Plus right market price God only knows what where is it private businesses you start the value you estimated you know what's in there so you can say I can pay a premium for that you do prefer to pay with cash or pay with shares it's a tough one what do you think should depend on well what do you think about your own shares is he acquiring company if you think of overpriced shares you'd like to pay with them right but here's a the gaming system that happens let's suppose you decide to pay with shares and I'm a Target company shareholder I can observe what you did right you pick shares what do I read into that that guy must think his shares are overpriced so what do I do I push up the premium this I mean this is Game Theory at its best right because you effectively see both sides playing this game you're probably going to pay a larger premium when you pay with shares the net effect is going to determine whether this is good so let's see if that varies across companies would you prefer to go off to small targets or big targets merges of equals emerges of unequals where your chance is greater of creating value what happens when 200 billion dollar companies come together everybody's happy the day after they do dances they're good friends it's like two separate entities continue to exist for five years because they have their own cultures and Daimler but Chrysler I remember thinking how is this going to work you have the quintessential German company buying a U.S automobile you can see the culture War coming it took them five years to say this is you know like a wedding that should never have happened a divorce that's long overdue but you could see with big companies and finally would you go for cost synergies or growth synergies where do you think your odds are better yes and why is that or it could be some other guy you said a distribution set it and you have plans you can easier to make plans because it's concrete it's like this is what I'm going to do let's say this is in fact True by looking at the actual evidence this is a academic chart how do can you tell it's comes out of a paper it's kind of a primitive chart right it looks like a pre-excel chart no colors no no very difficult to read but no it actually tells a story it looks sad two bidders in a bidding war I'll tell you this I I'll get I'll take the suspense of the story one of these guys wins the bidding war one loses a bidding war this is what happens the stock prices of the two companies so day Zero is when the winning or losing happens so that's a day in which you decide who the winner is and this is the stock price after one of these is the winners stock price and one of these is the losers stock price which one of those two do you think is the winner of the bidding war one obviously the stock price goes up after the event one the stock price goes down which do you think is the one that won the bidding war the one that went down is the winner of the bidding war why is that why I mean losing ability War the next day you get this headline so and so company loses bidding war right your ego is really damaged but what did you say so the bidding was you've been 70 I've been 75 you've been 80. I've been it's like eBay right 85 then you bet 90 and I drop out you won you know what when you win an auction you should always have mixed feelings part of it says I won you know what the other part of you say why did everybody else look at you and laugh because they said he's paying too much right the definition of winning an auctions everybody else thinks you're paying too much the winner of the bidding war ends up winning but then has to pay 90 dollars per share for the remaining shares including the loser shares that's kind of a bonus you get right so the shares you accumulated during the bidding war you sell to the winners saying you know what give me the 90 dollars so if you ever have a shareholders in a company it's not under bidding war every night before you go to bed pray please God let my side loose because if you look at the price change it's much better but better still if you're in a bidding war you know what you should do right just drop out let people fight against each other pay the high price there's no winning a bidding war if you think from a perspective of your shareholders this graph is kind of tough to read so let me go through why you have these four different colors so basically they're based on the size of the target firm so the blue are smallest companies relative to less than six percent of their value the purple are large so small to large targets and I look at Cash stock combination of cash and stock so let's start with the all first if you look at small versus large you see where the winning is right you're far more likely to win with small targets than with much bigger targets the bigger the target the more likely you're going to lose cash in stock you get this strange bifurcation with when you look at cash offers with large deals cash is actually a much better way of paying for large deals stock turns out to be a much more attractive option with smaller deals why do you think that is remember the gaming problem which you have a trillion dollar company if you're a 10 million billion dollar company in a trillion dollar two trillion dollar company offers shares you're not doing any gaming you're small they're big you just take the shares but if I'm a hundred billion dollar company and I'm trying to buy you an era 100 billion dollar company now you worry more about is the share correctly priced so the way I read this graph is if you're doing big deals you're better off doing cash deals and you're doing small deals maybe you can get away with using shares especially if they're overpriced finally let's look at public versus private Acquisitions so the blue is public and again I'm looking at small to large yields across every size class public deals are by far the worst way now the worst set of targets right you get then even on really small dates where you have a chance of making money they make less money than the other so buying a private business generally tends to deliver higher returns in buying a public business but there's a third way of growing which actually is even better than buying private businesses it's buying divisions of public companies why do you think that works so well remember the the example I showed at the start four divisions what are we all trained to do get rid of the worst business at what price it doesn't matter give it away for free board in 2009 classified Jaguar Land Rover as their wasp lists so in Tata Motors approached them they essentially gave it away Jaguar Land Rover has saved automotives over the last decade and they effectively got it for free you're in effect taking advantage of the fact that when new management comes into a company the first thing they try to get rid of with the old person's mistakes they want to make their own right get it all and they will give it away because they want to get rid of them so if you're going to craft an acquisition strategy you can already see targeting private businesses or divisions of public companies gives you better odds nothing is guaranteed better odds than going up to public companies finally this is from a McKinsey study that looks at how often companies deliver on promise Synergy so let's start with cost synergies right there were 92 companies in their sample and 61 of them delivered a hundred percent or more of the cost synergies that were promised I didn't promise 50 million they delivered 50 million often more than that that's a pretty high percentage of companies that deliver most to the if in contrast when you look at growth synergies out of the 77 companies only 17 delivered growth synergies that were 100 or greater so less than one I mean but one in five companies delivers a hundred percent of growth synergies almost 60 percent of companies with cost synergies deliver on their promises so if you are in charge of thinking about Synergy I mean the rules are very simple go after cost synergies rather than growth synergies if you're going after cost synergies make sure there are plans in place before you do the acquisition because afterwards it's too late right you're overpaid already you can't get the money back and most important hold somebody accountable for delivering on those synergies otherwise they will never be delivered so is there a way to grow through Acquisitions and add value yes but it's a very narrow path right it's a narrow path where you've got to be disciplined you're going to focus on small companies private businesses make sure you pay a price that's less than the value and perhaps you can succeed in already you can see why it almost comes with the time step you cannot keep doing this because as you get bigger it's going to get more difficult to carry through why is that a really small company one acquisition might be a 20 growth rate when you become 10 times as large you might have to do 10 Acquisitions to get the same growth rate you're going to run out of good targets you're going to end up becoming undisciplined I mean I remember in 99 Harvard Business School wrote a case study about how a company can grow through acquisitions they talked about an amazing company that over a decade had grown its market cap from 4 billion to 400 billion just by doing acquisitions you know the company they picked 90-99 grew a hundred fall through Acquisitions we talked a little bit about it Cisco the company that grew with acquisite I mean they did 15 Acquisitions a year in Harvard Business School wrote of cases this is how you can grow with Acquisitions and that's usually a Death Note for a company when Harvard Business School writes a case about how well you're doing because they're almost like they got the timing exactly right between 2000 and 2010 Cisco did exactly what they did between 1919-99 you know what happened to market cap it went from 400 billion down to 100 billion he's saying what happened the company got too big and almost by definition you're too big and you continue to do Acquisitions your Acquisitions have to get bigger they've got to become larger number and it caught up with them I have never seen a company consistently be able to grow with Acquisitions over long periods I can point to lots of companies that have been able to consistently grow with Organic Investments talk about the coca-colas of the world the ibms of the world in the last century you can talk about the technology apple and Microsoft for the most part have gone through internal Investments once in a while they might do an acquisition Microsoft did buy LinkedIn in but 2013. but for the most part great companies grow with Organic growth internal Investments growth or Acquisitions is an exception so when a company says we're growing with Acquisitions we can create value my first reaction is hey given the history of Acquisitions tell me why your special Marcos has a company which grows only through acquisitions has a one and a half percent return on Capital in its Acquisitions and just says just wait good things are going to happen been waiting almost a decade nothing good is happening at some point you say maybe nothing good will happen here because you've overpaid on this acquisitions so any questions on Acquisitions so I've talked you out of working in m a hopefully you know but you know that's your choice to make map out your own path okay let's talk about changing value we talked about value enhancement this is price enhancement I'm going to show you two of my favorite studies of all time kind of fun studies first was done in the late 90s and it looked I think at 64 companies that changed their name and they changed their name in a very specific way what was happening in the late 90s the.com boom you know how these companies change their name they added.com to their names and there was another condition and they changed nothing about their businesses should things like steals a company that made steer work with steel scrap call themselves steelscrap.com say what what's the.com doing in there there's a reason they did it right you know peak of the.com Boom look at what happens on average these are many of them are small companies on average changing your name by adding.com makes your stock price jump 150 I think we've been wasting our time in this class talking about cash flows growth and risk maybe we should be going through names what's a good name for a company I think AI slipped in is a good name right Olive Garden AI but breadsticks come artificial intelligence nobody has any idea what it means but the AI alone might add a 20 premium it makes no sense from a fundamental perspective but the pricing can reflect you see why don't we play this game the only problem is if you play this game what the market gives the market takes away so here's the second study so about three years later.com boom is bust these companies also change their names you know what they did they removed.com from their names and when they did that the stock price pops again thank God you're not a.com company you live by the market you're going to die by the market so you pick something AI right now might be a good thing 10 years from now who knows what AI will deliver I know very little about what pricing can do to your company it's based on fads and moods and momentum so let's talk about changing value and by now we have all the mechanisms we need to think about that right to change the value of a company you have to change something that matters and the only four things that drive value of a company cash flows from existing assets so maybe you can find a way to get more cash flows from existing ads we'll talk about some of the most common you can try to increase the value from growth by doing what are the two ways you can increase value from growth one is if you're a high growth company that's reinvesting too little you can reinvest more grow fast and increase value what's the other you're a mature company that's reinvesting too much you can reinvest less and grow slow and become a more valuable company we're going to leave both doors open maybe you can lengthen the growth periods it's so easy in a spreadsheet right how do you lengthen the growth period in a spreadsheet you take the 10 and you make it fifteen fifteen and twenty spreadsheet it's easy but remember to create value you got to earn more than your cost of capital when we talk about lengthening the growth we're talking about how strong your competitive Advantage is what can you do to make them stronger because that lengthens your growth period everything you've done in business school isn't one of those places right your corporate strategy class is right there lengthen the growth that's all I can think of 10 to 15 years that entire corporate strategy class 10 15 12 plays out there and finally you can try to reduce your caustic Apple what's the first thing that comes to mind when I say reduce your caustic Apple change the mix of debt and Equity but I'm going to give you three other ways in which you might be able to reduce your cost of capital that don't require you to change the mix of debt and equity so let's start with the first you walk into a company or CEO you say I want to generate more cash flows from existing assets how do you do this well you've heard those two words in every restructuring cost cutting and more efficient operations assuming you mean what you said you know why I say that because most of the time people can talk to talk companies talk the talk they don't want to walk the walk what I hear is higher margins new companies if you have businesses that are losing money that you never expect to make money shut them down you think why wouldn't somebody have done them already why does Aaron Hicks play for the Yankees still if you don't don't follow baseball you have no idea what I'm talking about this guy hits like a hundred and I mean I could probably go ahead and hit 120 I think I just closed my eyes and swing because the guy who signed him is still the Yankee manager because it's well established in Psychology that taking an action and admitting to a mistake means you put off taking that action you know people wait too long to sell losers in their portfolio you know why because the act of selling the loser is an admission of hey I screwed up so what do you do you cover your eyes I don't see the loser I don't I don't I don't remember buying that 15 years later it's still there I don't see it you could you develop this selective Amnesia where one line just becomes invisible to you so if you can divest businesses that are losing money or shut them down do that the next thing I'm going to say is going to sound mildly unpatriotic but I'm going to say it anyway I have never believed that it should be the objective of any business to maximize taxes paid to the government I can see Bernie Sanders is already looking through the door saying what is he saying again no right but let me cover myself fully within the framework of the law I want to minimize taxes paid right so what can I do to reduce my tea in the ebit times 1 minus t let's think of some of the ways you can do it one is if you can move your income to lower tax Lookouts this sounds mildly legal already you see what does that mean no Google that YouTube is actually Incorporated and registered in Ireland do you know that why because the ad money that comes into YouTube goes into cyberspace it's not like it goes to a physical location s purposes the IRS has been fighting they're saying No this is YouTube is part of Google how come it's not and Google has managed to successfully separate itself but you don't even have to do something as decisive as taking a division and putting it elsewhere right if they are if you're a company in multiple geographies you better transfer pricing you know what transfer pricing is people who work in it claim all kinds of noble intentions the objective of transfer pricing is move your income from higher tax locales to lower tax Lookouts so here's how it works you're a company with German and Irish operations sometimes you do business between within the company like inter-company transactions the German company buys something from its from the Irish subsidiary and you decide transfer pricing you decide the price so in the German subsidiary biasingly Irish subsidiary do you want to set the price higher or lower because remember this will become a cost to one one geography and a revenue to the other you're going to set the price as high as you can because then the Irish subsidiary claims it as Revenue it the overall company level it offsets right there's no effect but you pay less in taxes I know this you know you think this is so unethical I don't listen to this it's fine I mean but it happens all the time there ain't that thousands of people in transfer pricing trying to do that so all you're trying to do is lower the T by lowering the T what do you do you raise the after tax operating income you get a higher cash flow let's keep going we know the math right they take every times one minus t plus depreciation minus cap x minus change in working capital is there something you can do with depreciation maybe you can get your assets written up and get a little more but that's tough to do but it you look at capex the capex we're talking about here is maintenance capex because we're talking about existing assets maybe you can do it a little more efficiently or better still if you have excess capacity you can live off the fat for a while what does that mean when you're projecting out cash flows from existing assets remember you add depreciation and subtract capex you continue to add depreciation it's there but you don't need to do capex every year you've got excess capacity you're trying to pump up the cash flows from existing assets and if your company heavily dependent on working capital managing your working capital better means there's less of a drain in your cash flows so this is your first stop as a CEO can I increase cash flows from existing assets so think in terms of the life cycle where in the life cycle are your companies if your focus is on cash flows and existing assets what kinds of companies will this be your central place to go to increase value young companies mature companies declining companies it's going to be mature companies because this is the stuff you've got to increase value mature companies it's not growth that's creating the values it's so you're saying can I get more cash flows from existing assets stop maybe I can get more value from growth and here it cuts both ways if you're a company which is in a good business near reinvesting too little you think why would we doing that many companies have hurdle rates that are disconnected from their costly Capital their company is a 30 hurdle rates 35 hurdle rates absurd right so how do they come up with these hurdle rates they look at their history we used to make 30 return on our projects we're going to make that 100 right so you see what's going to happen right you're going to take projects until you get to 30 then you stop even though you're costing capital is 12 percent those companies are going to encourage them to reinvest more even if they earn less than 30 it's still higher than your cost of capital so one way you can get more value from growth is to try to get companies that should be reinvesting more to reinvest more either in projects or acquisition depending on where they get that return in capital if you have a company though that's earning less than its cost to Capital and it reinvests huge amounts they're actually to increase value what are you going to do push them to reinvest less you'll have a lower growth rate but have a higher value because you will save more in terms of how much less you reinvest value of growth you can see cuts across the life cycle you can have young growth companies if you're trying to get them to reinvest more and more mature companies we're trying to get them to reinvest less in fact McKinsey you know McKinsey has published his Journal called McKenzie quarterly I think I've talked about this and one of the things they use is their own database they have a they have a very rich database of clients and what they've done over time so McKinsey actually went through different ways of growing and ranked them from best to worst in terms of value created so over history and across all their clients we're going to go from very best way to grow to very worst way to grow let's start at the top looking across all companies new product development had the biggest positive payoff a million dollars invest new product development creates between 1.75 and 2 million dollars in additional value why doesn't every company come up with new products it's also a very skewed distribution a few Big Winners and lots of people who try and never make but if you're given just one way to grow try to come up with a new product it's going to give you the biggest payoff of all the growth strategies second best expanding an existing Market by doing what finding a new use for a product have you heard of this drug called awesome pick I think it's a drug for diabetes that now turns out to be very effective at weight reduction because it makes you so nauseous that you forget you want to eat for the rest of your life seems like an extreme way to lose weight but think of how much bigger that market has now become right so expand existing Market maintaining or growing share in a growing Market why is that easy because the market itself is growing it's more forgiving of your mistakes right it's an advantage that Indian Chinese companies have over European companies European companies have almost no room for air because the market is mature it's growing at two percent a year you make a mistake you lose market share if the market itself is growing twenty twenty five percent a year it becomes easier for you to grow simply because there's no but more buffer built in the system so the first three are all approaches which in general have created value so you can see the and then you get to the bottom of the barrel and these are the two approaches historically that have had the least of a track record in terms of creating value one is competing for share in a stable Market why is it so difficult to create value by competing for sharing and stable marketing how do you get a higher market share in a stable Market you cut prices you get the higher market share a better world expense much lower margins the net effect can be negative as much as positive you get the higher market share but you get lower profits lower values consequence and at the very bottom of the barrel by now you should know what's coming right we spent an entire hour and a half on it it's acquisitions most difficult way to create value historically there are these little Pathways we talked about but it is in general the most difficult way to create growth so those of you valuing companies that grow through Acquisitions you're already climbing a mountain it's a tough way to create value and if they're not disciplined it gets even even more difficult to get them to have that and just to kind of sober you up about growth and its potential for value this is actually a table I updated at the start of every hour look at the percentage of companies that earn more than their cost of capital and the person of companies around less than the cost of capital so the sample size is 40 this is pretty much every publicly traded company in the world let's go down let's go to 69.4 percent of companies globally last year earn less than their cost of capital 31 percent earn more than the cost of capital so it's more the rule than the exception that you have a tough time earning your cost of capital you're saying that's because Miss 2022 that number has never been lower than 60 percent than percent of companies that earn less than the cost of capital so this is more the rule than the exception that companies have a tough time earning their cost to Capital so when you think about growth remember that a lot of companies be better off growing slower rather than faster growing less rather than more because often they're pushing the limits of where they should be growing by taking Investments that cannot generate the cost of capital let's talk about lengthening the growth period I don't teach corporate strategy and thank God for that that class won't last very long but corporate strategy is all about barriers to entry and competitive advantages right so as an outsider looking at potential competitive advantages let's list some of those competitive advantages first is brand name as we talked about brand names you see the power to charge a higher price for the same product if you are a company with a with a brand name nurture it hold on to it because you don't want to let it go if you're a company without a brand name try to find a way to build a brand name works for about 20 of companies eighty percent of companies brand name is not even a choice it's not an option in terms of competitive advantages so let's look at some of the others if you can get legal protection against competition would you take it if the government sounds like a great thing right the all phone companies got legal protection against competition they were regulated monopolies but why do you want to be a monopoly remind me again what's the nice thing about being the owner of a monopoly because everybody hates you right you know how you get back at them you charge 40 more makes you feel so much better about being hated but if you're a regulated Monopoly here it is Everybody Hates they hated the old phone companies so you got ready to charge 40 more but there was a little bit of a roadblock right what did you have to do you had to go in front of a Regulatory Commission that said this year it's three percent this is not a combination everybody hates you you get a three percent price increase I'd rather not be a regulated Monopoly then give me competition every single day so we're going to get legal protection against competition make sure in return you're not giving up pricing part you know what gives patents in the U.S and the pharmaceutical business so much value it's not just that you get legal protection against competition but historically it's also come with almost complete pricing power it pisses up us sometimes when we have to pay you know what the Martin trick Kelly fifteen thousand dollars a dose but if you remove that pricing by the value of patents very quickly drop off third potential competitive Advantage is switching costs but switching costs you want to make the cost of switching into your product as low as possible but once people switch in you want to make the cost of switching out as high as possible Jake what's your phone service at T Verizon camera I want you to stop by the a t store on 8th Street walk in and ask them can I switch to a t you'll have three sales people surround you 15 minutes later you'll come out with an a t phone but then check your contract at all especially the really tiny print they've locked you in through the next three generations probably and who can blame them right if you think about cell service it is going to get commoditized if you did not bind me in I'd go Verizon at t80 spray and basically I'd be switching each month looking at the best deal the only way you keep customers in this business is by creating switching costs and the final potential Advantage you might have as a company is a cost Advantage what does that mean your costs are lower than everybody else's how do you end up with lower costs than everybody else how does a ramco end up with lower costs than everybody else they got in doubt 300 million barrels it's not like the managers worked really hard right they got in doubt and Advantage so sometimes cost advantages come from being in the right place at the right time sometimes cost Advantage is earned how did Walmart get a cost advantage of its competition with economies of scale and I really mean that not as a buzzword but it's the real economies of scale and if you have a cost Advantage there are one of two ways you can take advantage right one is to charge lower prices than everybody else because nobody else can compete with you and take a higher market share the other is charge the same prices as everybody else and walk away with a much bigger profit margin my the so when you think about competitive Advantage you're saying how strong are those competitors can I make them stronger so if you're a CEO of a company what kinds of companies is good this is going to be the focus companies that used to have a brand name where the brand name has started to fade well you might be brought it's like what can I do to give it fresh juice or a company that is historic or is in a business which has become commoditized the semiconductor business increasingly commoditized how did Nvidia stand out they decide to go after a segment of the business where they said we're going to make it about high-end chips and they're betrayed because they caught the Bitcoin boom and now they're hoping to get the AI boom this is where value enhancement can help think about how does it change today let's talk about Costa cap you think about lowering cost to capitalism most people think about changing the mix of debt Network and that remains the option there are three other ways though you can lower the cost to capitalize if you mismatched your debt to your assets you're paying too high a cost to cap you know what I mean by mismatched the debt to your assets using short-term debt to fund long-term assets Euro debt to fund dollar assets you're asking for trouble you're increasing your default risk matching up debt to assets will make your debt less risky less costly lower your cost of capital and there are two ancillary ways you can reduce your cost of capital goes back to a discussion of betas remember we said betas are higher if you have a product Which is less discretionary which is which is so if you can make your product less discretionary you're in effect lowering your beta and your costing Capital how do you do that now one way to think about advertising is what's your entire job of advertising you cannot live you completely fine without it but they want to convince you cannot live without and if it works maybe this is how we should judge advertising agencies beta before beta after it didn't work but it is the same you're fired right because ultimately that's that payoff is going to be a lower beta and the other thing we said drives betas is how much fixed cost you have if you can lower your fixed cost make your cost structure more flexible you lower your debate so I'm going to show you two companies and I'm going to let you play CEO of each of these companies and I want to to tell me what you change the companies first is a German software company called sap competes with Oracle Global software company I'm going to describe the company in very generic terms and I want you to come in a CEO and say what would he change about the company so this is a very well-run company already your task has become more difficult right it's more difficult if you have a bad leader it's easier if you have a badly run company it's a well-run company High margins it's reinvesting about 57 percent of its after tax offered income so that's pretty active and earning a great return on Capital 19.93 percent so it's growing fast it is a company though that is funded almost entirely with Equity because the founding family and the managers tend to be very conservative they've historically avoided debt 99 Equity one percent that the value per share that I get is 106 Euros so your CEO now what's the first and easy fix to make here where you can change value okay I had more debt right you don't need to be a genius and you say how much more well in my corporate finance class I actually compute optimal debt ratios by looking at what happens the cost of capital as I change the mix of debt and Equity so I took my Corporate Finance spreadsheet for optimal Capital which you're welcome to use if you ever want to and computed the cost of capital at every debt ratio what's my objective lowest cost of capital that's a 30 debt they're at one percent debt so the first thing I'm going to do is raise the debt ratio to 30 percent it's a debt ratio they can live with they have solid ratings no I'm not putting them at risk the other thing and this is the subtext to that reinvestment return capital is they've historically at least in 2005 got almost all of their revenues from the U.S and Europe Asia and Latin America were not even on there on their radar maybe maybe and here I know I don't know enough about the business to see if this is plausible if I can get them to reinvest a little bit more in those markets free investment remember they're earning a 19.9 return on Capital well above the cost of capital I'd even be willing to accept a lower return on Capital with a higher reinvestment rate because it's still higher than the cost of capital so different mix of debt and Equity higher higher reinvestment the value per share I get is 126 Euros what was it before 106 Euros right what should I call that difference between the two this is the value of control right you get to run the firm you do things differently that difference is the value control it was difficult here why because the company was well run so I'll give you a contrast this is 2003 a company called Blockbuster now it's easy to laugh about Blockbuster now there's nothing left of it I think there's one Blockbuster store the original one that people go and take snap you know it's on Facebook all the time I think on Instagram you can take pictures don't try to rent a tape there's nothing actually inside the Blockbuster store this is a store it's there's a company that actually did really well in the 1990s so roll up basically it went around the country acquiring small owner privately owned video rental stores and created this giant video rental company and then I know at the peak of its success it got disrupted by two forces one was the original Netflix does anybody remember how the original Netflix worked he mailed you tapes and you mailed it back amazing how primitive we were all in a primitive time then but essentially it was the alternative Blockbuster much cheaper you didn't have the remember Blockbuster 30 percent of the revenues came from late fees which is you just forgot the tape and my kids used to do it all the time the tape would be under the bed nine days later you discover and said it's not worth even returning it'll just buy this damn tape okay Netflix you didn't have that and the other was Walmart and the other kind of I think it was called Red Box where you could for a Dollar rent the 10 most rented movies so disrupted which meant that fewer and fewer people were coming into Blockbuster but Blockbuster did not seem to notice what does that mean they kept opening 25 more stores every year it's almost like autopilot and the way they showed up is that reinvestment rate is 26 the return they're making on those stores is four percent well below the cost of capital the definition of insanity is you keep doing the same thing over and over expecting a different outcome this company effectively is destroying value over time the value per share that I got is five dollars and 13 cents you're hired a CEO of Blockbuster what's the first thing you're going to do the day you walk into your office first eat it Stop opening stores right now in this case reinvest get rid of that team that's in charge of finding the next store location just fire them right on the spot there will be no more stores in fact if I drop the reinvestment rate to zero percent here All Through Time my value per share jumps to 1247. this is this is about as easy a restructured as you can get and in fact if I can shrink the company even better right because if I can get out some of the worst stores I can end up with 14 15 16 per share when you think about value enhancement it's far easier to Blockbuster than an sap simply because the worst manager firm is the more you can fix and walk away with the proceeds so when we when non on Monday after I take your final projects I'm going to bring this control question fully a full circle and talk about how it's useful in the context of hostile Acquisitions boarding and non-voting shares even rallying publicly traded companies so there's a chance of change but make sure you get those numbers in the master list by Sunday preferably by 10 o'clock give me a break I need to pull those numbers create the presentation so give me at least a couple of hours to be able to do it so if you keep putting it off and I would rather have the numbers to not have them so if you don't have them by Sunday night get them Monday morning I'll try to fix them in the presentation but I would like the numbers in that because it's five It's Five Points of your the of your 40 points goes into that just entering the numbers so that's five give me points right make sure you get those numbers in in time I will see you on Monday yeah okay okay foreign okay so you would need at least like 
okay thank you thank you you get the slides I sent folks if you if you haven't checked your email you should have received the slides at about just after 12 30 or so one o'clock so check your email because you need to click on a link to get it downloaded okay so we're almost there 28 sessions right I promised you I would harass you nag you take over your lives and I'm pretty much done taking over your life sometimes so you know what happens after this you get to finally you get the projects returned back to you if you see see everybody in the group the way you get the project back is I'll see see it back to you with everybody CC so if you forgot somebody in your group then you better catch up with them because they won't be on that list right so it uh the sequencing of the grading of the projects I would start with my valuation class because they're graduating second year mbas they need the grades in so I'm going to start with that then I'm going to do my corporate finance class because um some of them are graduating as well and I probably will not get to your projects until Friday Saturday Sunday so and once I get started I'll try to get done final exam of course is on Friday so you know you know the time right two to three fifty I've never understood this NYU fixation of an hour just make it two hours guys no but no I guess the rooms have to get moved so two hours and fifty I'm sorry it's two to three fifty and we have KMC 260 as well so I'll set the seating arrangement for that watch out for it um I'll send you the links to the final exam review sessions because many of you I know have been busy doing the project you haven't turned your attention to final exam and I will have office hours on Thursday just ahead of the final so if you have any last minute questions you can ask me so what I'm going to do today actually is use your project as kind of a launching pad to kind of talk about the entire class so remember at the start of the class I said there are three ways you can put a number on an asset the first is this fanciful notion called intrinsic value which we describe as estimating expected cash flows from your business discounting tobacco risk adjust cash flow but attaching but the reality as you've realized as you start a value company is estimating is probably too strong a word you're probably guessing numbers as you moved along you know 35 growth 30 growth that didn't work let me try 35 growth the ND came up with the DCF ad on your pricing we said we attached a number to a asset based on what other people are paying for similar assets hopefully by now you realize what's similar should come with quotes let's think of how much trouble you're finding exactly companies like yours and controlling for differences perhaps one out of every 10 companies that you're looking at you also had a chance to apply an option pricing model what's the great thing about applying an option pricing model it allows you to touch a premium on your DCF value and everybody likes to pay premiums so very quick summary what's intrinsic valuation all about it's about answering four basic questions about every company I said this at the start of the class might as well Circle back and look at those four questions first question you look at the companies what are your cash flows from your existing assets things you've already done start small start with what you know that's the easiest of the four questions to answer because you can get the answer by looking at the financial statements essentially to Value Assets in place second question I'm going to ask you is what is the value that you're going to add destroy or do nothing with with growth it sounds like a weird way to ask that question and ask you what's your growth rate the reason I frame it as what's a value added destroyed or doing nothing with growth is the good side of growth is pushes up your earnings and your revenues the bad side of growth is you got to reinvest to get that growth the net effect is what drives it right third question I had was how risky is your company notice and ask you what's your beta which I mean don't mistake Twos for end games you don't like betas I don't care use something else replace it but you still need a risk adjusted discount rate that Rift reflects a risk in your operations and in doing all of this you are making an implicit assumption that your companies are going concerned what does that mean going concerned whatever we assuming there is a bad year it bounces back that it's not the end of the world if that happens of course what you're missing is some companies have bad years and never come back it's a failure risk that you got to bring those are the five inputs right so when you value the company those are basically what you're looking for is answers those questions and if you I mean and I kind of force my model on you to make my life easier because the last thing I want to do is spend you know 20 days checking individual spreadsheets but if you want to build your own model the basis for building the model is always there and if you look at my model the driver is a value of five inputs basically your Revenue growth capturing the growth part of the model your profitability capture with a Target operating margin so accept the fact that he might not be making money now a sales to Capital ratio capturing how efficiently you grow so how much are you growing how profitable are you how efficiently do you grow those basically my cash flows the risk gets captured in my risk adjusted discount rate and the failure risk no there's only five inputs you know how many emails I got from people in the last week who told me they did not like the DCF value and my response is it's not my fault because it's one of your inputs that's called you don't you think your DCF value is too low it's you know take a look at your inputs there then I am just a vehicle for delivering your inputs into value ultimately you don't like value it's got to be in one of those inputs that the value is being determined and ultimately when you look at the evaluation all you can do is check for consistency what does consistency mean this is what I call my valuation triangle it has three sides to it growth your margins and your reinvestment and in other words risk also plays in and the efficiency and consistency means that if you're going to put in a high growth rate for your company I'm going to push you on are you reinvesting enough to deliver that growth it's not my job to say your growth is too high you don't I don't like your growth it's your company so you want to use a high growth rate it's entirely your story but make sure you're reinvesting up the growth reinvestment trade-off often to grow faster what you have to do you have to reinvest more what is reinvesting more required that you raise Capital what does that do it dilutes your ownership of companies if you're a founder and you want to go at 50 a year rather than 30 I'm going to say go for it but then I'm going to say by the way if you do that you're probably going to have to raise more Venture Capital money and give up more of your company in the processes I don't like to do that then I'm going to go back to thirty percent growth when you think about the growth margin trade-off most of the time when you go for higher growth you're going to be fighting on margins right because you're cutting prices so when you tell me a story of a company that's growing faster and delivering higher margins the question is what is special about the company what it's going to allow it to do it maybe it's in a market that's changing and it's taking advantage of it or maybe it is compared to barriers to entry that gives it special advantages and on the growth risk trade-off all too often you go for higher growth you have to go into Emerging Markets riskier markets riskier product areas which means you're going to accept a higher discount rate that comes with growth there are very few things in business where you get a slam duck so whenever somebody says if you do this your value will go up the question you've got to ask is what am I missing what is the trade-off that's animating my back so what I'd like to start with is your DCF valuations my disclaimer here is these are your numbers okay I did not so basically I took exactly what your numbers were in some cases they looked strange maybe you were late at night you had an extra zero to your value I said you know what I can't go in and take zeros out because they look strange so for whatever it's what this is what you found about your carpets first did I let you pick your own companies that was a busy that was a pain in the neck right you'd rather that I had to assign you companies think of how many weeks you played Hamlet okay pick this company that company but finally you picked a company and some of you picked the same company and I did not stop you the most valued companies was it was Netflix why because you guys like watching a lot of TV right I mean I told you about no that semester where the top company was Netflix and came Krispy Kreme I mean I could tell you what you were doing but just the companies you were picking late at night it was week four you hadn't picked a company you're eating a Krispy Kreme donut or watching Netflix Krispy Kreme on Netflix right so I don't know what it is about Lululemon every single semester it's in this list what is it about this company right Canadians the only Canadian company you can think of maybe that's it you know how to do something for Canada I'll pick Lulu Le Mans it shows up on that list man you six of your valued menu extraordinarily interesting company to Value I'm going to talk about the value to price divide there which I don't think will ever close and we talk about why with professional sports teams your value can be much lower than the price you can short sell this company as much as you want but it's never going to adjust not at Costco showing up in all three of my classes in the list so clearly Costco has hit the popular people are looking at courses there's some and and I think the reality is Costco is interesting because it's one of the few brick and mortar retail companies that has found a way to not just survive but prosper in the face of the Amazon online some of you I think are just aspirational so while you were watching Netflix you're saying one of these days it's the only way you can bring in Ferrari into the picture quite a few Ferrari evaluations in there yeah and Peloton maybe you were thinking about maybe I should be exercising if they're watching Netflix and Peloton showed up in the list as well now I'm often asked why I allow people to Value the same company right this is a simple reason the value is the same company you think you're going to come up with the same numbers these are the 10 people who valued Netflix to send me their numbers first I mean they all say may of 2023 but you can see you know one I don't know how you move forward in time so maybe that was meant to be five three but I told you no editorializing maybe you've got the time machine you know exactly what's gonna happen yeah so maybe you meant for 30 20 23 or 503 but I've kind of left it as is no that's a price you can see most of you are doing it in last week take a look at the DC advantage are they different absolutely why they're different because you made choices right in fact that difference is not that why I don't think you had it last year I had you know 12 people value Tesla and you should see the Divergence in values on Tesla well people value Coca-Cola there's going to be almost no Divergence tonight and think of why okay it's a story right and if you look at a young company the kind of stories you can tell about Tesla can drains the Spectrum the values are going to reflect so when you see the same company being valued you might the fact the interesting thing is all of you ended up selling it you think what's the significance of the caps this is when I first learned how to text I'm still a very very primitive texter I need all 10 fingers and it's kind of a little and I sent a text to my daughter and she called me and said why are you yelling at me and I said what are you talking about she said everything was in caps I said that's yelling okay okay so maybe the reason I left them in caps is maybe you're yelling a cell rather than saying so maybe this is a strong cell so you know so whatever again as I said I didn't editorialize I left it at what you did but they're old cells there have been times again when dozen people value company they're 10 buys and two cells because people can make different recommendations so you want to see what you found these were your undervalued and over value stocks I'm comparing your DCF value to the price there are 103 undervalued companies and 210 overvalued companies why do you think that is is it because DCF is somehow conservative no this actually this statistic has been it varies across the message this semester for whatever reason you found far more overvalued than undervalued companies your median company is overvalued by about 20 percent and the average is pushed up because you had a few companies that were really really over there so at least in the DCF basis far more overvalued companies and undervalued companies file that away because I'll show you what the pricing statistics look like but at least on a DCF basis a lot of overvalued companies I did look at your most under so I took your companies and this is the list of companies that I think the 15 or 20 most undervalued companies if your company is on the list no then you can tell me the story if you want to but basically I've looked at the percentage change within the price and the value 10 cent was the most undervalued stock actually I own 10 cent I'd love that to be true you know so it's one of those stocks or I'm hoping that this valuation kicks in right and you can it's a it's a it's a it's a bunch it's a it's a very diverse group of companies some young companies some older companies so these were your undervalued companies presumably this is going to show update recommendation and a lot of shouted buys and some subdued buys but they're all biased or at least at least you're being internally considered you found a company to be significantly undervalued you're buying the company these were your most overvalued stocks take a look at the top level your DCF value is there okay first can that happen we had a DC value of zero for your company right or did you change or you pushed it above zero because you didn't like zero okay kind of business the equity in a business be worth nothing I call this the movie pass room remember movie pass the company one of those incredibly stupid business ideas ever concocted they charge 9.99 a month to watch as many movies as you wanted in any theater you wanted you know I'm at cost to New York City now twenty dollars eighteen dollars something like that you pay 9.99 you can go to 10 movies a year when somebody described this idea to me I said are you crazy so the CEO of MoviePass shows up on I think CNBC I hope he never shows up again and he describes the basis for his idea he says the average American goes to one movie a year the average American the ticket in their movies cost there must be a lot of cheap tickets you know in the midwest somewhere average ticket costs eight dollars we make money on the average what's the raw what's the problem with that logic it's not the average American is buying movie passage people like my son who watches one movie every day I mean he works at Disney he claims it's a tax deductible expense he's building and you know so if people are watching 20 movies this is a business idea that should never got off the ground so if you'd asked me to do a discounted cash flow evaluation a movie pass my you know my response is you got to pay me money to invest in this company not the other way around but to show you a contrast between value and price there were Venture capitalists who invested in movie pass at a 2 billion two and a half billion three billion dollar price so when you see the zero basically these are the companies where they really tried I know some of these people because I have like a hundred emails that I've exchanged with them how do I get my value above zero and finally a responses stop trying you've hit a brick wall many of them have debt right AMC shows up twice AMC I mean you know I know it's the batting AMC the problem you run into is the Toyota business is under assault these companies have a lot of debt so the zero value is not that irrational you can have companies with the equities were zero in which case what should you pay for the companies and an intrinsic value word you wouldn't buy these companies so those are your most overback you go below the zeros you get the rest of the track so I think the issues Astra space right is that yours 12 senses right then stock is trading at at least it's within shouting distance but that percentage difference your most overvalued companies would you sell short this entire list don't do it right because it's an intrinsic valuation who knows when people will come to their senses but if you have any of these companies in your portfolio I'd seriously reconsider whether they should stay in your portfolio not making any investment recommendations now this is my 37th semester teaching this class and I've kept track of buy and sell recommendations that come out of the class and this is as much a test of me as it's a test of you as to whether your buy recommendations and cell recommendations make money so what I do is I wait till about five years after the recommendations why because you need time right otherwise you say it's too quick you know so I'm not going to hold you accountable next year but in the year 2027 your class is going to show up there I'm going to take you by recommendations I'm going to track them over five years you're taking cell recommendations and track them and see if your recommendations have some basis to them if they're completely random what should I say the buys and the sale should do roughly the same the good news is in all of the semesters I picked the buys beat the cells but it's not perfect in fact sixty percent of all by recommendations delivered positive Alpha's delivery went up but 45 of cell recommendations also went up so clearly it's not a hundred and zero I buy recommendations do better you know but you should expect that right I'm glad it's not 50 50. because that would be true Randomness in this entire class be an exercise in how much time can you waste delivering randoms and I hope that's not the end the excess returns that I've computed I also broke down by kinds of companies it's greater on small cap and Emerging Market companies and it is on developed Market companies and that again makes sense right because you're not going to find too many undiscovered secrets in apple speaking of Apple I got like a hundred emails from Omaha this weekend that my name somehow came up putting one of the questions so somebody asked Charlie Munger and I don't know why he'd drag my name into the question I don't know the question or what it was about the Apple holding at Berkshire Hathaway because you as you know right now apple is what more than 40 percent of Berkshire Hathaways Holdings this person brings up my name this way I get insulted not him no and he talks so he asked Charlie Munger are you too worried no that Apple has become such a big part of your portfolio and then he throws my name in about concentration that's a good spot my name came up the bad part is Charlie Munger said I was out of my mind so I've been checking into some lunatic asylums over the weekend saying can I check in you know I'm out of my mind but this is a debate worth having how much concentration should you have in a portfolio especially when that concentration is created not by going out and buying because an interesting question to ask to have asked Charlie Monker is would you buy a stock and put party 40 of your money into that stock and the answer is you could have said absolutely not but clearly you're making an exception when you bought a stock and it's gone up and it's become forty percent the question is should we differentiate between a Stockton and there's there's a reason you know you want these winners to stay in your portfolio because you look at the returns that you make on these portfolios of the buys it's usually not that every buyer makes it you got one or two wins 1998 for instance Apple was one of the buyers from this class it would have been an insanely good buy so every time you look at these portfolios and you look at their overall returns a lot of it comes from letting the winners essentially deliver the reports and finally stocks are about undervalued and underpriced did better than stock so this just undervalued Uber asked you to value a company and price your company companies we get the double whammy where both come in as undervalued historically have done better and the reason I said that is often you're you're asked to pick right do you want to do evaluation or do you want to do pricing my answer is why can't I do both no I know over the weekend I actually wrote a couple of posts on banking the first post I wrote because I wanted to understand what makes banking work so it's a very simple banking model and talk about what makes for good Banks and bad Banks yesterday I wrote another pose the reason I kind of did both posts is now I'm going to spend two weeks where I can do a really grading so I wanted to get the poster my second post was about if you're investing in a bag what banks would you invest you think doesn't the first post already answer the question what is the first process what makes for a good bank what makes her a bad Bank what's the second post about what makes for a good investment in a bank on what a good bank's good Investments not necessarily right because what does it depend on what price you pay so in the second post I looked at you know given that there's a pricing for these men if you if you were to pick a bank that is considered the best run Bank in the US what's a reputational story right now which bank JP Morgan right but the problem is everybody else seems to have also bought in the notion JPMorgan trades at 1.53 times Book value among the highest priced it's the third highest price to book ratio the 25 largest banks in the US it's well regarded but it's highly priced the bank that I valued yesterday in the post of any of you are interested in seeing a bank valuation in a little more detail what's a reputation Citigroup has it's a starchy badly run bank right you think why would you invest in astorgy badly run back because it's priced as a star stodgy abysmally run back you traded half of Book value one of the lowest price it is in fact by far the lowest price to book ratio of any of the top money funding so I value the bank but I also price it what does that mean a compared City to the other 24 big Banks to see am I getting a bark why because I want both going for me I want an undervalued bank and an underpriced back I believe in valuation but to make money in valuation what has to happen the price has to adjust value what I'm hoping is the pricing will push people so it's not like I'm a Trader but I want to think like a trade and say maybe they will push the pricing up so don't make it a choice in a value in price get comfortable doing both you can you can pick your preference as to what you feel more comfortable basing your decisions on but it doesn't mean that you don't do the other now briefly I'm going to leave your projects and finish up one loose set that I did not get to in my last class in the last class we talked about changing value at a company what are the four places you can go you can increase cash flows to existing assets try to get more value from growth lengthen your growth period lower your cost account right so if you take a company in fact you can take your DC up and say if somebody else ran my company what would the value be that difference is the value of control the change in value that you can get from you running the company better making better so think of the revenue growth margin reinvestment you would use in this company and the value that comes that's the value control but to be able to do that remember you've got to be able to run the company someone asks you what is the likelihood that you can run the company change the management and that's going to be a function of a bunch of things one is are you in a country where there are restrictions on takeovers the stronger the restrictions the more difficult it is to create change I'm going to ask you whether you're quoting different voting rights so let's say you think Facebook is badly run my response is not much you can do about it because Mark Zuckerberg controls 57 of the Voting Rights your access to funds right you need to take over a company so the questions I'm going to ask to determine whether change can come will depend on the company so over time there there you know when you think about control changing in companies you think about what causes that that change the first is Corporate governance laws do affect change within the US the SEC makes things more difficult less difficult to do this over time it keeps going around in many Emerging Markets 30 years ago you could not change management the system was designed in such a way that corporate governance was dead in the water increasingly even in those countries you see more movement towards stronger corporate governance it's slow but it's there and finally you know if you have an activist investor show up a Carl icanner Blackman do you read that Carl icance companies being targeted in a short sale I don't know whether the word ironic even fits in here but you know it'll be interesting to see how this plays out but there's a reason activist investors play a role in how your company gets pressed even if you're not directly targeted they're very presence increases and likelihood of change across companies and finally anytime you have a hostile acquisition of a company in a sector that acts like a wake-up call to everybody in that sector saying wake up it could happen to you so when you think about likelihood of change that likelihood can shift over time and over the last 20 or 30 years has been a fair amount of research and what kinds of companies are you most likely to see a change in management so let's look at some of the things that have been uncovered first is companies where stock prices have been going down they've done worse in the market are more likely to see change than companies with stock prices have been doing well that makes sense to you it's easier to change management if people are pissed off with you the stock price is done second the structure of the board seems to matter smaller boards composed of Outsiders you're more likely to see change in CEO than if you have a large board where nobody seems to care compositive insiders okay that does make sense boards often remember shareholders don't vote on CEOs the board is the one that actually moves CEOs in and out the structure of the board matters research seems to indicate that ownership structure in your stock matters companies with a lot of institutional investors are more likely to see chain than stocks where companies with a lot of individual investors part of it is just it's easier to get a coalition going when you have institutional investors because you hold fifteen twenty percent of the stock tougher to do that and finally change seems more likely in some Industries than others technology historically has seen less change from the outside than manufacturing For Better or Worse where you're in the life cycle seems to affect whether change costs so with that lead in stock about the expected value of control in fact I'm going to talk about four places where the value of control can help you understand that the first is when you do a hostile acquisition what is the word hostile in hostile acquisition tell you I'm sorry what Jake it's not friendly but you know friendly to who it's actually very friendly to shareholders the target company it's not friendly to the managers in the Target country what's implicit or explicit message you're sending these guys can't walk and chew gum at the same time we're going to replace them and do different things it's essentially a control argument right so I'm going to talk about how that plays out in hostile acquisitions saying what if my companies get a hostile acquisition was that a real Bell or is that a bell or whatever it was you know even if your company is not the target of a hostile acquisition I'm going to argue that the stock price you see for a company will reflect a weighted average of the status core value and the optimum value because markets attach a probability whether you like it or not that change will come so I'm going to talk about that the context did any of you have companies with voting and non-boarding shares let me ask you a specific question who valued Facebook because if you valued Facebook you had nobody wants to admit to it now right Facebook I'd even realize that voting non-voting shares they use the right share count I'll let you figure all those things out because you have until 5 PM to do it or maybe a little later if you want to withdraw it and send it back you valued voting and non-voting shares there's an issue right because how do we get the value per share we get the value of equity then we divide by the number of shares but what if I told you that instead of having a million shares your company has 400 000 14 shares and 600 000 non-vorting shares yeah you think so what I'll just add them up intuitively which one should trade at a higher price the voting shares or the non-voting shares okay and this is a challenge that bankers and appraisers have fed for a long time you know how they deal with it they take the share price they add a premium eight percent nine percent based on past studies avoiding and non-voting shares a very casual way of doing it I'm going to give you a way in which you can use the expected value of control to estimate that pre and finally I want to talk about what I call the minority discount let's say I own a private business and you come to me and you want to buy a slice of my business and I give you two choices you can get 49 of my business of 51 of my business literally two percent difference right you know that the 49 of my business you'll pay a lot less than a 51 percent why what do you get with 51 you control the business with 49 I continue to run it we'll talk about it's called a minority discount in private company valuation when you buy a steak that's not a controlling state so let's start with the first question how does this value of control play out in Acquisitions remember last session I valued Blockbuster twice I first valued it as a status quo company where the management kept opening stores even though nobody was coming into them came up with the value of five dollars and 13 cents per share then I revalued it with change right that you don't take those bad stores you don't open those stores that I came up with 12.47 Blockbuster was actually trading at nine dollars and fifty cents in July 2005. so let's say you trust my valuation would change 12 47. so what does it tell you if you buy Blockbuster at 950 it could be worth up to 12.47 if you can make those changes so let's say trust my valuation would you be willing to pay the 297 as a premium to buy blockbust right now why not well you you will it's not there you will now run the company you can make the changes and assuming you can make them right now so let's say the changes are reasonable why is it still not prudent to pay the entire 297 upper if you do whatever you effectively accomplished you're going to pay 12.47 to the Blockbuster shareholders they're going to be happy and then you're going to do all this work of fixing the company and assuming everything works what are you going to end up with 1247 and net present value of zero so if you're going to do a company or to buy a company in a hostile acquisition because you value control and you value the control then you want to at least get some share of it for yourself you'd like to keep a hundred percent for yourself but that's not going to happen but you'd like to keep fifty percent thirty percent that's the first place value control second I said even if your company is not the target of an acquisition the value of control plays out in the background let's go back to Blockbuster there was no hostile acquisition of Blockbuster but there was a stock price 950. I also gave you two values that I estimated 5.13 and 12.47 right 513 was the status core value 12.47 was the optimal value can I estimate a likelihood that the market is estimating for change coming and I have the status quo value optimal value I can solve for that number right based on the 9.50 stock price the likelihood of change coming in this company is about 60 percent this is after car like and showed up before he showed up the stock price is actually 8 20. there's only a 42 percent change now do you see why when you own a stock a Bill Ackman or a car like and showing up in your stock is going to cause a jump in your stock price it's not that your value went up but the likelihood of change went out when it happened so if I'd remove that likelihood of change you know what blockbuster is going to trade at it's going to go back to five dollars and Thirteen Cents and that's why you want to make an argument for corporate governance and capacity to change companies because without it you're going to end up trading at this status quo that let's talk about voting and non-voting shares so when you think about voting and onboarding shares now we can talk about the motivations for it happening but essentially you can argue so if in every publicly traded company the problem in every when you're rewarding a non-voting shares you're doing it for control purposes but there's a consequence so this was actually in in um for a Brazilian company called embroider and until a few years ago all Brazilian companies had two classes of shares voting and non-voting voting shares were called common shares the non-voting shares were called preferred shares very overwhelded your preferred why because you don't get voting rights really that's what makes me preferred you get a dividend up front but it's voting and non-voting shares so I valued and brought it twice the status quo value is 12 and a half billion the optimal value is 14.7 so by changing the company I can get a 2.2 billion dollar increase in value there were 2.242.5 million voting shares 476.7 million non-voting shares what am I trying to estimate how much higher should the voting shares trade relative to non-voting shares so what I'm going to start with is the non-boarding shirt so when you get non-voting shares what are you stuck with status quo there's nothing you can do right so I took the status quo value and divided by the total number of shares outstanding came up with a value of 17.38 so in other words if all you have is the status core value you'd pay 17.38 that becomes the value per share for a non-voting share what do I gain by do by gaining of getting a voting share I get a chance to change management just a chance not a guarantee there's a 20 chance that I can change management so that's my expected likelihood of the value control divide by just the voting shares I get a value per share of 19.19 I'm willing to pay an extra dollar 81 why because I think there is change is there's a chance of change happening and because I get a voting ship yeah and then let's look at the implications first there are a bunch of companies in the US supporting a non-voting shares right when you look at this structure and you look across companies where should that difference in voting and non-voting shares be greatest in badly managed companies or well-managed companies in badly managed companies right because in well-managed companies the expected value of control is going to go to zero and the voting shares and non-voting shares should pretty much trade at the same price if you get a chance you might want to check out Facebook Class A and Class B shares across that if my hypothesis is Right six seven years ago when people thought of Mark Zuckerberg as a management genius the two should trade at roughly the same price last year at the very bottom when nobody trusted Zuckerberg you should have seen the difference why I haven't checked it out but you might want to check on Bloomberg what that difference in price because about trade you can see what that premium and discount is so it's a different way of thinking about boarding and non-voting shares we don't automatically attach a premium to voting share you look at the company you're looking at the examining and you have to Value the company twice that's the downside is you have to do two discount evaluations I didn't ask you to do this but at one point in time as part of this project I used to ask everybody in the class to Value control in their company what do they have to do to Value control well you should have to look at your existing TCF and say what did I build in there right you built in margins and gravity then you would ask if somebody else ran the company somebody much more you know suited to this company what would Revenue growth margin and sales for Capital be and then you'd get two DCF values you'd have effectively what I have per Blockbuster number it's a good exercise the valuation is to look at those levers and see how they travel finally let's talk about minority discounts let's suppose I have a company and I value it twice it's a private business 1.6 million is the value with existing management me running it 2 million is the value with somebody much more efficient you're interested in buying a piece of my company I offer you 49 of my company what's the most you're willing to pay what are you stuck with when when I give you only 49 who continues to run the company I do you're kind of stuck with me so you're going to take 49 the status quo value if I offer you 51 percent of the same company you're going to be willing to pay up to you're not going to pay the up to the optimum value now do you see why Steve Cohen didn't want a minority stake in the match because who would be running the Mets still be the will points think of the value of the match with the will points running them and you say this is going to converge on zero it's like the Dolan's running Madison Square Garden when will these guys push the value to zero the less you think about the existing management the more of a minority discount you're going to attach it because you're stuck so this value of control is actually going to play out in multiple places in valuation it's good to get comfortable with those with the idea of value the company to a status core value optimal value and thinking of that difference as the value control so when I ask you how do you change the value of a company the basics are pretty much right out there right you can increase cash flows you can reduce cost to Capital you can lengthen your growth period but it is messy a lot of moving inputs and over the time you know this has been true for as long as consulting firms have been around consulting firms have discovered a very neat trip they've learned that CEOs have neither the attention span nor the willingness to actually think about multiple metrics Revenue growth margin that's too many already you know I have other things to do I have a meeting to go to can you put on one metric so I can focus on so consulting firms have discovered that if they can give them one magical metric that CEOs will buy it that magical metric often has you know is an acronym why acronyms always have this air in the air of mystery to them I don't know what's the many people actually use acronyms without actually knowing what the acronym stands for but often they're correlated with value so you're saying if you increase this your value will go up and by the way it's far simpler that's the upside simple the downside is when I pick just one variable in the DCF and ask you to focus on it so just push-up growth implicitly I'm assuming that by doing that you're not affecting margins you're not reinvesting more the danger when you use a simplistic approach is you can take advantage of weaknesses to exploit it so let me give you two measures that found their basis especially the last part of the last century that became very popular at conference the first was this notion called economic value added or Eva in fact I'm supposed to put a trademark right next to that with a little r on it because this was trademarked by a company called Stern Stewart that claimed to have invented it's an amazingly deep concept I'll describe what it is and you tell me how deep it is it takes a difference between return and capital and cost of capital and it says it's better to make more than your cost of capital than less it's amazing insight and once it gets its spread it multiplies it by Capital invest by saying if you can make a five percent spread on 5 billion it's better than making it on one billion even more amazing and you know for this incredibly insightful acronym CEOs paid tens of millions of dollars to Stearns to it to come in and calculate it for them and then stood through it connected compensation to it let's say if you increase this your value will go on so that's ebm concept took off in 1990s there was a point in time where half of the S P 500 companies were using Eva I could not talk about valuation that somebody's saying well what about EVN the other concept goes back even further in time it's called CF Roi I made you compute a return and invested capital in your company right it's based on operating income and Book value of capital and of course you're saying income is not cashed oh yeah so cash flow return investment first replaces operating income with a cash flow and then it brings in the time value of money so it's like an irr for a company in a year again the Insight is incredible it says look if you earn an irr that's greater than your cost of capital or a good company if you're in an irr less than your cost of capital or a bad company invented or concocted by this uh company called Holt Associates Credit Suites actually bought it in the late 90s for tens of millions of dollars they love the concept two acronyms and if you talk to stern Stewart or csfp their argument is you get a better value for your firm if you use cfroi or EBA then if you use a traditional discounted cash flow valuation which is absurd you know what Eva does in a traditional DCF valuation we take free cash to the firm and discontract at the cost of capital right what Eva does is it takes a free cash for the firm and it breaks it up into two pieces the free cash flow up to the cost of capital and a free cash flow in excess and it discounts the two pieces separately you're going to get exactly the same present value if you break cash flows down there was nothing new or intuitive about either measure in fact I wrote a paper essentially showing that you get exactly the same value of the firm at the BCF and Eva or cfroi there's nothing you're going to add to your valuation but bring their acronyms but there was another consequence because these were shortcuts and your compensation was tied to it managers started making decisions based on what can I do to increase my Eva even though that might might not be good for their company in the long term they were actually giving up value so they could deliver higher EBA and higher compensation but the history of Consulting is selling right I mean as I said you take the obvious you claim the Absurd then you charge the outrages that's a history of Consulting and in fact they played it up Stern Steward was founded by two men Joel Stern and Bennett Steward and Bennett Steward was an incredible salesman he could sell refrigerators to Eskimos he could do it you know he could sell people who don't need it and he sold Eva like it was going out of style I remember the first time I ran into Bennett it was at a panel discussion on value enhancement so the McKinsey guy gets up and you know Tim Kohler he talks about this kind of cash flow evaluation how to create value and then Bennett Stewart gets up and here's what he does he holds up an annual report an annual report for Coca-Cola and this is the late 90s when Coca-Cola was a star company done amazingly well and he said you want to be like Coca-Cola they're all CEO is a boring study higher we want to be like Coca-Cola this Coca-Cola uses Eva with those logic classes in high school you see what the third statement is right you use CBA you'll be just like Coca-Cola piss me off to no end so I abided my time and about two years later I was back on a panel with Bennett and this time I came prepared I knew exactly what his prop was going to be Coca-Cola annual report see he does the Coca-Cola and you report Coca-Cola is no do you want to be like Coca-Cola Coca-Cola uses EBA you should use EBA too so it's my turn and I'm supposed to speak but I don't I you know I take off my shoes or people in the audience what the heck is this guy doing and I brought these Air Jordans that just been released by Nike I put them on I took a box of Wheaties I brought me I had my props ready I poured myself a bowl people said what is this guy doing he's eating cereal on the panel you know wearing tennis shoes so after taking about three bites I get up to the mic and I say could somebody Point me towards a basketball hoop I've replicated what Michael Jordan does he eats Wheaties he puts I would like to slam dunk a basketball I would give you some background here my leaping ability is like six and a half inches off the ground right the only basketball hoop that I can slam dunk on is the Fisher-Price version that you have little kids I can eat all the Wheaties in the wood and wear all of the ten I'm not going to slam dunk a basketball Michael Jordan didn't become Michael Jordan because he was wearing Air Jordans but that's the message you get and said you know do you want Coca-Cola didn't become a great company the 80s and 90s because they used deviates because they did things right in their business they happen to use Eva on this side but arguing that because of Eva that they did this is you know but it's a sales pitch and you can see how well it worked so now let's turn back to your project let's talk about pricing right remember the four-step process for deconstructing multiples First Step make sure your multiple is consistently defined somebody tell me again what consistently defined means Yuki what is it if your numerator is a equity value denominator has to be an equity value you know so it's a it's a series of taxes and is it uniformly estimated second stop don't let people give you rules of doubt this is not 1965. we have the data get take a look at the entire data do a histogram what's high what's low play some Moneyball third stop you're not running away from making the assumptions you need to make in discounted cash flow valuation because internally within every multiple or all of the assumptions you make in a DCF about cash flows growth and risk remember that neat little trick of using a discounted cash flow model to back into the drivers of a multiple we can tell you what drives PE ratios EB debit up and only that should you apply Define describe analyze Supply and this is a slide you saw in the middle of your you know packet two or the end of the the pricing section where I said every multiple I can tell you what the drivers are by going back to a DCF model and doing some algebra price earnings ratios growth payout cost of equity ebit to sales operating margin so in a sense it gives you a sense of what questions to ask and what to control for when you're comparing across companies so I said to lose and asked you to pick a multiple right some of you tried six I know one person who tried 14 different multiples were getting really creative at some point and what they put in the denominator it was a search for a higher R square right we'll talk about how whether search can lead you but here's what you ended up using 58 of used Evita sales why for some of you it was desperation right you're losing money habitat was negative app it was negative net income was negative Book value of equity might have been negative for all I know you kept climbing and climbing and climbing said thank you God I finally found a positive number and you stopped none of you is doing a pre-revenue company or you'd have to keep going right but if users subscribers ebit says 58 that number so you look at eb2 sales EB to invest Capital EBT yeah those three numbers up that's almost 80 or actually about eighty percent so eight out of 10 companies used Enterprise Value multiples as opposed to equity markets in fact I wager that if you focus in on the price to book a few of them are financial service companies you had no choice but to use an equity multiple there to make the judge that is a statistic that I've tracked over time 20 years ago if you looked at this pie chart more than 50 percent were Equity multiples price earnings priced about over time we've increasingly moved away leverage has started shifting across sectors you see the shift towards Enterprise Value here's what uh you found I compared your DCF value to your pricing it was actually a little surprise because a 134 of you let me make sure I got that so actually this I switched up 177 of you your DCF value was higher than your pricing 136 of you the DCF value is lower so if you look across companies it's not a slam dunk that the DC event so even though the overall statistics suggested that you're getting more overvalued DCF many way companies your DCF value is actually higher than your pricing and if you look at the pricing results and I think this is the right statistic 134 of you party companies to be underpriced 179 overpriced little bet it's not 50 50 but you can see it's a little better than so your pricing pushed you to a different conclusion than your DCF valuation and that's done that's natural so here's what you're pricing most underpriced stocks so basically I took a price per share your DCF but basically you're comparing the pricing to the price per share and there are a few recommendations that go against your pricing right know why that happens because your intrinsic valuation gave you one signal your pricing gave you a different signal and he said I trust my intrinsic valuation more so if you see a buy here an American Airlines it's because you overwritten your pricing with your DCF valuation so whoever did Americans you're here is that the reason or is it just you meant to write cell and you actually wrote I don't know it no it could be any any number of different reasons but usually it's because your intrinsic valuation pushed you in the other direction so you can see almost underpriced stocks and there are cells that stand out when you look at the most overpriced again they're all sales at least thank God for that so most over your most overpriced stop don't tell any Elon Musk fans this is Tesla and and I'm willing to debate the pricing but that 8.65 suggests to me that you probably picked the wrong comps you know how you get 865 is you treat Tesla as an automobile company you do a multiple of revenues based on other automobile companies you're going to end up with really low so it's not technically you haven't done anything wrong but it shows you that if you price Tesla as an automobile company the game is already over Tesla is going to come out as massively overpriced okay so I'll let you kind of figure out why your companies are in that mix I did ask you to try an option pricing model right what are the two conditions you had to meet for an option pricing model to even be tried you remember no for the no for the option pricing in this case right Equity as a Liquidation option the exclusivity is when you have any option right for Equity to be a Liquidation option it had to First be it had to be a money losing company with what's the other condition a lot of debt without the debt the equity are this op this is the option liquidity we're not talking about the option to expand because those options getting the inputs is really messy the only option I could ask you to try to value what kinds of companies are going to see that companies like American Airlines companies which are essentially highly levered companies where the operating assets have to just pop for you to make money buying them as options remember those those dozen companies with a zero BCF value four of them at Option values that were positive in other words you wouldn't buy them for an intrinsic value basis but you'd buy them hoping and praying that something would happen most of the time nothing good would happen but if it did you're hoping to turn the 12 cents or 15 cents into three dollars per share so there were I think you know I think there were more than eight but when I was counting there were eight companies where I counted up front but the premium you're getting on average of a DCF value was about 41 that's why the option pricing one and then I asked you to make a recommendation but this created a lot of angst among you should I buy should I sell what should I do can I say hold I mean I got like 50 emails is it okay if I say hold no no if that's what you end up at that's okay but I tell you you fell into three groups when you got to this point one is I'm not sure yet be honest for most of you I'm not sure yet that's probably where you ended up here's the problem though when will you be sure it's a business it's Equity you know what there's always something around the corner some people say well once the banking crisis passes then I'll feature it no there'll be something else coming down to play I am not sure yet is going to be what you put on your Tombstone as an equity investor because you're the only time you're sure is when you're you know you're done right but basically you're always going to have uncertainty second is let's face whether you like it or not we're all believers in efficient markets sounds like a strange thing to say in what way when you buy something undervalued what has to happen for you to actually make money the price we're all believers in efficient markets the only question is when will markets become efficient we have a very convenient definition of market efficiency where markets are inefficient when we take a large position they become efficient after we do and finally the law of large numbers right let me ask you a question and I ask you for a buy or sell assuming you meant what you said about the buyer to sell do you think that that choice would be different if I asked you whether you put all your money in the store for five percent how many of your buys would stay biased if I said you got to put all your money in the stock I guess there's most of you say no I'm not that sure now do you see why spreading your bets is perhaps the only way you will act because if you're going to put 30 or 40 of your money in a particular company you're going to paralyze yourself with what if questions and what if something goes wrong because all you need is something to go wrong and there goes a third of your portfolio that would be my argument against Charlie Munger leaving 40 in apple I own Apple but I my Apple holding is seven percent of my portfolio I think it's a good company I'm not disagreeing with anything he says but when forty percent of your value comes from one company this is one bad day away from seeing a big chunk of it disappear so as for your recommendations and here's what you came back with 59 of you put sell recommendations 30 had buy recommendations and 11 for chicken well actually hold I know you tried and you tried and finally you said I can't pull the trigger no 59 that's so that would mean that there were about half as many buys as cells you want to see what that statistic has looked like over time take a look at the Brown Line right that's the that's the buy to sell right so when that number is one there has many buys itself so go back to 1999 there were as many buys as sell so pretty much set parity two years later that's the highest number ever got buys outnumbered cells by almost a 1.4 would spring 2001 what was happening dot com boom hit bust stock prices have collapsed wise okay buys again peak in 2009 after the 2008 crisis there was a brief period 2012 where they spiked but the last three years Buys have run at about 40 I mean it's not as low as this year but they've they've they've come down relative to sales whatever reason people are more cautious about the bias perhaps because the market is so much higher than it used to be oh incidentally I did do think I mentioned it I I did I mention the start of the class that I will be buying one of the stocks on your undervalued list you know what my condition is right goodbye you're going to get an email from me asking are you really buying not the buy that you wrote in and if you say no or I'm not sure yet I'm not buying either so I'm willing to go on this bet with you if you ask so if any of you on that undervalued list are actually buying what you tell me you're buying I'm not going to ask you for proof from your brokerage houses I will take you at your word and it doesn't have to be huge I'm not expecting to invest a hundred million dollars because that's not quite on the cards but tell me that you're taking a thousand dollars or five thousand dollars in buying this stock and I'll buy that I bought the I bought one stock of that undervalued list every year for 30 plus years with mixed effects on on average I've gained more than I've lost but I think it's fair that if you kind of follow the rubric of the class and you say bye and you're actually putting your money in it that I should come along to the right now in terms of that choice between value and price tribute which is better one is it depends on what your value right so if I give you an asset which doesn't have cash flow so God's sakes don't even try to value what am I talking about to ask you what's the value of code your response is gold cannot be valued it's not a cash flow generating asset as you what's the value of Bitcoin don't even go there Bitcoin if it's a currency can be priced there are some things that cannot be valued because they don't have cash flows pricing is easier if things are marketable right things are traded and there are other things like it so if something is unique it's more difficult to price it than if something has a lot of comparence so the choice between value price is going to depend on the asset it's also going to depend on you as a person remember we talked about time Horizon if you have a six-month time Horizon you're much more suited to pricing than valuation don't fight if I went around this room and asked you what's your time Horizon you know what you're all trained to say I have a really long time Horizon why because that's what you're supposed to say but you know what it's not often your choice you were born impatient your time Horizon might be 15 minutes why are you fighting it in fact if I would at Berkshire Hathaway let's face it Charlie monkers time Horizon is pretty short right now and I don't want to be morbidden you're 97 years old you're not mapping out things over two days maybe that's why he's okay with apple being 40 of its portfolio because as long as it stays okay for the next two or three years or four years or maybe five yeah not his problem maybe if it were 60 years old he'd be worth asking the question if he was 60 years old and apple or one stock whatever the stock was was 40 would you that would have been a good question let me plant that question when he's 98 next year I'd like you to show up Norma and ask if you were 40 years younger would you be okay with apple being 40 of your portfolio time Horizons matter your reasons for doing the valuation matter most of you are going to end up in jobs why are you doing valuation at your jobs to earn a paycheck it's a very different game so keep your managing director happy that's your own game it's not about delivering the right value you can see how already biases start to enter in the process when you're valuing for other people and finally what do you believe about markets is going to dry whether you go with value price in when you do intrinsic valuation you assume that markets make mistakes across time and they correct them over time and pricing issue markets are right on average but they're wrong in individual company different views on price I'm not going to stand here and say values better than price I like intrinsic valuation it suits me but you have to find your own choice and it's going to be different for different so this was a question I told you I would ask I asked at the start of the class would you not done your evaluation you've not done your pricing now that you've actually valued a company and priced your company I'm going to revisit that question so given your experiences I'm not asking what will make me happy so don't worry about what I'd like to see given your experiences value your company and pricing your company to ask you how many of you would pick discounted cash flow evaluation intrinsic value how many of you would go with intrinsic valuation put up your hands how many of you go with pricing because you found it much cleaner you know how many of you at this point have decided that the best thing to do with your lives is not even tried to do it it's actually a very healthy recognition right wait because you realize how much the no value value pricing how much you don't know how many things can go wrong it's a very healthy recognition because you know what it's going to save you right all those hours you're going to spend valuing and pricing companies you can take it off your list do what instead have fun you know what Through the Ages you could you could live happy fulfilling lives without ever valuing the company there's nothing there's no law that says you have to Value companies so this is not your job and you so buy an index fund go back to having fun with the rest of your life it's actually the healthiest conclusion that 90 of people can take so if you got there just take it as the biggest lesson you got think I would like half of all those brokerage fees you'd have spent if you could mail those to me as thank you for saving me that much money I'd be glad to take it and remember at the start of the class I said are you a Storyteller or a number cruncher if you are a Storyteller this is what I hope the class has done for you it's given you a little more confidence working with numbers if you've never completed a return on Capital at least you now know what it is and how flawed it is so the next time somebody tries to intimidate you with a heroic stop them and say I know what Troy kiss and I know how flawed it is and that'll kind of stop the discussion right there I want you if you're a Storyteller to get comfortable with the numbers that you can use numbers as part of your story they'll make your story stronger it'll also keep you more disciplined in your storytelling you're not telling fairy tales so if you're a Storyteller I hope you become a more disciplined storyteller some of you came into this class as natural number crunches and here my task was more difficult right what was my task is to make you trust your own imagination and God this was a tough thing to do right because you wanted confirmation your entire life was dot the eyes cross the t's you're in your inner accountant kept speaking up saying this is so subjective that word comes up all it's subjective life is subjective right I mean because if you by subjective you mean things can happen that I can't control so if you're a Storyteller I hope you developed a little more willingness to trust your imagination to allow Loose Ends to stay loose because if you wait for every Lucent to be tied up you will never complete a valuation so work on your weak side the strong side will take care of itself work on your weak side so here's my final set of suggestions I'm not great for advice so I'm going to frame them as suggestions push the more I hear about this time is different the more I realize this time is not fundamentals always matter the basics of business don't change you can put a.com at the end you can put an AI in the front it doesn't make a difference a business ultimately has to generate cash flows the risk in those cash flows matter and values driven by the time second I don't know whether you notice it but there were things you got stuck on in the valuation where when you step back and said why did I waste two days doing it because it didn't make any difference but that's that's part of how you learn what makes a difference or not in fact if you spend two I know at least you know one person in this class who spent an entire week on Equity risk premium because seven percent of his company's Equity risk groups came from rest the rest of the world and he spent two weeks trying to figure out what the rest of the world is so you could get a more precise number I didn't have the heart to tell that if you took the global Equity risk premium attached to the seven percent you're going to get roughly the same answer as two weeks of hard work to get there so learning what to focus on and what to let go is a big part of valuation so understanding the big picture is critical third how many of you have graduated they are going to go to work there and this Grizzle veteran is going to show up and say oh my gut tells me eight times if it dies cheap my gut tells me that what you're doing doesn't make sense is betas no stop trusting people's guts this is a business we're having a lot of experience doesn't necessarily endow you with wisdom people say really stupid things and claim it to be conventional wisdom they love anecdotal evidence use data as your counter eight times hepatitis C pull up the number of companies that trade less than eight times every day and say are you telling me all these companies are cheap you have access to s p Capital like you for the moment right maybe you want to get this list ready to use when you start fourth remember it's only evaluation I still remember about 15 years ago I was teaching this to the MBA second year MBA it's a history major Premiere would come back for a business school because history majors don't get paid very much yeah and if you're a history major Premier who comes back for an MBA you take what I call the Strategic route you can now add the word sustainable to that route as well what do you do you pick classes with the word sustainable or strict teaching in the name you can go through two years of nambia without ever seeing a number yeah by accident I think she ended up in my evaluation class which is neither strategic nor sustainable and she turned out to be pretty good at it so at the end of the class she comes up to me and she says I never thought this would happen but I have a job as a sell-side equity research access I said my condolences no I said congratulations I'm really scared and I said what are you so scared about she said make a mistake brain surgeon a brain surgeon makes a mistake somebody dies on the operating table you make a mistake what's the worst that's going to happen somebody gets a little richer somebody else gets a little poorer just make sure that somebody else is getting a little poor is not you that's your only criteria to be think like a Marxist you move some wealth around the world has intended who cares and finally if you're ever given a choice between being lucky and knowing everything there is to know about valuation which one should you pick just like being lucky I know I'm not supposed to say this I'm supposed to say it's kill matters you know no luck dominates every single one of those things brought home to me by my mother-in-law when she came to visit in 2000 peak of the.com and she got very interested in investing which to me should have been a sign to get out of the market mother-in-law interest in investing get out of the market right now but I missed that time and she would talk to me all day about what was in her portfolio what was out of what she wished was in him and she thought I was interested but I had to act interested and then she let it slip that she owned Qualcomm one of the great stocks of 99 up 400 he said press I said Judy how do you pick Qualcomm I knew the minute I asked this question I shouldn't have because she told me she said she bought Qualcomm because it owned MCI I said that's not Qualcomm that's welcome it's Qualcomm Worldcom what's the difference I said you pick the wrong company you know after she left I did try a strategy pick a company in the news pick one that rhymes with it you know you know what if it would work forget this cash flow stuff it would have been the rhyming stock strategy that I've tried I was afraid to ask her after that why she owned Cisco which is another stock Sheeran afraid the answer might be I really like their vegetable oil or Saturday Night Live which would be disco but who knows what drove that particular choice but the bottom line is if you're lucky so if you find your stocks going up and you go into a particular Starbucks and you get a venti cappuccino here's my advice move out of your apartment right next to Starbucks keep going and getting anti-cappuccinos don't mess with luck if it's working in your favor so that's about it for me and I will see you on Friday for the final exam thank you
