hi welcome to valuation i know many of you come in with preconceptions about what this class is about and rather than feed into those preconceptions i'd like to talk about what this class is not about and in the process perhaps perhaps you will get a sense of what this class is about i know for many of you valuation is a set of equations and formula and models and perhaps that is what you're expecting to get as science i'm sorry to disappoint you but valuation is not a science it is a craft and the essence of a craft is you learn through trial and error there is no perfect way of doing things there's a better way of doing things put simply you don't learn valuation by talking about it or watching other people talk about it so i hope that this class will help you learn valuation as a craft by doing it you will find that as you work through this class it will get easier when you start it's going to be difficult that's the nature of a craft and as you get more comfortable you'll start to get more comfortable also deviating from a script rather than cook from a recipe you'll be able to cook on your own second i know for many of you you're expecting a class built around valuing publicly traded companies you want to value the coca-colas the airbnbs the ubers the facebooks of the world and that's okay that's pretty much what many people think about valuation but i hope to make this class much more than valuing just public companies i want to talk about valuing private companies i want to talk about buying small companies and large companies develop market companies in emerging market companies and along the way what i hope you will see in this class is the principles of valuation are universal you don't really need to relearn valuation to value a specific group of companies you just need to take the existing principles evaluation and apply them differently along the way we'll talk about how value can be different from the inside when managers look at a company i suppose from the outside as investors looking at a company not because the principles change but because managers control more of the levers they can change the way a companies run by the end of this class i hope you can value just about any kind of business small or large in whatever sector in whatever market third i want to draw a contrast between two words we use interchangeably in investing value and price let me set this on the table if i believe that markets were efficient what i'm effectively saying the value and the price are pretty much the same thing and if you believe that there's really no point taking this class i believe that the value of an asset is driven by cash flows growth and risk and we're going to talk a lot about how to value an asset in this class but we're also going to talk about how to price that same asset what does that mean to price an asset you look at what other assets just like it are being priced at in the market and i'm going to argue that the pricing process can give your number very different than the value process we're going to go through both valuing and pricing assets along the way and we're going to look at some investments that cannot be valued currencies for instance cannot be valued they can only be priced a collectible cannot be valid it can only be priced fourth i'm going to surprise you i know many of you are going to come into this class expecting to see excel spreadsheets and i'll make a confession i've never opened an excel spreadsheet in the context of a class to me the essence of evaluation is not the collection of numbers that make it but the story behind the numbers you can hear a lot of storytelling in this class but storytelling with a purpose where every number in my evaluation is connected to a story and every story i tell you about a company is connected to numbers finally i don't believe in valuing things just for the sake of valuing them i'm a pragmatist i believe that if you value something you need to be willing to act on it what does that mean if you find something to be undervalued you have to be willing to buy it you're saying so what's so difficult about doing that you're going to recognize that there's a difference between figuring out that something is misvalued and acting on it and that difference can be bridged only with faith faith in what faith in your own value and faith that markets will correct that price will move to value much more difficult than it sounds on the outside so what i hope to during this do during this class is not just deliver the techniques and the tools evaluation but give you some insight into how you can connect stories to value the difference between value and price and how you go about acquiring the faith to be able to act on evaluations i hope you will find this class useful no matter what perspective you bring into the class 
so much um you thinking okay folks I see some familiar faces here so how many of you are in my corporate finance class last year not as many as I thought Okay so for many of you this is going to be your first class with me I would think so see how this goes um just to get you set for how this class will be structured at the start of every class there will be a quiz don't worry it won't be graded it won't affect your overall grade you know what the quiz will be about it's about the sub step we will do during the course of the class so it sounds like it's backwards right the squids should come after the the point of the quiz is to actually raise questions about what we're going to talk about during the course of the class and let you get a chance to actually see if you can come up with the answer in which case you're saying you know what's the point of the class and I would like that to be the end game is much of what we're going to talk in the class you could have figured out by yourself having this class might provide you a structure but we're going to start every class with a quiz so since we're going to do that every class I thought we'd start this class too with a quiz you know this class it's called valuation and there's a story behind that I'll come back and talk about that but I want to get a sense of why you're taking the class what do you expect to see in the class and I'm going to structured in in the in the form of in a bunch of questions I'm going to ask you so here's the first one and we'll come back and talk more about this but you often see people talk about valuation as an art as a science accountants claim that they've made it more scientific so my first question don't you don't have to tell me the answers I said we'll come back and talk about it if I ask you to describe valuation as a discipline would you describe it as a science and I let you define what comprises a science is it an art is it black magic white magic whatever magic you want to call it or is there something else some other word you used to describe it so file that away we'll come back and address that question sometime during the course of the classroom everybody made a choice art science magic something else second when you go into evaluation class you have a preconception about what kinds of companies you're going to wear okay and I'm going to give you you know four groups of companies and I want you to think about which of these companies is going to be easiest to value and which ones you think will give you the biggest payoff to doing valuation two separate questions which ones are going to be easiest to value and which ones will give you the biggest payoff to do evaluation so here are the four groups of companies the first star is a mature company in a nice Stable Market Nice stable economy it's your first choice second is a mature company in an Emerging Market in an unsettled Market doesn't even have to be emerging it could be a developed Market going through a crisis the third choice is a young company and I'll let you think about what a young company looks like in terms of revenues and earnings and financials in a nice mature in a nice stable economy and the four choices a young company in an unsettled Market let's let's start with the two extremes which of these four groups of companies is going to be easiest to value anybody want to give that a shot yes and why you have a lot of crutches right you have historical deity of a business model you have lots of opinions you know what the company does you know how it makes money and that's where traditional valuation classes tend to spend most of their time on new value Coca-Cola over and over again for 15 weeks and you feel really good because you feel you've mastered valuation one of the things I'm going to argue in this class is anybody can value Coca-Cola you could be a 10 year old a jar of candy in about an hour I can teach the 10 year old enough valuation to be able to Value Coca-Cola in fact I probably don't even need a person I could probably automate the process not talking chat GPT kind of automation just very basic Excel Automation and it can value coca-core which of the four groups of companies is going to be most difficult about you yes the fourth one why an lack of stable is vertical data and uh too many variables click on it's too much uncertainty right what's your reaction uncertainty as human beings we're going to denial we push it away we Outsource it and most of the time we say you cannot value companies when there's too much uncertainty but VCS do it all the time VCS don't value companies their price PCS can't value a 20 bill in a brown paper bag if you put in front of them they're price companies I'll talk about the contrast between value something and pricing something because it's it's going to be something I come back and harp on you're going to be tired of me drawing that contrast by the end of the semester but I think it's healthy for you as investors as analysts as anybody involved in this process to recognize what you're doing are you valuing something are you pricing it which brings me my third and final question and this is something again where I don't expect a right or wrong answer I want you to look inward each of us has a strong side and a weak side and I know there's a legend of a left brain and a right brain I've been told that that's not that's mythology but let's stay with that there's a left brain there's a right brain there's number side and a story side I want you to think about which of those two sides is your strong side are you more comfortable working with numbers are you more comfortable telling stories you're saying how would I know I've known for a long time how can you not know I'll tell you when I knew I was about 12 years old I was in my first English literature class and was asked to Read Moby Dick and I did I was a good kid I came prepared for a discussion of Wales and captains in about 20 minutes into the discussion I realized they weren't talking about the wind so I put up my answer when are we going to talk about the wear the instructor said there is no will and I said did I read the wrong book I don't distinctly remember a big fish running all the way through the book but she said it's a metaphor my jaw dropped and the rest of the class was about hidden meanings and things I didn't even know I had a meaning in the first place I remember coming out of the class with the singular conclusion I said never again am I going to subject myself to that kind of my school life was laid out in front of me right I avoided when Algebra 2 algebra 3 out of high school and these were the good old days no College looked like in the good old days you went to college and you picked courses you wanted to take as opposed to what as opposed to this crappy Core Curriculum they make you take today you know what I'm talking about go take a history class why it'll make your rounded individual now it's got nothing to do with rounding you you know why you need to take a history class because if you did not do it there would be no need for a history Department in the first place right I mean who voluntarily says I want to take 15 history classes and then you got a numbers degree accounting engineering and then you had a numbers job and who do you hang out with other numbers people dangerous place to be when you hang out with people who think just like you we'll talk about some of the delusions that come in when you're a numbers person more as we go on through the class but some of you are numbers people like me but there are other people in that class who like Dory telling side who likes seeing hidden meanings they took literature one literature two literature three they went on to become history majors at Yale they graduated they discovered that even Yale history majors don't make much money you're poverty-stricken wages as a journalist or whatever and then four years later you said I'm sick and tired of living like this and guess what you're in this room right now right there's some recovering number crunches and recovering storytellers in this room my guess is more storytellers and number crunches because there's always a self-selection bias the story tell us gravitate towards the strategy classic because they can tell story after story after Story nobody checks your stories you can have fairy tales the castles everybody's happily ever after but my guess is there are still people in this class who are more naturally storytelling people so I want you to classify yourself on your stronger side and then I want you to think about which skill do you think matters more when you value companies is obvious evaluation at all about numbers but one of the things I'm going to talk about today is how you need both sides working stories and numbers so with that lead-in let me close this up and as I said every session we're going to start with this kind of test so okay so let's talk about this class let me first talk about me why because I like talking virus I came to NYU in 1986. I can tell I'm getting all the other uh last semester last year when I taught this class I got in the elevator student gets on who's an MBA and she says my mother took your class I said okay that's nice to know I'm glad it wasn't your grandmother because then I know I should be retiring yeah 1986 lifetime ago and when I first came to NYU I was given a class to teach Scott class called security analysis you've heard of this last class with a long and worried tradition the classroom started in the 1950s at Columbia University by a guy called Ben Graham you might have heard of it if you haven't you've heard of his most famous student you know who I'm talking about right the Voldemort of business or Warren Buffett basically he who shall not be named thank you it's a class with the long tradition they give me this class and this is you need to teach this class I take one look at the class and I'm not teaching this class most boring class ever because by 1986 it was showing its age it was four weeks in stocks and three weeks of bonds and two weeks on options and Futures and five weeks at institutional detail like what there was an entire session on listing requirements for the New York Stock Exchange was so easy the days before Wikipedia you could actually come to classes these are the Dozen listing requirements go through the whole class everybody took everything down and thought you were a genius if I tried that today you'd be checking Wikipedia while I'm talking I can see it right here why is he talking about it so under the head of my department said I want to teach this class he should have fired me on the spot but he's a good guy he said what would you like to teach instead I said I'd like to teach a valuation class he said don't do it there isn't enough stuff for evaluation to fill a class and you know what he was absolutely right in 1986 there wasn't enough stuff in valuation to fill a class there were no books on valuation unless you wanted to go with security analysis by Ben Graham you know and that was written anybody want to guess the year it was right 1934 was the first edition I want you to remember that when you read security analysis it is a product of the times you came out of the Great Depression what was the first and biggest Mission you had in investing safety right you have to protect yourself and that runs all the way through the book it's not a good thing or a bad thing but it it drives how Ben Graham talks about valuation so what so guess what he likes he likes phone companies that pay big dividends you gave him Tesla he's going to freak out right but I really really wanted to teach this class and I discovered very early in my university life that if you want to get anything done at the University this is advice you should take best way to do it is to not ask for permission because if you try to ask for permission and approval you know what would happen right a committee will be created you know what happens in committees get created you might have experienced committees they meet and they meet and they forget what they're meeting about and they keep meeting and then they have baby committees that they're called subcommittees and sub-sub committees it's all very incestors they report to each other and 35 years later they come back and say you could teach the class but I'd be too old to do it so I said okay I'll teach you security analysis class and I walked into the classroom shut the door and taught evaluation class remember this was 1986 there were no cameras in the classroom they had no idea what I was doing inside the room I could have been teaching cooking for 15 weeks and as long as I gave everybody A's nobody would complain right you know how long it took them to catch on in 2008 I get a call from the Dean's office we're here you're teaching evaluation class I said yes I've been doing it for 22 years we don't see it listed anywhere in the course listings I said that's easy to explain I've been hijacking all these other classes you've been giving me and teaching valuation instead for 15 years they made me teach a class called equity instruments and markets I don't have the least amount of Interest in instruments I don't care much about markets not that enamored with equity in the first place that kind of leaves me with nothing to do right so I feel evaluation they said that's not right we should call it valuation I said I agree if you look at nyu's course listings valuation shows up for the very first time in 2008. it's almost like it caused the market crash the minute they called it graduation but this semester I'm teaching two sessions of valuation one to you and one to the undergraduates right after I teach exactly the same class for both groups it'll be my 59th and 60th semester teaching valuation I'm going to say something about this class it's going to encapsulate how I think about valuation everything I know about valuation I've learned in the course of teaching this class let me repeat that again everything I know about valuation I've learned in the course of teaching this class not I don't know I don't know I'll give you a few examples one year into teaching this class it was the fall of 1987 specific date October 19th of 1987. it was a Monday he was teaching this class at that time nyu's graduate school business school was downtown right next to the American Stock Exchange I finished teaching my class I come back to my office I look out of my window and I see that everybody in the exchange floor is out on the street the fire alarm went off you know what happened on October 19th of 1987. anybody remember enough history yes on that one day the S P 500 dropped 22 I want you to think about what a day like that would look like today if the Dow dropped 22 percent maybe what 8 000 Point drop you do all three cards right and people were freaking out the reason they were on the street is they could not get that trade remember these were the days of physical trading they could not get the trades through on the floor it was too confusing yeah it was a one-day bear Market Wednesday I'm in front of my class and guess what the first question I'm asked is how would your valuation tools can you it's all about you at this point nobody wants to take ownership of anything in valuation because they've decided this is pointless do you explain it 22 drop in the market in one day and I'd be lying if I said I knew the answer but I said okay let's think about it let's think about what causes and that started me on the process of understanding Market crises what happens during Market it's not like your cash flows change in two minutes or two hours it's a price of risk changing but what I started thinking about on that day in October 19th of 1987 stood me in good stead when the.com bus came when 2008 came in 2020 the first quarter of 2020 when covet hit it's something I've gone back to over and over again and each time you do it you understand a little bit more about Market crisis you moved 10 years forward I stood to remember the day somebody in my class puts up their hand and said have you ever heard of this company called amazon.com it's an online book retailer I said okay that sounds interesting I don't even know what that means but let's try battling the company I valued Amazon for the first time in 1997. and I still tell people everything I know about very young startup companies or young companies I learned in the process of valuing Amazon so you see my read my Tesla valuation from three days ago you see the imprints of what I learned when I valued Amazon when I started because when I first valued Amazon I went through every textbook on valuation including my own and there was nearly a mention of how to Value companies with lots of potential small revenues and big losses it had never been done before because it was not something that valuation people thought would ever cross their path and you get to 2008 and you got a market credits it's a market crisis created by Banks Behaving Badly I remember the question again in class when Banks behave badly why the valuations of all other companies affected we have to talk about the side costs of what happens when financial service companies behave badly then you got to the first quarter of 2020. remember Corbett heads the entire global economy shuts down an experiment we'd never run before where the entire global economy had shut down and people had no idea what would happen if you try to start it up again I was teaching this class and in fact I remember March 6 that I get this email from NYU saying go home we'll be back in three weeks there's this virus floating around we weren't talking we were definitely not back in three weeks but the class continued on zoom and on March 23rd of 2020 the absolute bottom of that covet Market meltdown people are just basically giving up and running for the Hills I chose to value our boring in class and the reason I picked Boeing it was in the epicenter of the crisis right it's clients or its customers or Airlines and airlines are not flying they're not buying aircraft and the quest was Will Boeing make it what's the risk here and I said look let's do this now they said why can't we wait for the crisis to pass that's always the response you get right once brexit is done then we can value UK companies you got to invest in the market you're in not the market you wished you were in you can't wait out crisis because your best chances at Value companies and finding good Bargains might be during a crisis and during the last decade we had the phenomena what I call the numbers company let me explain we look at a copy like Facebook the most impressive number about Facebook not the amount of money spending on the metaverse that's an impressively bad number but let's think about the impression it's not the revenues it's not I mean lots of companies have revenues higher than Facebook it's got high margins but Philip Morris has even higher margins Apple has higher margins what's the most impressive number about Facebook three billion people in its ecosystem think about it it's mind-boggling if you combine Facebook Instagram WhatsApp you've got three billion people one out of every two adults in the face of the earth is on the Facebook ecosystem you think so what nine I think it was 2017 somebody in the class and if you think about a company like Netflix what's the most impressive number number of subscribers not the margins not how much money they make 2017 in this class I've always started this room so it's in this room I don't even remember which road what somebody put up the answer can you value a Netflix subscriber notice a question it wasn't can you value Netflix because that you can value the traditional way revenues margins can you value a Netflix subscriber and I said why not I'm stupid enough to keep falling into the strap and saying why not but the next two weeks I developed an infrastructure to value a Netflix subscriber and it's not rocket science right somebody help me out if I wanted to value a Netflix subscriber what is the information I would need to do that valuation yes first is I need to know how long the subscriber stays on which is a function of children's already you can see things you don't talk about tradition what's the churn rate it's a percentage of people who re-up each year that number is like 95 for Netflix partly because people want to say start subscribing to Netflix forget that subscribe and they keep subscribing for the rest of your time so let's say it's 15 years what's the next step what do I need next okay so let's assume this is and that's fairly straightforward right it basically what is it 21 if you get the premium subscription with an inflation rate or whatever you want to build so I get expected subscriptions for the next 15 years I have to net out some costs there must be some direct costs associated with servicing subscriptions he said what about content costs it's not at the subscriber level right but if your valuable Spotify subscriber it is you know why what is it about Spotify that makes it different from Netflix in terms of Contra costs they both license the you know Netflix license or content it pays a upfront fee it's a fixed cost whereas Spotify you know how you pay for Content based on the number of based on number of streams this is so basically if they have lots of subscribers and everybody's streaming Taylor Swift the cost goes up already you can see it makes you think about business models that you wouldn't have thought about but evaluated Netflix subscriber and then from that you can value Netflix as a company right you can multiply by the number of subscribers and then you subscribers you can bring in the cost of acquiring it and I'm glad I did that because that framework I used to Value Spotify I used to Value Amazon Prime as a standalone and I used it to Value an Uber Rider much messier than a Netflix subscriber right because there it's not the same amount free you have heavy Uber users and light Uber users you got to figure out what the average Uber Rider spends on those rides but these are things so 2010 I wasn't thinking about the value we use a subscriber so when you think about what what what drives this process it's about what's happening so in 2023 what will happen 2022 I've Revisited an old friend or old friend Revisited me for a long time in the U.S and Europe we've forgotten about inflation right inflation is like this forgotten stepchild or actually it's more like a middle child who always delivers good grades you never worry about the child after all you stop thinking about inflation 2022 it reminded that that middle child can have all kinds of addiction problems and all of a sudden you've got a problem child it's amazing how people have forgotten what inflation can do to valuation and how to deal with inflation evaluation so long story short this class is basically a summation of experiences that I've kind of tried to structure and present and everything this is what I've learned so far in valuation there's a long way to go but welcome to the journey because at the end of this class you might learn what I've learned over the last 36 years but you need to keep learning this is a process it doesn't end with this so if you're thinking you're going to master valuation by the end of this class when I would have you know I would love to know how you got there because I I'm not I I'm not even close to being there in terms of thinking about what valuation is all about so that long lead and let's talk a little bit about the logistics of the class my office is on the ninth floor of the next book so you know I list our office hours we're back to physical office hours so I will Zoom the office hours as well in case you're still not comfortable being in an office my email address is probably the easiest and most direct way of getting to me I don't answer my phone so we call my number and leave a message the voicemail is so full that I don't even know how to check the voicemail and it was a very elaborate system so don't do it okay my office hours are basically right before this class so I would set up as I said the zoom link to you and the teaching it's in bunsey who is gesture and Rakesh both took this class last year so they know exactly what's involved in this class they will have office hours and I'll list out their offices they'll also do a review session each week where they cover problems from past quizzes related to the material so with that lead and let's talk about what this class is about what I'm going to say for the next 30 minutes to me is the most critical part of this class everything else is icing on the cake it's strange way to introduce a class because I'm saying after the first class and nothing else matters it's not what I'm saying after the first class everything else is going to build on what we're going to say in this class so I'm going to list out what drives this class in the form of a few teams that are going to run through the class here's the first one I asked you about was this uh valuation and art or a science let me revisit that question is valuation in science a tough question to answer so let me reframe the question to make it simple is mathematics Society you want to drive is mathematics or science it's the only pure science in fact mathematicians are convinced that the rest of us are imposters so let me follow up what is it about mathematics that makes it a science okay it's your either right or you're not two plus three is help me outwards two plus three five left hand right hand North Pole South Pole calculator computer super computer it's the same answer it's not it might be five it could be five it is five you get the inputs right you get the output right if you get the output wrong you must have done something wrong so let me reframe the question now in terms of evaluation if that is what makes for a science that we get the inputs right you get the output right mathematics is a science physics is mostly a science laws of gravity are the laws of gravity because valuation of any chance of being a science that's a question I'm asking you you work really hard to value a company you do everything you can do you collect all the data on the face of the Earth that you can get on the company you talk to every Management in the company you talk to angry equity research analyst you talk to experts you bring in all your valuation tools you use them right you value the company what is the likelihood that you're going to get the right answer zero you know what because you're trying to forecast the future let's say you valued a hotel business Marriott in 2019 you did everything right you know what you forgot to incorporate an evaluation that six months later the whole world had shut down and nobody would be in a hotel if you knew Kobe was coming in 2019 there's probably somebody in a court system somewhere who needs to talk to you about how you knew that but the reality is you could have done everything right but you couldn't have forecast out that code it was going to come in a few months which made your entire valuation kind of defunct valuation is zero chance of being assigned so the sooner we accept that the healthier the discussion about valuation becomes I mean every week I I get another email from some national appraisal group saying we're going to try to make valuation more scientific no I remember four years ago I got this from the Indian government saying we're working on creating a set of appraisal rules and principles to make valuation would you be interested in serving on the panel and I said you can't pay me enough money to be on that panel because you're trying to do something that cannot be done you could write a lot of rules thinking that's going to make your valuations better but guess what it's not going to change the thing valuation is not and has never been a science so it must be an art right let's break that part let's again make the question simpler is painting and I'm not talking about painting your house but painting portraits painting paintings that hang in the mat yeah I still remember when my oldest son was eight years old he's now 32 so it's been a long time it's actually 33 so he's actually aging as I talk I took him to the Met to watch to see a Picasso exhibit that was going through so he lasted about 30 minutes which is pretty impressive for an eight-year-old in a museum so you come out 30 minutes later and ask him hey Ryan what did you think of that exhibit he said dad I was not impressed Picasso exhibit he said this guy can't get the nose in the right place you notice about Picasso's the nose comes out of the side of the head the top of the head the back of the head it's almost like he was drunk or drugged which give it because of history is probably both but for whatever reason we've gathered together said that special great artists are born you can't teach them you can teach paint in the numbers kind of art but you're not going to get you're not you can turn out all the impressionist paintings you want but nobody's paying 100 million dollars for your painting the essence of an artist you cannot teach it thank God valuation is not an art because if it was or not I wasted much of my life teaching something that cannot be done so it's not a science and not an art what the heck is it I'll give you the word I used to describe valuation it is a craft now I'll give you the discipline that I think is closest to valuation it's cooking think of how you master cooking you could watch the Food Network 24 hours a day in theory you can tell me how to make a souffle but you try making it I still remember and I first started cooking they said whipped the egg into a so that it has a top I sort of what the heck does that even mean how do you whip an egg and how does it have a top you could read every cookbook there is to read about cooking and you won't be able to cook to learn cooking what do you have to do you actually have to cook at the first time you cook guess what happens our alarms go off now I still remember the first time I scrambled eggs nobody told me you're supposed to spray the damn pan I scramble the egg great looking egg stuck to the pan and egg goes in the trash but I learned a very important lesson about scrambling X foreign cooking by cooking and you're going to get better as you cook but the first time you cook don't expect miracles be ready to order out you learn valuation by doing not so when you watch me talk about valuation or you watch me do valuations you might think you get it but until you actually value companies it's not going to stick and I'm going to force you to Value companies and as diverse a group of companies as I can get you to Value during the course of the semester because that's the way you're going to get better at valuation it's going to take two forms one is a project where you're going to Value an individual company but it's one company but every week I'm also going to put up what I call a valuation of the week I'll give you a preview tomorrow I'm going to put up my first valuation of the week it's going to be my valuation of Tesla I'm going to emphasize the word my valuation of Tesla with the blog post explaining the valuation and there's going to be a Google Chat spreadsheet you're saying for what I would encourage you to try to Value Tesla and your reaction is going to be but this is the first week of the class I really don't know how to Value companies to change what you feel comfortable changing come up with a value put into Google shared spreadsheet I make a prediction in week one you're all going to agree with me and most if you're going to agree with me you know what you change the third decimal point and the risk periods everything else looks pretty good I will leave it as this I create histograms of what the Google spreadsheet valuations look like in the first week or two or three you get this column right on top of my valuation but here's what's going to happen as you go through this class you're going to get more and more comfortable disagreeing with me that's a good thing I wanted to get to a point in week sixes that pz cousins Nigeria evaluation you put up terrible I think your growth rate is off new value is off and I'm so good the class is working so I'm going to take you on a path where we're going to start with Tesla then I'm going to go to PC cut you've never heard of PC cousins Nigeria right it's a consumer product company in Nigeria then I pick a commodity company BHP maybe then we'll come back and value palette so each week I'll pick a company as different from the previous week because I want and it's completely optional I mean people have often described this class as trying to drink out of a horse you know some of you are going to say look this is gagging me I can't do it then that's fine you might say this is too much for me but I'd like you to think about value at least some of those companies because that's the way you get more comfortable with the tools and valuation you're going to get better at the crap but guess what you never Master a craft there used to be this show called This Old House it's a PBS show one of the oldest home shows that predates the home network and they used to be a market Master Carpenter called Norman I don't even know his last name on it and he would say look and I know how to do these things but to do this I have to talk to somebody who's done who's I have to learn same thing about valuation you think you got if you think you got the thing mastered the market is waiting for you to get to that point because it's got a surprise waiting for you it's a process you keep working at it you never quite Master it but you will get better at it let's move on to the second thing I talked about this fixation I have about two words that should never I think be mixed up one is the word value the other is the word press let me give you the big picture perspective we know let me repeat that but again we know what drives the value of a business or an asset it's cash flows growth and risk it's always been true now you might use a discounted cash flow model and make estimates of those and there we can have room for disagreement but the value of a business always comes from cash flows growth at risk that's what drives value you know what drives price demand and supply they think our demanded Supply driven by cash flows growth and risk they could be but they could also be driven by mood and momentum and revenge seek revenge early 2021 I think it was January 2021 this company called GameStop company that's actually a dying business because who goes into a mall in the first place anymore and who goes into a game in the business selling games in the in a more but that's their Core Business and people bet on the fact that it was a dying business would go to zero it's one of the most shorted stocks on the New York Stock Exchange stock had dropped from like forty dollars down to eleven twelve thirteen dollars when in January 2021 something very unusual and strange occurred a group of people gathered together on Reddit and created the site called Wall Street bets and they decided that they were going to buy GameStop and push the price up and did they succeed you know what GameStop stock price went to right and anybody know what its high was it actually got to 450 dollars they made GameStop into a I think a hundred million dollar company and I said what do they see that I don't what is it that they see in the business models have went on Wall Street bets don't go to that rabbit hole it's very difficult to extract yourself and I start looking for what's the story they're telling and you know what the overwhelming emotion was that was driving people to buy it wasn't that they thought the company had a great business model there were a few mentions of Ryan Cohn from Chewie coming into the company maybe online gaming but the overwhelming reason they were buying is because they wanted to take revenge against whom hedge funds why because they're big student loans and they said it's a hedge fund's fault you need somebody to blame and they said this is who we're going to blame we're going to push the price up to teach them a lesson and I think this is good this is bad but price is what it is you think but that's not rational in fact isn't Revenge the most human if you think about strong emotions Revenge versus rational evaluation revenge is going to win out every single time price is driven by cash flows growth and risk but it's driven by mood and momentum and in finance we've known this for 50 years right there's an entire branch of Finance that's dedicated to the idea that there are all these behavioral forces that drive how people react it's called behavioral Finance behavioral Finance doesn't affect the value of a company but it can affect the price it can drive the price away from the value and keep it away from the value for long periods foreign look at the business model you get the cash flows growth and if you're asked to price something you know what you do you look at what other people are paying for similar things hey when you buy a house think of how you decide how much to pay you don't do a discounted cash flow valuation of the house I don't think you look at what other people paid for that's pricing do people do something similar in equity markets how do most equity research analysts decide with something is cheaper expensive they look at the PE ratio for the company they compared to 15 other companies say look this company is cheaper this company's expense they're doing pricing using the word valuation to describe what you've just done when you've used a multiple and comparable this is malpractice it needs to stop it will not but it needs to stop because it creates all kinds of strange misconceptions about that so when a company goes from 400 per share to twenty dollars per share it's not that the value probably collapse the pricing collapse let's be clear about what's happening so we're going to spend a big chunk of this class document back because that's where my heart lies but we're also going to spend about a third of this class talking about doing pricing better because most of you if you end up in jobs that you think of valuation jobs really are pricing jobs Bankers price companies are not value companies equity research analyst price companies that are value companies so we're going to talk about how to do pricing better because I think that it's my job to make sure that that tool set is available to you because you can't be using a discounted cash flow model if your job is to price six now what are we going to Value just about everything this is not a class about value large publicly traded companies it's about valuing small publicly traded companies not a class about valuing U.S companies alone it's about value companies anywhere in the globe it's not even about value public companies it's about value private companies in fact it might not even about valuing companies at all it might be valuing individual assets or even Investments and along the way we're going to argue that there are some things that cannot be bad why because they don't have cash flow what's the value of Picasso I have absolutely no idea what's the price of a Picasso well I can look at what other people pay for picassos and they can judgment on what you pay for percussion already you can see that somebody asks you is Bitcoin undervalued they've lost the script Bitcoin cannot be valued it's a currency if it's a currency if it's a collectible it's still got to be valued but either way when you think about a currency you can't value the US dollar you can price it in fact what do we call that pricing an exchange rate you can think about the price of Bitcoin as an exchange rate between dollars and Bitcoin and along the way if we get a chance you'll ask is that a reasonable exchange rate what am I getting when I have Bitcoin instead of dollars it's a healthier discussion than going on a rabbit hole saying let's value for cars so let's value Bitcoin so we're going to talk about pricing things like Collectibles maybe even real estate which is an entirely pricing game nobody values real estate how do real estate developers come up with the value to pay for the property they might put in cash flows from rental income but at the end what did they do they estimate what they could sell the building to somebody else for with a pricing judgment and finally I told you that valuation we've got story people in this room and numbers people in this room and I know right now there are numbers person you might say I feel more comfortable this is my turf we're going to work with numbers and if a shorter person is saying what exactly am I going to do here and I'm going to argue that a good valuation is a bridge between stories and numbers are you talking about when I show you evaluation of a company let's take Tesla you know how much I projected as revenues for Tesla in 2032. anybody's right my blog 400 billion dollars we asked me how did I come up with the 400 billion here's the answer you don't want to hear but I told you I used to 25 growth rate for the first five years 21 in year six it answers nothing right it tells you nothing when I use a 400 billion dollar revenue for Tesla I'm making I'm telling you a story of Tesla becoming not just the largest car company in the world because remember Toyota and Volkswagen have what 280 billion revenues but also having revenue streams from other businesses software carbon offsets they made 1.8 billion from carbon offsets last year maybe AI maybe you know automated driving but I'm telling a story about a company it's going to be incredibly successful I'm also telling a story about people increasingly switching from traditional Autumn appeals to electric vehicles around the world and that's what I need to tell you that's a story when you see the margins for Tesla the margins I estimated for 16 and you should be skeptical you know what no car company makes 16 margins car companies make eight even the very best car companies make eight nine ten percent margins I said why is it 16 percent the story I'm telling about Tesla is a company that's not just I'm I'm telling you a story of an electric car not just being a car but more electronic device more iPhone than car because that basically allows you to have higher margins could I be wrong on both absolutely but that's a story that we can then debate you can say I disagree with that story but it's quite only used to 25 growth rate how do you disagree I'll use a 30 growth rate and that's a completely unhealthy discussion good valuations of bridges between stories and numbers so when I show you a number I always have to have a story that backs it up and when you tell me a story about a company I'm going to put you on the spot say where does it show up in the numbers so you tell me your company has incredibly good management so where does it show up in the numbers yesterday I got somebody who didn't like my valuations the way you showing the mind-blowing capacity that Elon Musk has to come up with new products say look I can't play paid dividends with mind-blowing capacities I've got to convert it into new products and new revenue streams why do you think I'm making Tesla one of the most successful companies in the world over the next 10 years so when people talk about that's too subjective it's too qualitative it cannot be put into evaluation then don't pay for it because when you pay for evaluation do you pay with real dollars or with mind-blowing explosions or whatever you brought it you got to pay with real money so if you want to buy a company like palette like Tesla you have no you have the obligation then to try to bring all of those factors in I told you it started as a number crunch for the first few years I taught this class I taught it as a number cruncher did which is when in doubt put up an equation you stood that we'll put up a second equation if the doubt lingers make them simultaneous equations software and make you feel a lot better it accomplishes nothing took me a while to realize that if I wanted to act on my valuation that's going to be the next theme I'm going to talk about I needed to be able to tell stories and then teach myself storytelling and one of the things I will try to during the class is take you through the process of how I try to connect stories numbers it's not the process that might work for you but it's really about bringing in your weak side I'll tell you my end game for this class by the end of this class if you're a Storyteller I hope you get comfortable enough with numbers that you can tell discipline stories the storytellers tend to kind of wander off right they make up very dead because there's nothing crippling I hope you develop enough discipline to tell discipline stories if you're a number cruncher here's what I hope this class will deliver that you will get to trust your imagination enough that you're willing to tell stories let your imagination go to me the essence of somebody's good at Value you're either a disciplined Storyteller or an imaginative number cruncher guess which group I have trouble with every single semester I teach this class getting storytellers to develop discipline on number crunches to let loose their imaginations always a number of questions you give me a hundred history majors I can teach them enough valuation to be able to add companies in a week give me a hundred Engineers I'm screwed you know why you've spent a lifetime bludgeoning your imagination to the ground because you've been told at every step that being telling a story without tying up every loose end is a sign of weakness and I want you to kind of let loose on that it you know it won't come naturally you're going to feel uncomfortable because all these loose ends are going to be out there but you got to get comfortable with that part of the process if you truly want to Value companies which brings me my final theme I'm going to use a word that you probably did not expect an evaluation class the word I'm going to use is the word faith he said what's Faith Got to Do with It you know what I don't do valuation Consulting I've never valued a company for money I don't do expert witness work in courts where you come in and say the value so I I don't do it not because I'm Noble because I'm too lazy and too opinionated and I don't want to do it but it does mean it leaves me with this vacuum of why exactly am I value companies I value companies because I want to act on my valuations you know what I mean by that right if I value a company and I find it undervalued I want to be able to buy the stock they're saying what's the big deal think about it let's say you know you pick the company you pick you value the company you come up with the value of 50 the stock price is at 35. this is a no-brainer right just go buy the stock but what might hold you back first you have to have faith in the evaluation and by then you're going to realize how many assumptions you had to make to get to the fifty dollars and you're gonna say well I don't know whether I'm right and then you have to have faith that the price will adjust to Value right the 35 has to go to 50. you see why is the word fake what's the essence of faith if you ask me to prove that your value is Right revise you to prove the values right there is no way you can do it if I if you ask me to prove that price will move to Value I can't do that either now do you see why it's so difficult for people to actually use valuation investing value companies it's difficult to develop Faith because it doesn't happen overnight that's one thing I can't teach in this class I can take you through the process of how I got my faith and all it can also take you to the process of when my faith has been tested I've always been uncomfortable with the Alma Hub you have invested which is absolute right if you do it right away you're going to make money I've never felt that that that absolutely sure about anything which means my faith gets tested I'll give you a very simple example I value Tesla on that thing a week ago right before it's a links report but actually as the earnings report came out the value it came up with was 130 stock was trading at 143 there you know what the stock is trading at right now 172 right now it's a market knocking on my desk do you still have faith that's what's going to happen you buy a stock you think it's undervalued and the stock price drops even more that's a market knocking on your door saying do you still have faith and don't tell me that you feel absolutely sure about it because there's something wrong with you if that's the case it's natural if you have faith for that Faith to be tested and sometimes it's okay to say I don't feel faithful enough to my evaluation to hold on because that's a healthy reaction as well in investing so let's talk about the preseason prep it's too late for preseason so The Season's already here now but if your accounting is weak your statistics is weak your foundations of finances week I discovered very early that just because you took a class in accounting or a class in statistics doesn't mean you got quite get it so I created my own versions of these classes and they're very skewed versions because it's all about what do I need in my valuation classroom statistics from accounting so don't show this to the accounting professor because he's probably going to freak out saying that's not right I don't care this is about accounting from my perspective in valuations about reading accounting statements and making sure that you do this right now so if you're if you find yourself at stages of this class finding yourself not quite sure what the difference is between you know total assets and invested capital I would strongly encourage you to take the accounting class or at least pieces of it to make sure your accounting is on so it's completely optional again and if you feel that it'll help you go ahead and do it over the next 15 weeks I am going to torture you pretty much every day for the next 15 weeks you're going to hear from me and I'll tell you how these weeks will play out Monday right after the class so today you know around 5 or 5 15 you get an email and all I'll do is say this is what we did in class today you're saying but I was in class it doesn't matter I was just to remind you what we did in class today perhaps give you a couple of links in case you're interested and there will be a post-class tested solution basically it's a 10 minute test you can take to see did I get what we recovered in class today on Tuesday you get the valuation of the week so tomorrow expect an email with my Tesla valuation my Tesla blog post and the Google shared spreadsheet and I will encourage you to use my spreads to change the numbers you don't like and so don't and moan that you don't like my growth rate you don't like my margin just make it yours come up with the value put it on the Google shed spreadsheet on Wednesday you like class again and the email that will be sent out Wednesday in addition to the post-class testing solution there'll be a weekly chat it's completely optional but basically take the material we did that week in class and take an extra step so we talk about risk free rates next week I might ask you to estimate a risk free rate in Egyptian pounds it's quite a challenge but this is really to hey do you get this can you extend this one more step it's not just mechanical on Thursday I will nag you nag you about what a project that will run all the way through the semester that I'll talk about in a few minutes who you value company the nag is going to be but where are you on the project it's essentially to make you keep moving on the project most of you will not listen and do it all in the last two weeks but nothing I can do about it on Friday I'll send you what I call evaluation tools of the week those of you in my corporate finance class or I did a separate set of sessions on in practice webcast but the valuation tools of the week I'll basically take whatever we did that week and talk about hey practically if I to estimated risk-free rate in Indonesian Rupiah where would I get the data how would I use the data so basically taken to the mechanics of doing something on Saturday you get an email with the newsletter on what we did during the course of the week you said why would I need a newsletter it just happened but large classes especially as you go through the semester there are going to be times that I have no idea what we did last week or where we're going so the newsletter will tell you on Saturday Sunday I will send you the solution to the weekly channel the weekly challenge I said is optional you don't have to turn it in anywhere so I really don't no don't keep track of who's doing it it's up to you but I'll send you the solution you can compare to your solution and see you know why the answers might be different then Monday you wake up and we'll repeat the process over and over again I'll give you a break during spring break I would email you for that week but outside of that week every day you're pretty much going to get an email from me and if you don't get an email from me then you should start thinking about maybe there's something wrong with my email I'm not getting emails in because you know that's unusual now in terms of books you don't need any textbooks for this class you can use the lecture notes I've sent you the link to the first packet there will be two more packets coming yeah but if you do want to get a book I have five books on valuation there'll be a sixth book coming out during the course of the semester there's only one of these that's a textbook investment valuation It's a Grind it's big it's you know it's it's involved in practice problems so it's good for a class in terms of but it's tough It's a tough read I I don't want to read it you know start to finish no but I also have a book called The Modern evaluation which is more for practitioners if you really like to value difficult to Value companies okay I have called Dark Side evaluation about value young companies commodity companies financial service companies regulated companies so basically when you think about difficult to Value companies if you really don't have time to read and you want something cheap there's a little book evaluation and it's really little kind of covers what I do in the other books in like 200 pages of thousand pages and if you're really focused in on the story to numbers part of evaluation then I will go follow narrative with numbers there'll be a sixth book that'll show up sometime during the semester on the corporate life cycle with the printer it's going to come from random house so I'll tell you when it's available about how to Value companies all the way from Young all the way into the cloud okay if you have an Apple device I also have an app called you value on the app store which does an entrance evaluation so if you have an iPad or an iPhone you know you can download it it actually 15 inputs will do an entrance evaluation and I'll put it up against any banking valuation of a company it does a pretty good job but it does come with the money back guarantee you know I it's free which means you don't like it stuff you know I don't care now return the money you paid which is zero so so think of it as something as an add-on that you can use if you if you if you kind of want to see what looks and in terms of you know in terms of staying connected much of the stuff almost everything in this class the basic platform you should use is not bright space or a learning management system it's the web page for the class I've sent you the link multiple times it's up there as well so it'll have links to everything the lectures the webcast the practice problems past exams everything yeah the sessions will be we'll have a zoom link the zoom link of course creates a recording I'll put the recordings up I do convert the recordings also into YouTube videos sounds like Overkill but the advantage of YouTube is it kind of adjust your bandwidth so if you're in an airport and you have to watch a lecture and catch up it's very difficult to download an mp4 file if you're on on Airport Wi-Fi but YouTube adjusts to bandwidth so you can watch it much more easily and uh every email I send in this class will go into this thing called the email Chronicle this is really for myself because there will be times in this class we're going to say I never got that email how do you disprove something like that so here's what I'm going to do instead I'm going to put everything into the email Chronicles which means you have no reason for not being aware of what's going on in the class so every email and it'll build up right now it's only three emails because that's all I've said but it'll build up over the course of the class to become you know 20 pages long because that's what 114 emails will do to you now piling on there's a Google Calendar you can check out what the quizzes are there'll be three quizzes and a final and I'll talk about that in a little while now if you want more reading as I said much of what I do in real time goes on my blog so right now as you know the Twitter post is up there I'm just going to post this evening on what interest rates are in 2022 so it's kind of a framework for thinking about interest rates and sometime in the next week I want to write about this Indian company called the adani group which is in the news right now because it's been targeted by a short seller called Hindenburg it's a huge story even if you're not from India because it is one of India's largest companies in terms of market cap and because of the short selling story it lost 50 billion dollars in market cap on Friday and I want I know nothing about the insights of the company but I want to talk about holding companies and if you wrote on family group holding companies family group holding companies with light floor and family group holding companies with light float and political connections why do you have a surprise that bad things can happen to you because you in a sense loaded the dice here to everything that can make things go wrong something is going to go wrong so keep your eye on the blog because almost everything you read There is relevant to this class yeah not Twitter feed I I don't involve myself in Twitter fights Twitter battles the Twitter feed is really there to direct you to something I've already done a blog posts a paper that I've written a new spreadsheet that I put up and finally if you still have time in your hands I don't see how you could have that there are more readings that you can find on the web page for the class I know you're all really focused still on grades and you know this class like every other finance class has to follow a grading I mean the other disciplines might not so strategy marketing might do whatever they want but we have a requirement that people so I'm going to follow the same principles about A's and B's and C's but here's what I'm looking for now if you can value just about anything by the end of this class then I'm looking to give you an ad if you can value most things and a b if you can value something which is not asking for much then you're a c and if you can value nothing at the end of the class and I've really screwed up and you've screwed up with me yeah which effectively means I've got to create a mechanism for coming up with that distinction here's what I will use there will be three quizzes for this class that are you know that that run through the semester and you can see the dates they're open book open Notes this is not about testing you or do you remember an equation from page 73 it's about applying what we do in class and every quiz and exam I've ever given an evaluation class is online so which means I've got to come up with an entirely new quiz so don't use chat GPT to answer the quiz because we look at the old quiz it do the wrong thing because all I have to do is throw one little branch in there it's going to screw it up so essentially it's open book open notes and you'll have as much practice as you want because every pass quiz is them there will be a final exam in the week after class n so it could be the final exam week I don't know the exact date yet because I haven't specified it the quizzes will be 10 percent each and the final exam will be 30 percent and when you get a chance read through the next page because it lists out the rules for quizzes I'll cut through to the basic rules it's open book open Notes but it's your book your notes not the next person's exam in case that needed to be you know needed to be stated but it also tells you what happens if you miss a quiz because there will be reasons to miss a quest there better be good reasons right you're sick but stuck on the subway your spouse is like a child is sick your dog is sick and you know what I'm not good to come in and check it so if you tell me you're sick I don't want a doctor's note because I will assume you're an adult I'm an adult you're not lying to me about this but if you do miss a quiz yes what's going to happen the 10 gets moved to the remaining quizzes and the final it's always going to get moved forward you know why because otherwise you get strategic Christmas which is if you do really what are the first two quizzes you miss the third quiz because it makes your quizzes worth more and I've played this game long enough to know the gaming that goes on so it'll always get pushed into what's left so there is really no strategically good reason to miss a quiz you know so if you can take the quiz I would suggest you do now I will as when I do open book open notes that used to be that I prevented electronic devices but many of you will have your slides on a device it could be an iPad it might be even on your laptop I will let you access the slides but no Excel spreadsheets it's for your own protection because if I let you use Excel spreadsheets I'm going to up the game on the kinds of problems I'm going to ask you and trust me you don't want to go there and I don't want to go there so let's keep Excel out of the picture now and essentially you can use the slides and you can use a calculator you can use a calculator on your device whatever you want to do so so that's basically everything about the class let me very quickly talk a little bit about the project so what's the project project basically is going to force you to pick a company and both value it at price it by now you know the distinction so we're going to make your value pricing now it's a group project and I'm going to let you find your own groups I'm not going to be responsible for any of the group issues that come up you know so this way you pick the group you handle the group you deal with intra group dynamics I don't have the bandwidth to be able to do that now each of you will pick a company to Value let me be specific so the groups can range anywhere from four people to seven even eight people I'm okay with that but if you have seven people in the group there will be seven companies being valued four people in the group there'll be four companies being bad now in my corporate finance class the project is due on the last day of class and I kind of let it go because people work on their own timing in this class we have this small problem many how many of you are second year mbas okay this is phenomenon called premature graduation which usually means around March mentally already left the school so which means that after that nobody can nail you down on anything on a project so what I'm going to do is Midway through the semester I'm going to give you a one-time deal it's March 31st on your intrinsic valuation part you can turn in your valuation for feedback it's not for grading so that's really to encourage you to get working on the valuation early rather than later now what are you going to do in the project first when you click companies within a group I'm going to put some constraints across the group at least one of your companies has to be money losing trust me that's not tough to find now so lots of money losing companies you can pick any you know at least one to be money elusive at least one of your companies have to have high growth in terms of Revenue not income growth but Revenue growth that's to get you valuing the palantirs of the world and even the Teslas of the world saying High Revenue growth at least one of your companies has to be a non-us company and I'd prefer you value the company in the local currency if you want to pick a Nigerian company in value in Nigeria naira that's exactly what I want to do because I want you to get comfortable value companies in different currencies in different markets and at least what if your companies be a Service Company might as well cross that requirement out because 90 of the word is service companies now that's easy now remember one company can meet multiple constraints do you see how you can have a money losing high growth Emerging Market company so if you've got say let's say you founded a group and there's some new person who wants to join in one way you can you can create bargaining power you can say look you can join the group but you got to Value the high growth money losing Emerging Market company because let's face it it is more difficult to do it so if your objective is to minimize your work you might avoid that company but if you really want to learn valuation that's basically where you should go right so you're going to do an intrinsic valuation of your company and we'll we'll develop the tools over the course of the seven eight nine weeks the first seven eight weeks where you do this so by the time you get to March 31st you're going to turn an entrancy valuation of economy that intrinsic value can be higher or lower than the price your company can be under over that once you're done with that though I'm going to ask you to price your company do you think what's the difference there pricing your company you're going to look at other companies in the sector and saying you know pick a multiple and comfortable you're going to price your company when you price your company you might find it to be underpriced or overpressed ready to dress Market I also had these market-wide pricing mechanisms where you can say hey my company's underpriced relative software companies let's see how it's doing against the U.S market so you're going to price the company again tomorrow so at this point you're gonna have three numbers in your company an intrinsic valuation for your company a pricing against a sector and a pricing against a marketing so what last step in this process uh oh actually there's a fourth number you might get for some of your companies where I'm going to argue that some companies with contingent cash flows a young pharmaceutical company with a drug working its way through the pipeline an oil company with undeveloped reserves the reserves are all very expensive to develop you have an option it's a very small subset of your companies you might get a fourth number for your company an option pricing value for your company at this stage you might be mystified so what if I'm getting four different numbers the final step of this class of this project you're going to I'm going to ask you to make a recommendation and I'm going to give you two choices buy or sell no Weasley stuff no strong buy Weak by semi-strong by feel really uncomfortable you either buy or sell some of you are going to be chicken and pick the hold and I'm going to let you do it but I'm gonna try to push you off that hook now do you see why I emphasize the point they're going to get four different numbers what if you find your company to be undervalued when you need your intrinsic valuation but overpressed or overvalued and underpressed see what do I do you get to pay pick what pick which of those numbers you feel more comfortable with there is no theoretical answer are you more comfortable with your pricing or evaluation so that project is going to run all the way through I want you to start thinking about groups you want to be part of and companies you would like to value pick a company that fascinates you don't pick a company because it's going to make your life easy pick a company that you've always wanted to get a number on it it could be Tesla it could be beyond meat it could be Lulu Lamont don't ask me what the fascination of that damn company maybe every semester there are eight people valueing Lululemon about six people used to Value Krispy Kreme 10 people is I think you know what happens people sit on the couch they're watching Netflix they're eating Krispy Kreme Donuts so what should I value they look at the box next and the Krispy Kreme looks good whatever the reason pick a company that you feel you would like to get a value for right this is not about the number that I'm going to use it's the number you're going to use and that's going to be the project for the class as I said it's going to run through the semester it's going to be 40 of your overall grade so something to think about as you go through this class which gets me started on the first lecture not package the first lecture not package the introductory packet is 22 Pages I'm going to set the table what the class is going to be about no I I know when I first started the class I did not ask you why you were taking the class because some people think you know they but learning valuation they're going to get rich some people think by learning valuation they can go work for an investment Bank you know I'm going to tell you why I do valuation when I first started teaching valuation I made the mistake of assuming that everybody else was as interested in valuation as I was huge mistake in hindsight because most people have discovered don't care that much about valuation they don't believe in valuation even people who do valuation for a living but they do it all the time they do it because it's their job but if you ask them in an honest moment why is Tesla trading at 172 their answers because that's what the market thinks it's worth if that's what I believed I couldn't teach this class so I'll tell you why do valuation I'll tell you why I do valuation I do valuation to fight the levy for a deadline they became famous or inFAMOUS in the 1950s when National Geographic or Disney nobody's quite sure the parentage of this movie that was made about Lennox the thousands of big ugly rat-like creatures gathered together on a cliff run right off the cliff into an ocean and commit Collective suicide I get about 100 emails right after I do this session telling me this is mythology I don't care it's good mythology it's a good story go with them I wanted to think about why they do it why do they run off the clips could see why the first lemming did it right he was going too fast he couldn't stop goes off the cliff into the ocean incidentally these guys can't swim that kind of seems the deal dead second guy too close the first guy also dead but I'd like you to put yourself in the shoes of the very last lemming in that group I know Lemmings don't wear shoes but can I hang in there with the analogy anyway you're running as fast as you can towards a cliff you've seen your entire tribe disappear up that Cliff you have second thoughts about what you were just planning to do right left brain right brain whatever stop stop don't do it and then he heard this voice in the back of your head and you know what it said they must know something that you don't remember those seven words to the seven most deadly words in investing evaluation I remember valuing Tesla in November of 2021 at the peak of its Glory you know what the market cap for Tesla was November of 2021 1.2 trillion dollars it had quadrupled in price over the previous year and had gone up like 12-fold over the previous two years it's trading by twelve hundred dollars per share first time I valued the company I came up with three hundred dollars per share and then I heard this voice in the back of my head they must know something that you don't speaks in a monitor don't ask me why but you know those words magical things start to happen with the evaluation your growth rates start to nudge up your discount rates start to go down your cash flows start to get bigger it's almost like your spreadsheet it's taken on a life of its own and it's trying to move the value towards but if you don't believe me you're going to go through this when you value your company you're going to come up with a value different price it's almost like unconsciously you start moving numbers till you get where until you get close to the price it's the safest place to be actually it's human nature in fact you can divide the word of investors in three groups first group I call proud learnings I'm a lemming and I'm proud to be a living they call themselves momentum investors but that's what they do right what do momentum investors do they look for a crowd they join and you're buying on by it you're selling I'm selling why are you buying I really don't care the second group of lemmings I call Yogi Bear lemmings I used to read Yogi Bear comics when I was a kid and Yogi Bear was lived in I think Yellowstone Park was this domicile but he was smarter than the average bear Yogi Bear living let me think they're smarter than the average living you know what they want to do they want to run with the crowd to the very edge of the cliff and then Veer away great if you could pull it off ready to get all the upside you're tempted you're saying I came for an MBM smarter than the average investor you might be but I'm not I'm not I can't pull off being a proud living I'm not smarter than the average living I have no idea where the cliff is coming in hindsight I can tell you where it happened if you ask me to describe myself that's me lemming with the life vest that's all I can aspire to be that's what valuation gives you it gives you a life vest it gives you something else to hold on to when everybody else changes their mind it slows the process down for me I do valuation not because it's going to make me rational I cannot be rational because human beings are incapable of being rational but it slows the process down gives my rational side a chance to mount an argument nine times out of ten you know what I'm going to do I'm going to ignore it and do whatever I want it in the first place but maybe that one time out of ten it'll bring me to my senses what I hope to do is throw you that life Fest by the end of this class you can ignore it it's still some out in the middle of the ocean without a life faster but it's good to have to like first even if you're going with the crowd might as well have a life Fest and then go with the crowd and watch the rest of them ground so when we start the next class we're going to talk about what I call the Bermuda Triangle evaluation three biggest reasons why valuations go off the tracks and none of them have to do with getting cash flows right at the beta right of the cost of capital right but I'll see you on Wednesday and uh get ready for the email after class today and another email tomorrow and maybe another email before class on Wednesday oh yeah 
foreign thank you okay folks hey so today's uh in today's session I'm going to lay the groundwork before it's coming now set the table but before I do that I want to identify what I think are the three biggest reasons valuations go off the tracks and none of the reasons none of the reasons have anything to do with Can you estimate cash flows can you get a bait error cost of equity or cost of capital so I'm going to start today's session with a test on how biases and preconceptions can drive your valuation so residential value company anybody who picked a company to Value already come on somebody must have made a choice already anybody pick a company don't worry I'm not going to push you on the choice I just want to know that you picked a company who are you going to value and then company called fire department and why did you pick the company well but now okay so is it because it's uh do you value it because it's an Innovative company or because it's going through trouble now it's the news and you worry you're wondering okay anybody else pick a company yes top stories and why did you pick the company oh innovating and having a hard time right now yeah anybody else no Nestle no Netflix's Teslas Facebooks when you pick a company remember it's not on a blank slate right you already come in with prayers about the company this doesn't make you a bad person it is the way we're structured so I'm going to call this the power of the subconscious which is when you pick a company already have a point of view of the company it might be that you like the company you dislike the company that you think it's a good company or a bad company okay and sometimes that comes from things that you don't even realize are working in the back of your head I'll give you a personal example I valued Microsoft every year from 1986 all the way through today but between 1986 and 2014. every time I value Microsoft I found it to be overpatched you name the price over that over value two dollars five dollars ten dollars strange right one of the great success stories of U.S Equity markets of the 20th century I wouldn't have touched it one step of the way now I could give you access to every single valuation of Microsoft I've done over the last 20 something years you could dig through the numbers looking for Clues as to why I found it to be overvalued but you'll be looking in the wrong place to understand why I found Microsoft to be overvalued just go over to the next building take the elevator up to the ninth floor walk to kmac 969 which is my office the door is open don't take anything out right now because I'm teaching them but walk in and take a look around here's what you're going to see you're going to see my MacBook Pro to my left you're going to see my Apple display to the right my iPhone is with me because I need it right here but my iPad is next to me my earbuds are right there I'm an Apple user I've been an Apple user since 1981 in fact if you look towards the top shelf I have my very first Mac 128k those of you don't remember this was the very first Macintosh it came without a hard drive it came with a floppy drive and everything had to go back and forth I'm an Apple user and to me Microsoft has always been the Darth Vader of Technology for those of your Star Wars fans let me be specific about which Darth Vader I'm talking I'm not talking Anakin Skywalker cute little kid Darth Vader I'm talking episodes four five and six the guy dresses in black never takes a shower talks in that strange voice lots of bad thoughts about Bill Gates and they all come bubbling up to the surface from her value Microsoft because in valuation you come to Forks in the road high growth or low growth high risk or low risk you get to pick you make choices and your choices will reflect those preconceptions so whether you like it or not you're not starting with a blank slate you're already a prayers about the company and sometimes the power of suggestion adds up I'll send you my Tesla valuation yesterday now when you some of you I know there are like 32 people who value the company some of you might have put your numbers down there I would love to tell you to ignore what I've done no I didn't say that because I know that's pointless because you can look at what I've done and whether you like it or not it is going to affect your valuation and sure I once ran an experiment where I took the same company at that time I used to make people value IPOs in class I took the same company I was teaching two sections of evaluation gave them the same information and in one class I didn't specify prices come up with the best offering price in the other class I said and take all these numbers oh by the way people think that a rough price of 20 to 25 is a reasonable price but ignore what I just said and then after the two classes came back with their IPO evaluations I put up histograms the first class the histogram was around what some number 37 38 whatever it was the second class magically the histogram had shifted to between 20 and 25 dollars I talked to managing directors many of them are old students of mine I don't do any m a work but one of the things I tell them is when you give your T evaluation assignment for God's sakes don't throw a number in there say oh by the way it's I think it's roughly a hundred dollars and because if you do that it is going to affect the numbers you get back so bias comes from what you've read about a company the more you know about a company then the more bias there is going to be in your valuation it's one of the downsides of getting familiar with the company but here's I think the wild card if you get paid to do a valuation stop talking about being objective because you tell me who pays you and how much you get paid I'll tell you which direction the bias is and how much the buyers when I tell this to appraise us they Blanche and say but we're objective where scientific stop lying at least be honest with yourselves that if you're getting paid to do evaluation it is going to affect evaluation So today we're going to talk about how bias plays out like to show you how being paid for evaluation can affect your valuation now there's about 30 years ago the company called lint cable so obviously a cable company that time a t had this option to buy 51 of Lin cable at an appraised value Lin cable was a publicly traded company the option was written in terms of appraised value so time for the option to be exercised comes about and at T goes out and hires Morgan Stanley at that time their their the Investment Bank they used for everything and they said hey value the 51 percent of blend cable so we can buy it so you guys are going to be Morgan Stanley going to assess the value of the 51 of Lynn cables so a t can buy do you work for the buyer Lynn cable went out and hired Lehman Brothers I'm sorry to do this to you but think of yourself as pre-bankrupt Lehman Brothers and you're assessing the value of the same 51 for the seller same company same point in time same financial information two teams go to one one comes back with 155 dollars per share the other comes back at 105 dollars per share I want you to guess which side came back with 105 and which side came back with 155 any guesses who came back to the 105 dollars per share because that's your job coming to the low ball number of course it's backed up by a 300 page valuation report assumption scenarios Etc and you came back with 155 because you worked for the seller you both did your jobs in fact the difference is so large they decide to call the third Investment Bank why settle for two fees when you can have three I guess and they call in this outfit called Washington State let me say something incredibly harsh about these guys but I mean every word of it these guys couldn't value a twenty dollar bill in a brown paper bag if you put in front of them single-handedly this outfit brought down the practice evaluation about six notches in the 1980s and 90s I talk a lot more about Bruce Washington and Joe perella later in the class but these guys invented multiples that basically nobody'd seen before they pushed EB to epider multiples of front we come back and talk about good and bad reasons but if you're watching steam perella you're right in the middle here right you don't want to piss off either side too much it's a financial term because you got to work with both sides in the future 105 155 was the safest place for you to be right down the middle 130 right they came back with 127 dollars and 50 cents I won't let you in on a little secret evaluation if you're ever asked to Value something never ever ever ever come back with a nice round number don't tell me the Target price is 40. tell me it's 38.87 it's amazing what that second decimal will do in terms of creating an illusion that you actually know more than you do it's not that people are bad people it's that once the motive becomes once money drives the motor whether you like it or not you're going to find ways of getting here's an additional source of vibes you sit around the value of company if you already own a thousand shares of the company it already colors your valuation if you sold short it colors your valuation people often talk about you know whether you have skin in the game last week when I valued Tesla I think you know somebody I don't know who it was Ross Gerber maybe I said he has no skin in the game and I said If by skin in the game you mean I don't own three Teslas and a half my wealth tied up intestly you're absolutely right that's not skin and again that's your whole body in the game you better win that game or you're dying but when you talk about skin in the game you got to be careful that you don't have so much skin in the game that you can't step back and be objective so what I'd like to do is take you through a series of tests and I wanted to just do something very simple in each case I'm going to paint the scenario and I'd like you to tell me in this scenario where they're going to be biased up or bias down but they're going to push the value up so you ready you're a Founder you've started a business very promising business you decide to Value it for yourself is your bias to come up with a high value or a low value I'm sorry all right right that's the easy one your adventure capital is looking at the same company thinking about investing your money you know how the Venture Capital process works I Supply Capital you could be a share of your company is my bias going to be to come up with a high value or a low value when was the last time on Shark Tank that Kevin O'Leary said oh you want a million I'll give you five and what are the mechanisms we use to adjust the value if it's uh startup you're going to overestimate revenues expand the profitability tell me the total Market is 5 billion not 500 million I'm going to push in the other direction and I want trump card in my hand that I can use to lower your value it's a made-up number that people call it discount rate but it's called a Target rate basically the Venture Capital says I need to make 50 who comes up with this stuff you know what the advantage of using the 50 is right whatever number you come up with I'm going to knock off 50 a year very quickly I come up with a low number let's move on let's say you've started a business you become successful you got married and now you're getting divorced and your ex soon to be ex-spouse is going to get half the value of your business you hire an appraiser to Value business you value to yourself is your bias to come up with a really big number so you can give half of that really big number to your spouse a really small number thank you I'm a terrible business person this business is probably worth nothing half of nothing is nothing take nothing let's keep going you're hard and Appraisal to Value business but now it's for tax purposes the tax authorities are going to take away 30 percent of what the appraised value of your business is going to be again you could say you want to come up with a low number and if an appraiser comes up with a high numbers use too high a growth rate you know my margins are terrible I'll never make money my competition is going to kill me and if you're the IRS pushing to the other direction you're going to push in the other direction again it's a fact of life to ignore it I think doesn't make it go away let's move on you guys know how equity research is structured if South Side equity research and buy side equity research anybody want to tell me the difference between sell side equity research and buy-site equity research what do cell sat equity research analysts do where do they work and what makes them different from buy side equity research yes uh sell side usually uh best banks and South Side institutions and then they produce research hedge funds bonds and so forth kind of essentially to like a pitch and what's a business model do they get paid for the research most of the time they don't it's actually a freebie and the way the Investment Bank makes money is they hope the client who uses your research directs their trading through your investment bank it's so it's a very strange because we'll come back and talk about how that might affect the business but in most cases when you look at cellside analysts you're right they tend to work for investment Banks they do research they pitch to clients and they're the people you will see on CNBC or Fox Business they're the analysts are out there because they get visible they work for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and by side equity research analysts toil away in dark roots or maybe lighted rooms but basically you don't see them very much they work for the fidelities of the T row prices they do research but the research is for internal consumption the research they do helps their portfolio managers decide what to buy and what to suck that's why they're not on CNBC their job is in time so let's focus on South Side equity research you're a cell site equity research analyst you're usually given a sector to track 15 20 25 companies and for the rest of your life this is the depressing part these companies you track these companies every day for the rest of your life unless you decide to quit you researcher companies you basically put buy or sell recommendations in the companies do you think in your case there might be a bias I mean this looks like it should be pretty objective right you would put that buy and sell recommendations is there a bias here you think to push values up or push values down and if so why yes who is your target group who you are trying to keep happy that's really the question right you're you're preparing This research for clients but the clients don't pay you work for an investment Bank so you need any trades to form something that has been done if you think about it the multiple groups right each has a different if you view this purely as a client service you're going to say my job is to deliver objective research and put buys on good companies and sales and bad companies right but let's play it through when you put a buyer recommendation what happens everybody's happy okay the company but the buy recommendation is happy because you know clearly investors buy the stock the bankers are happy because the the investment Banks because they might do other business with the company and now they have a good relationship even your clients for the moment are happy because there might be a front training effect when you get on CNBC and said this company is a good buy and go up two dollars at least for the moment let's figure out what happens when you put a cell recommendation put a cell recommendation plus what is what happens to your relationship with the company you had a journalist burning their sources you're doing something similar right if you think about where you get these rumors because remember they can't give you specific information but you are getting little pittances of information it comes from the company and once you put a cell recommendation guess what just shut out and remember you have to work with them for the next 27 years or the 28 years of your remaining equity research like the Investment Bank you work for might have had Corporate Finance consulting or a uh or a bond issue to the company they're not happy either because you know supposed to be Chinese walls but people climb over the walls through the walls I mean we know these Chinese Water Sports as heck you know my recommendations outnumber cell recommendations nine to one in fact Southside equity research analysts have created this really elaborate system of saying sell without ever saying sell I talked about strong buys semi-strong buys weak buys you know why they create the system right but Investment Bank says we've lowered this stock from a strong buy to a weak buy you know what you should hear Sell they can't say so cellside equity research has a bias upward because you've locked equity research analysts into relationship with companies and to preserve that they need to kind of have the best view of the company the most optimistic View let's keep going let's hear buy silence should be a little less problematic you don't have to keep investment Banks happy there's no other business but let's say the portfolio manager you work for owns a million shares of the stock you've been asked to assess so basically your job is tell them whether the stock is a good company to buy about no so you do your research you're going to his or her office what is the news that will get you a good reception that the company is a good company or a bad company you already own a million shares You're Expecting reaffirmation remember the Jack Nicholson line from A Few Good Men you don't know you can't handle the truth basically they can't handle if the truth is the stock is overvalued they don't want to hear it they want you to hear hey this is a good company whereas if they've sold short on those same companies they wanted to tell them that the action they've taken isn't I know this is not the way rational processes I suppose what but we're human beings bias is kind of impede how we think of that so let's talk about perhaps the most biased process on the face of the Earth the m a process let's talk about a friendly merger help me out in a friendly merger you have four people in the room you got the the choir the CEO or the management of the acquiring team the management of the target team the banker for the acquiring team the bank of the targeting so before we even look at bias is everybody in this room want this deal to go through it's a friendly merger right the acquiring Company CEO wants to go through because his ego is now connected I did the merger look I'm building an empire if you're Bob Iger do you want to be part of the vaccine there's 70 billion you're paying for Fox Park if you're the target firm CEO you want the deal to go through because it's a friendly merger the acquiring companies doing your premium you're probably getting a good golden parachute to walk away what about the bankers do you think they want the deal to go through God do they want the thief to God the deer doesn't go through how much they make absolutely nothing remember this this fee system you don't get paid for the hours you spend churning out spreadsheets so I want you to play the role of the banker for the acquiring fine you want the deal to go through right so what do you have to convince the acquiring firm share we remember this this is going to be used by the acquiring company CEOs to convince their shareholders and the board that this is in fact good for them so when you value the target company what do you have to show your shareholders that the value you're getting is going to be higher than the price you're paying for the Target companies what's a big deal I can do that let's go to the other side of the time transaction you're the target company Banker the target Company CEO has to convince his or her shareholders that the deal is good for them but for a deal to be good to them what has to happen the price they're getting is actually higher than them how the hell do you pull this off I'll give you the magic word synergy you see how Synergy makes both sides walk away because what the acquiring from Bankers would say is standing alone the company is not worth what we're paying but with the Synergy which you haven't put a number on but it's big really really big it's a good deal I'm going to say some caustic things about M A in general but one of the biggest reasons valuations in m a become almost pointless is the process is too biased the deal makers are the deal analysts who thought this was a good idea but that's become the standard practice right the bankers doing the deal I've told people look asking a banker whether a deal makes sense it's like asking a plastic surgeon when there's something wrong with your face what's the answer you're going to get you're perfect already it's incredible bias and if you have a hostile acquisition things get really messy because now you have two sides one side wants a deal to go through the other side doesn't you're going to be very careful about what you put out there because it can be used against you so if you did what you did as acquiring companies Banker before and put a value higher than the price and it got in the hands of the target company bankers and and management you know what they're going to do they're going to go to the conversation no don't salute look they told they're telling you they're paying too little there you might actually end up with two valuations one for internal use that your board uses and one for the rest of the world where you say you know what we're hostile acquisition valuations are a complete and total mess because it's more a strategic tool than it is evaluation a tool to use to negotiate and win this battle today's session I'm going to start with bias accept it as a given and talk about what do we do about it what you know if you're doing valuation you can't you you can't hide from it so what exactly is the right way so so the way I'm going to do this is basically talk about three broad misconceptions and valuation and how they play out in practice this is what we've been talking about so far that somehow evaluation is an objective search for the truth that we're sitting with numbers and working with numbers and therefore we're being objective Let It Go accept the fact that bias is here and if you're getting paid for the valuation bias is even more real my only advice is be honest with yourself here's my advice to you once you've picked the company you're going to value for this class on a piece of paper maybe just secretly to yourself or digitally Summers or get it erased at some point in time write down whether you think you're going to find your company under or overvalued over the course of the semester I know it sounds like you're doing things in the wrong sequence just put down your prize what do you think you're going to find I'll give you a very simple clue if you know if any of you choose to Value Tesla just one question what do you think of Elon Musk you like them you don't like them that's going to tell me what I'm going to find in the valuation and if you don't believe me we could do a matrix so what do you think about Elon Musk what do you think about Tesla I wager you get a one to one correspondence bias is part of life part evaluation in fact in statistics as a branch of Statistics called Bayesian statistic severe this Bayesian statistics here's what you're required to do before you do a study or a test you're supposed to put down on paper what your priors are what do you think you're going to find in that stand so before you do a study of what is the relationship between how much you drink and what your GPA is you're going to do a full-fledged study you say I think this is what I'm going to find in the study then you do the study you present the results and when you present the results you show about their priors and your results you see how that's going to be helpful right because when I look at your results I can then look at your priors and say you know what he was biased to find this so I'm going to Discount these results and if you're getting funded to do the research put that in as well because that's going to tell me which direction the bias is but over the last three years with Kobe think of all the crappy research that's hit us think of how much better off we'd have been if we'd known from the beginning you know when you look at research this is where this research is coming from this is what they're finding bias is a given you can't ignore it Midas will be open and honest about it put it down put down your prayers let's move on to the second big misconception about valuation if I do a good valuation I'm going to get the right answer when does this get started probably in first grade kindergarten to go to school teacher puts a sheet of paper in front of you three plus two you get five good job you got the right answer if you get any other answer you're told you got the wrong answer you must have done something wrong this gets drummed into you all the way through school if you go on to a quantitative degree in engineering uh Actuarial Sciences statistics this becomes second nature if I do things right I get the right answer but got the wrong answer I must have done something wrong there are some of you in this class who come from that background that you've been told if you got the wrong answer you must have done something wrong and I told you this is 59th and 60th semester I'm teaching evaluation every semester that I've taught this class about eight to ninth or tenth week somewhere towards the two-thirds part of the class a few people from the class maybe 15 or 20 people mostly engineers you know quantitative people show up with the valuation put it down matter I'm done with my valuation can you take a look and tell me whether I got the right answer I don't even look at the I just push it back across the table and say I don't know what the right answers you can see that faith in the system start to crack you're teaching this class you don't know what the right answer is to which my response is if I knew what the right value of every company was why would I be teaching this class I'd own my own island in Hawaii with a castle on top of it and half the people ask me this question or wonder about can't handle the fact that there is no right answer so you know what happens now they become fixed income it's so much more comfortable sitting there with a bond right maturity is given coupon you might not worry about default risk this is not this growth and margin all that crap floating around us it's healthy early on that equities are not for you go value buying I think they're incredibly boring but maybe boring is what stirs your straw as does your drink you can't stir a straw the other half see this is kind of fun if you don't know what the right answer is I can never ever conclusively be wrong think about it with equities you can never ever conclusively be wrong you tell me to buy a stock it's trading at 20. I buy it it goes down to 18 and 15 and 8 6 and 5 years later come back and sits down to six you told me to buy the stock you know what your response is not a long enough time Horizon company goes bankrupt system got in the way right that Liam and buy you put out in 2007 be looking really good today if only I think it's kind of fun not knowing what the right answer is but it makes us all uncomfortable when you finish valuing your stock you know the question you're going to ask is how do I know I got the right answer I'm going to save you the trouble you will not and you have to be okay with it some people that's psychological damage you can't do it be open about it the fact is this makes you uncomfortable but it's a reality but I'm going to add to that proposition because you're also told all the way through the Quant course is that getting some an answer that's more precise is better than getting an answer that's less precise right it sounds like it should be true but to illustrate why that can be dangerous I'm going to give you two stocks that went public in the same week in 2019. those both started with the word else and they both had four letters in the name one was a company called Lyft remember Lyft got to the market before Uber is first ride sharing company to go public small company lots of potential losing tons of money working on a business model the other was a company called Levi Strauss didn't Levi's drugs were public in 2019. it's been around 150 years it used to be a public company the last century was taken private is going back public again so here's my first question but Levi's Strauss we got left and this is a variant the question as to the start of the last class which of these two companies can you value more precisely an answer is Levi starts lots of History you know business model clearly there you know exactly how they make their money if you're if you've forgotten just look at the mirror and look at the back of your jeans and you got the answer the five basically still get 70 percent of its revenues and profits from those 501s and the variance thereof so if I judge your valuations based on Precision the Levi Strauss valuation is always going to be more precise in the lift valuation but here's the follow-up question which of these companies is there a bigger payoff to doing valuation think about what made Levi's trust easy for you to Value lots of History established business model you know exactly how they make them and everybody has exactly those advantages everybody's valuation of Levi Strauss is going to be as precise as yours where's the payoff in contrast think of a company like Lyft most people give up I include most VCS most investors they price the company they might do what everybody else is doing the very fact that you sat down and tried to build a business model gives you an advantage the payoff to doing valuation is greatest when you feel most uncertain the payoff to doing valuation is greater for young companies and over mature companies for emerging market companies over developed Market companies for companies in the middle of a market crisis as opposed to companies in the middle of a mark when markets are nice and stable it's precisely when you feel you cannot do valuation they actually should try to do valuation uncertainty is a feature not about it's a it's a fact of life you got to deal with we'll talk about tools you can do do use to deal with it more in a more healthy way which brings me my third misconception by valuation if I make my model bigger it's going to get better I'll give away how old I am by telling you what I used on my first valuation it's 1980 I think at the value of company sort of class you know the first thing I had to do was I had to write with my hand and a pen to the company asking for an annual report the party said are you crazy why don't you just go online and download it there was no one online and downloading I had to write to the company for an annual report if I'd lived in New York I might have been able to go to some library and pull up annual reports but it's hit and miss luckily this company mailed me back the annual report in about two weeks snailment those so get it back and I sit down to Value the company and here's what I had at a ledger sheet you ever seen a ledger sheet just a blank sheet of paper with lines already pre-drawn huge Plus for me because I got the lines crooked every single time I try to draw and a pencil I learned very early on no pens only pencils because you make a mistake with a pen you're gonna have a page full of junk and a calculator and a very early version of a calculator there's no there was no present value function the HP 12cs were just starting to come out I think the very first financial calculators and I had to take each cell and hand calculate when you do a valuation on a ledger sheet with a pencil and a calculator you know how many line items you will have in your evaluation as few as you can get away with because every cell has to be hand calculated today's sedanta value company Alexa you're going to write macros macros on top of micro macros it's so easy to add detail right let's stop at 10 we're not 15 why not 25. it's easy to build big complex models and it gives the illusion that you're getting more precise answers because you're more detailed if you don't believe me pick up a banking valuation it'll run to 15 worksheets in 500 line items to Value one company about two summers ago my youngest son was just who's a junior at Yale at that time was working at a hedge fund during the summer and he calls me in the middle of the summer said dad I have a question he never asked me questions I'm puzzled about what he did not know the answer to already says what's your question he said I've been asked to do evaluation my managing directors asked me to do a three-statement forecast for my company in a three statement forecasters it's one of those banking nonsense activities they make you go through I don't know whether they actually believe that this matters but you forecast every single line item of the income statement the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows in the next 25 years he says I don't know how to do it how should I do it and I said I would tell you if I knew he said but you've been teaching evaluation I said in 40 Years of evaluation I've never once ever forecast at all three financial statements he said but don't you need numbers from them I said I need six numbers why are we forecasting the other 494. this sounds like an exercise and distraction when you build these incredibly complex models two things happen one is what I call input fatigue have you ever found it I'll describe what it feels like and if any of you worked in in something like an investment Bank you know exactly what I'm talking about it usually hits you around 10 p.m on a Saturday night and you're still at work that tells you something about your work you're getting ready to shut down things because you're exhausted you think you're done and a managing director was a complete jerk comes to the annual report puts it on your desk and says I want this company valued first thing tomorrow morning hi Sunday morning this is trial by fire you want to see how much you really want this job now part of me wants to exercise the option to abandon it's a deeply satisfying option to exercise deeply dissatisfying things happen afterwards because it usually takes a form of picking up the annual report throwing in your managing director's facing you do it yourself that's a deeply satisfying moment as it leaves your hand and then bad things happen after that that we want to talk about you think about it for a moment but then you remember the the rent you're paying the car payments coming to you the bills that are building up you say okay so not a value company with your in-house valuation model remember there are there are elves in the basement who are working on these models would be bigger and bigger models it requires 85 inputs you value one company and you sit there and you start entering the numbers initially a very carefully think about each input you get to the 15 then put the clock strikes midnight you look down his stomach drops there are 70 more inputs to go you look at the 16th infant says what was the inventory five years ago years ago part of you want to look it up but that part's too exhausted to get out of the chair the other part of me prompts you make up the random number let's move on it's amazing how quickly the random numbers roll out and how difficult it is it is to tell where the output comes out what was random and what was not here's another little secret evaluation you're doing a valuation with a lot of random number inputs the best way to hide it is have a lot of detail in your output your 500 line items who has any idea what you put in it's easy to hide garbage in complex models because you mixed up the big stuff with the small stuff the stuff that should matter with stuff that's pure distraction the second thing that happens with models is I'm not sure who runs who are you running the model or is the model running gear there's a point where the power shifts but clearly you're at the mercy of the model the model says go get me a number you go get the number go get me a cup of coffee go get a cup of coffee I should remember a JP Morgan Equity at that time there was no chase in its name equity research report from the early 90s so but a company that I was pretty familiar with stock was trading at 35 and the Target price the analyst had put is 85. it's like all the ants I knew him and I said why do you like the company so much what is it about the company he said I didn't do it I said what do you mean you didn't do it your name's on the report it says 85 dollars who did it he said value Mac did it I said who the heck is value Mac because that's our in-house valuation model they said what did you do sneak into your office in the middle of the night value the company and leave it on your desk but you see what he was trying to say right it's a complex model I entered numbers on one side 85 dollars popped on the other side don't blame me the model value the company at 85 dollars what are the messages I hope to deliver in this class is less is more don't create detail unless you feel you can bring something into that detail I'll give you an example in 40 Years of evaluation I've never once in my life broken down working capital into its constituent parts this change in working capitalism but if you break working corporate aren't as inventory and receivables and payables and you're saying what I'm incapable I'll confess I'm incapable of forecasting days receivable for the next 30 years if you are able to do it I am in awe but if you cannot do that what's the point of breaking it down one of the pushbacks I got in the Tesla valuation is why aren't you breaking their revenues down into the 10 different business businesses area okay first they're not in 10 businesses but you could argue there is the automobile business there is the energy business because then with solar system and you could potentially talk about you know automated driving as a business and perhaps batteries as a business you know why I'm not breaking it down because I don't know what that breakdown looked like Tesla doesn't know what the breakdown looked like right now they could tell you the story and if you can't do it what's the point of breaking it down and making it look like you're bringing something special to the valuation when you're not when in doubt aggregate you know what I mean by that in five so if you're taking a company where your five businesses and you have no idea how they're going to evolve but you think that they will all add to Value do the Consolidated number it's a lot of log numbers you're better off forecasting an aggregated number than individual line items so I'm going to push for Simplicity not for the sake of Simplicity because it can be pushed towards it to limits but building only as much detail as you need so that long leader let me set up the Bermuda Triangle we've talked about bias we've talked about complexity we've talked about uncertainty those are the three biggest reasons why valuations fail it's not cost to Capital being computed wrong it's because we can't handle those three or we're not honest about it I call it the Bermuda Triangle evaluation because as you probably know the Bermuda Triangle is this mythical area in the Atlantic with ships and planes supposedly disappeared the Bermuda Triangle evaluation is where Good Sense disappears sometimes as people get caught up in the details it's good to step back and say what are we really talking about here are we talking about some ways to push the number up is that what we're adding the premium so let's be honest about it we have a job we want a higher number but these are the forces that kind of impinge on valuation teaching people the mechanics of evaluation is easy but teaching people how to deal with these three forces is more difficult because you're trying to overcome human nature which is you're pushing against doing the healthy thing so that long lead and let me talk about the three ways you can put a number on an asset there are only three the first is to do an intrinsic valuation sounds fancy but an intrinsic valuation you value an asset or a business based on its cash flows based upon it as a business a discounted cash flow evaluation might be the most typical way in intrinsic valuation plays out but that's what an intrinsic valuation is the second way to put a number on something is look what other people are paying for similar things if that sounds mildly familiar whenever you use a multiple price earnings Evita beta and compromise 15 companies you're not valuing companies you're pricing them nothing wrong with it but it's a different way you're judging how much to pay based what other people are paying and there's a third way you could put a number on an asset and this is perhaps the only part evaluation where you get something new and different coming to play when you've been asked it was cash flow is a contingent on something happening an example would be you know an oil company with reserves which are expensive to develop but if oil prices stop those results be worth more a young pharmaceutical company with a drug working its way through the pipeline if it gets approved it could be a multi-billion dollar drug when you have cash flows that are contingent on something happening you have an option and there are advantages then to bring an optional pricing model it's not as if we're valuing options for the sake of option is saying this is an option there's a premium attachment so with that broad leading let's talk about the basis for all of these approaches if you're looking at a publicly traded company you pick a publicly traded company to value if you believe markets are efficient the game is already old you see what what's the best estimate of value for a publicly traded company in an efficient market right now if I ask you what's the best estimated value for Tesla and you believe markets are efficient 171 dollars per share games off now we can play games and we can build models but the reality is if you believed in efficient markets this is an exercise in Futurity the markets may be efficient regard I mean in fact there's probably more evidence and markets are efficient than they're not efficient but when you sit down to do a valuation you're already making an assumption that markets make mistakes and markets are inefficient one of the things I'm going to talk about is what kinds of mistakes do you think markets make and remember to make money on the mistake what else what's the second half of this not only do they have to make mistakes they have to correct their mistakes how does the correction happen that becomes at the basis of every investment philosophy right you are assuming markets make mistakes and you're making assumptions about how they correct the mistakes but the kinds of mistakes and the corrections you're assuming are different depending on whether your intrinsic valuation or pricing or option pricing so let's start with discounted cash flow evaluation this kind of cash flow valuation is the most common version of intrinsic valuation but remember intrinsic valuation predates discounted cash flow validation in discounted cash flow valuation here's what you said the value of an asset is the present value the expected cash flows in the asset so DCFS are not a theory or a hypothesis they say you're getting a collection of cash flows what you should be willing to pay for those cash flows is the present value of those cash flows philosophically you are starting with a premise that every asset that generates cash flows has an intrinsic value you think why would that be even debatable and lots of people who believe there's no such thing as intrinsic value in fact I'll argue that many Traders look at the whole notion of intrinsic value as a waste of time but in intrinsic valuation you start with the premise that there is an intrinsic value and you're going to try to find it it's a little bit like the search for the Holy Grail though you know people have been searching for the Holy Grail in the beginnings of you know of Christianity two thousand years have been said how often are they found it I think Indiana Jones came a little close but I think you know but people keep trying intrinsic valuation is very much like that you keep searching even though you know you never find it you keep the faith and if you break down a discounted cash flow valuation model down into its ingredients here's what you're going to see you're going to see a life for the asset your value five years 10 years 20 years 50 years 100 years you're going to see cash flows over that life and you're going to see a discount rate that reflects a risk of those cash flows let's not make this more complicated than it has to be we might have lots of assumptions we use to get there but that's what drives a discounted cash flow model what you might need to assume to make money on your discounted cash flow valuations first you have to assume that markets make mistakes reasonable assumption I don't think you'll find a single person pushed back on you on that assumption even the firmest believer in efficient markets will concede that markets make mistakes I was RA for Gene farmer won the Nobel Prize for the the official Market hypothesis in 1981 when he was UCLA in 82. and he would say look markets make mistakes so that assumption is easy one second you could assume that you can find those mistakes with your metrics and models now we're in dangerous crime why what's the track record of people who claim to find market mistakes let me reframe the question remind me again how much the average active portfolio manager beats the market by each year kind of a trick question you know the answers they don't in fact they make one and a half percent on average less than the market strangest profession you're going to ask me how they stay in business with the analogous the analogy of it off it's like starting a plumbing business called floodsrus would you ever pay me but we do this all the time with active right because Hope Springs return but let's say you're special you found a market mistake let's get the market mistake a name let's say you value Facebook and you get past the noise and you come up with a value of 200 per share the stock is trading at 120 something you go by a million shares of Facebook have you made any money yet what's the third assumption you need to make money the market has to correct its mistake and how do you get the market to correct its mistakes you can go on Reddit board and say Facebook is undervalued Facebook is undervalued but nobody's reading you anyway we'll talk about some people who might have the power to start change rolling but this is for most of us out of our hands you buy then you hope and then you pray and you hope again and you pray again and maybe it'll happen maybe it would but let's talk about the advantages and disadvantages of intrinsic slash discounted cash flow valuation I know many people claim to be Warren Buffett followers right one of the things Warren Buffett has said is he doesn't buy shares in a company buys a piece of a business if you truly believe that intrinsic valuation is what you should be doing right you're valuing your company as a business you're estimating cash flows the best you can so if you truly believe that you're not buying a thousand shares of a company but a piece of a business intrinsic valuation allows you to put a number in the business so that means you have to understand the business the competition the market all the things that intrinsic valuation requires and if you are willing to accept the cash flows on your investment it doesn't really matter whether the rest of the world agrees with you or not right you collect you invest in a company you collect the cash flows and in theory that should make you happy the reason that's a little difficult is most investors have a Time arise even if they have a long time arise in the end of which the client says what have you done for me lately and the way we level up is we look at the actual market price but at least in theory if you're willing to disconnect the investment from from the price and you say look I get the cash flows I'm okay with this that's at the heart of why some people find it appealing what are the disadvantages the first is if you think about the inputs needed for discounted cash flow evaluation and the work you got to put into value company it's a lot more work you got to understand the business come up with cash flows at least on paper I think people overestimate how much work is involved but there is work involved and that puts off a few people second when you come up with those numbers which you call growth rates and cash flows in this country we talked about bias the bias can show up there it's not like intrinsic valuations don't have bias but here's something that I think can really get in the way of people using intrinsic valuation let's say you do an intrinsic valuation of every company in a sector is it possible for every company in the sector to be overvalued on an entrance evaluation basis sure right because each company you look at the price you look at the cash flows yeah you can have every company you think so what if you believe in entrance evaluation you shouldn't be buying any of those companies right and let's say you look across the market and everything you look at looks overvalued overvalued overvalued you really shouldn't even be buying equities do you think who cares if you're the if you're hired by Fidelity run an equity mutual fund what does your mission statement required to do to collect money from clients and invested in equities if you say look I can't find anything to buy you're going to get fired and somebody else is going to run the and it's not fair to your clients because they wanted to invest networks your job requires you to be investing Equity sometimes an intrinsic valuation can you imagine being an intrinsic value Tech mutual fund manager for the last decade where do you go to find Value so when you look at intrinsic valuation you can see why for some groups of people it doesn't make sense if you don't sell that equity research unless your job is not to Value companies to price them because if you say sell sell sell in every company look at you're not going to be an equity research analyst law so this is not about good or bad it's about what's your job description your job description as an equity research analyst or as a portfolio management require you to do pricing so let's talk about the ingredients that have to come together for intrinsic valuation to work for you now first the assets you're looking at have to have cash flows you can't be an intrinsic value investor if you're investing in you know paintings or collectibles so your assets that you need to have cash flows and you guys you have to try to estimate what those cash flows are so it's better design for cash flow generating assets and if you dig a Little Deeper and you look at what you need to bring to the table for intrinsic valuation to work for you it is nice if you can have a long time Horizon you see how that helps you because remember you buy something because the price is different from the value and then you hope and pray that the price will adjust value assuming you're right in the first place in value there's a greater chance of that correction happening if you have a five-year time arise and then if you have a six month time right and it'd be really nice if you could provide the catalyst that starts the correction happening sounds mysterious right what does Carl I can or Blackman do the minute after they've taken a position in a company that they believe is on Direct what's the first thing they do stay silent go under rain no after they've acquired a position they're on CNBC they're in every Forum they can what are they yelling as loud as they can this company is worth more if it does this or it's broken up why because they want the correction process to begin they act as their own carriers activist investors have an advantage over the rest of us because they could be their own characters get ready to give up hope there's no chance I can do that you're right you don't have a hundred million dollars and maybe a platform on CNBC to broadcast it's right remember it's not just CNBC it's the fact that they've invested a hundred million 500 million that gives them but don't give up hope you could perhaps find some Catalyst that might cause the price to adjust well what are those catalysts when you have a company that's massively undervalued you want the market to take another look at the topic right especially if it's a company that's under the radar you think what might make the market maybe a surprise announcement right about maybe a CEO passing on new management is coming into play you're looking for change something that will draw attention to the company so when you look at companies and say should I be doing intrinsic valuation look at not just what you're valuing but also who you are as a person there's one final Factor the nature of this kind of cash flow evaluation of intrinsic valuation is you're often going against the crowd you're buying Facebook when everybody else is throwing up the hats you're selling Tesla when you know everybody else is buying you think so what I'm going to ask you when you were a kid and there was recess did what you do get affected by where everybody I'm not asking this in a good way it's who you are as a person some people are natural group followers and some people are natural contrarians if you were the kind of kid in school your teachers hate it because you're a contrarian you might be a good candidate for intrinsic valuation because you're going to be able to handle the fact that nobody else agrees with it that you're doing things that everybody else thinks is stupid don't underestimate the psychological aspects of what makes intrinsic valuation work for you so let's move on to pricing what is it basically you're attaching a number to something based on what other people are paying for similar things right so you've given up on the notion of intrinsic value saying I don't care what intrinsic value is you look to see what other people are doing and if you look at the ingredients you need for pricing first you need to find either something that looks exactly like your company which is going to be very difficult to do or a group of companies that you think are like yours in Wall Street parlance often this has become sector focused the software company other software companies I think it's a little unhealthy but you can see why you're looking for other companies like yours and you try to compare the pricing across these companies you're very quickly going to run into problem price per share across companies is not comparable why because it depends on the number of units you have so if your books your Hathaway you could be at 300 000 doesn't make you expensive you can have a penny stock with five cents doesn't make you cheap so you scale the price to something sounds fancy but you divide the price percent price per earnings price per book EV buy it basically it's a standardized price so you've got a group of companies if you claim are like yours you've standardized the price then you compare across companies and if you're careful you're going to notice that your company might be different from the residents higher growth the lower risk you adjust for those differences that in a nutshell is how pricing is done you pick a multiple you pick comparables you tell a story and are you assuming that markets make mistakes you are but in a different way you're assuming markets are right on average you know you know why I do that right because if you're if you're comparing across software companies you're implicitly assuming the Market's right on average across software companies but it's getting individual companies from you found the cheap software stock and the correction is more likely here because it's more visible right so if you're a stock trading at eight times earnings in a sector where everybody else trades at 20 you're going to stick out like a sore thumb Corrections and pricing occur much more quickly than Corrections and intrinsic valuation because it doesn't require business models and cash flows and intrinsic value stories it's based on hey it's eight times only because it's lower than 20 times earnings so if you think about the advantages of pricing they're almost the flip side of the disadvantage of this yeah okay so you're always in sync with the market so remember I said you know with intrinsic valuation you could find everything to be overvalued you could never find everything overpriced just like we can't all be above average right average basically brings down what you need to compare to with pricing there will always be something that is cheap so if your job is to buy equities no matter what you're going to find pricing to be better suited for you than valuation because you're always going to find something that looks cheaper out of the sector and how do most mutual fund managers get judged if you go to Morningstar they do rankings take a judge against each other right you're putting a segment and you do better than the segment even if you've lost 16 of everybody else lost 25 you look like a hero you're judged on a pricing basis not in an absolute basis the world is a pricing word intrinsic value is actually the alien way of thinking about this word because the rest of the world is based on pricing judgments 95 of what passes for valuation out there is pricing and you can see already what so if you're tempted to join the pricing crowd let me give you the other side of why pricing can get you into trouble you find something to be cheap on a pricing basis trading at only 500 times earnings everything else trades at a thousand times earnings you buy the promise of the entire sector is overpriced you're going to get a correction your only consolation price might be that you lost only eighty percent of your money whereas everybody else lost 95 percent pricing doesn't mean so when people talk about something being cheap on a pricing basis they're not saying it's cheap it's a conditional cheap it's cheap given these other things I'm comparing it to it's like saying I have cholesterol at 300 it's not too bad relative people who've died of heart attacks in the last week I look really good yeah you're technically right that's pricing you're making judgments based more to comparing it here and finally if you think about the disadvantage of pricing I thought it's you know you require lots of inputs for DCF you can do it much more quickly with pricing that's true but implicitly when you use pricing you are making assumptions about cash flows growth at risk the only difference is you don't make them explicit I mean if you pay a hundred times earnings for for a company are you assuming that the company will have high growth in the future absolutely by paying 100 times earnings you're implicit if I ask you how high the group you haven't thought that through right you see how dangerous this is basically you're paying pricing based on a story of this company is high growth by keeping it implicit you don't even see how huge your assumption has to be to justify what you're paying I remember when Tesla was at 1.2 trillion I reverse engineered what revenues they would need to justify one point to it and I came up with like one and a half trillion you know how many companies have generated revenues or one and a half trillion in history none none have even generated but trillion in revenues and I asked somebody how are they going to get a trillion in a habitaties he said what are you talking about I said by paying 1.2 trillion that's what you're assuming you might as well be aware of what you're assuming we can talk about whether that's reasonable or not but as long as you don't even make it explicit how do you know so let's talk about when pricing works best for you first for pricing to work you need lots of similar things being priced out there do you see why pricing is so much more difficult with a Picasso than it is with us with a software company you're on the price of Picasso what do you need 100 other picassos they've got traded in the last day good luck with that because if you're lucky you might find one buy transaction with a Picasso two years ago you got to adjust for time you got to adjust for changes in the market which is one reason the Praises of Fine Art get to keep eight percent or ten Christies will charge you an arm and a leg to get something pressed pricing is much easier when you have lots of similar assets out there and if you look inward at what you need to bring to the table for pricing to work for you first you can work with much shorter time Horizons why because pricing mistakes get corrected soon so if you have a six month time Horizon you can see why pricing works better and if you're judged against other people who are all surprising you can see how it even works what's even better you don't even have to make money you just have to find something that's cheap in the market but I'll give you one thing that can actually augment the benefits of price when you price something it can be underpriced or overpriced right you know Enterprise you buy it your overpriced you sell it most mutual funds in the US are long only funds which means they can only buy things so you're restricting yourself only to underpriced stocks and hoping they go up at its core if a hedge fund is really a hedge fund what can a hedge fund do that a traditional mutual fund cannot it can sell short that's what makes it a hedge fund that's a defining characteristic for hedge fund is you can go long and short you see how in pricing that can help you because if you're a good hedge fund and you buy something that's underpriced and sell short something that's overpriced you don't have ever be right about the level of the market right all you need to do is Corrections towards on the pricing and you can make money even as the market is down 20 percent Citadel made 16 billion dollars last year whether they got lucky I don't know but no you can see why hedge funds and maybe these are made eight billion so if you can play both sides of the pricing game you augmented the benefits of pricing take a pause though and accept that there are some things that you can both value and price but some things that you can only press let's start with us companies businesses bonds stocks you can value them and you can price what about Commodities if I ask you what's you know oil going to trade at but you can do pricing right by looking at what is past price cycle so in fact Commodities are the longest time Traders based not trading on what's a cycle look like is it going to go back it's pricing you can try to Value oil but to do that you'd have to have demand for oil and supply of oil some macro economies do it they're terrible at it but you could value it very difficult to do a currency US dollar you can't value the dollar you can price exchange rate we get a good currency your pricing should increase over time you're a bad currency your pricing should decrease over time say what's a good currency a good currency what makes the currency a good currency what are the characteristics you want for a good currency I'm sorry for things right first let's accept it the reason we carry dollars in our pockets is not because we expect them to double in value while they're sitting in a pocket but because we want to pay for lunch I think that's so boring we've got to eat you gotta pay for things so it's a medium of exchange and if you forget it and leave it in your pocket for a year you hope you can buy if not the same things close to the same things it has to hold just hold its value the Swiss franc incredibly good currency not only is it medium medium of stage in Switzerland but if you leave Switzerland you can go into any Bank anywhere in the world and they were convert it using the current exchange rate the local currency I actually left 100 Swiss Francs in my pocket in 2016 on a trip to Switzerland founded three years later and actually bought more than they did in 2016. it's nice to have a currency with deflation this is the good thing about Fiat currencies really would you want a thousand Venezuelan Bolivar in your pocket you put a thousand Venezuelan first is it a good medium of exchange I don't even know well in Venezuela whether you could pay for things with Bolivar you Alpha Boulevard they probably said you have lettuce instead it holds its value a little better and if you put a thousand Boulevard in your pocket and you forget about it for a year you might as well burn it High inflation it becomes worthless the vet is one Boulevard is a terrible currency what about the Indian rupee when I left India actually long time ago I remember you could use the Indian rupee in Mumbai airport until you went through immigration into the gates which are the international flights and this was supremely insulting it was still an Indian soil all the stores would accept early dollars a little p is a medium of Exchange in India unless of course you had a 500 rupee note five years ago with the demonetization you played a little game which was really dangerous and it has high so you can see that within currencies you can have good or bad currencies I'll leave you thinking about where you'd put Bitcoin in that Spectrum because that's really going to determine whether you should pay 23 000 for Bitcoin right this is not a you can't use this little game up there you know it's scarcity that drives it it's a crypto is the future stop bullshitting and start making a use case for Bitcoin if it's a currency why aren't more people using it in transactions because it's an incredibly inefficient currency so currencies can only be priced they cannot be valid and finally you have collectibles the longest standing collectible is gold you've never been able to value gold but you can price it what drives the pricing of gold it depends on how much Faith or absence of Faith you have in paper currencies that's why gold prices historically have gone up but inflation is high or when there are crisis you abandon paper currencies because they're dependent on governments and Banks because I don't trust those guys that's why I called Bitcoin Millennial gold there's a lot of 30 year old said I don't want to hold gold but I don't trust anyone well good luck with Bitcoin gold has a much longer history of holding its value my point is when you're asked to Value something before you get too excited make sure it's something that can be bad to be valued needs cash flows if it doesn't have cash flows you can price it and you can try to do a job pricing it but being aware what can be valued in price is one of the first kills to bring to the state now just as a as a detour I'm often and I tell people there are only three ways to add a company you can do an intrinsic valuation you can price it or you can do an option pricing somebody says what about you know what what about some of the parts valuation what about liquidation valuation generically these are what I fit into this grouping called asset based valuation we're instead of adding a company you value the pieces that make up the company but here's why I don't think it's a different way of adding a company to get the values of each of those pieces I either have to use intrinsic valuation or pricing right so if you have five real estate properties and I want to Value each one I put a number in each one I can either price the properties or value the properties it is just a subset of one of the other approaches and we come back and talk about when you might have to do asset-base valuation it might be because you're doing a liquidation valuation or some of the parts valuation an accounting increasingly in Fair Value accounting your job is to assess a number for individual assets foreign don't tell me what this is right now I want you to think about based on what your what you know right now on the different approach especially with intrinsic valuation and pricing which one you think because I already told you personal characteristics which one you think you would like to pick and then 15 weeks from now after the you've gone through an entrance evaluation and pricing of your company I'm going to ask you the same question because some of you will change your minds you might decide after you've actually done an intrinsic valuation that entrance evaluation is not what you want to do and that's okay but for the moment at least for yourself make the Judgment what do I think will best suit me but don't get too caught up with it because you might have to revisit the choice so intrinsic valuation pricing let's go to the third and final where you can put a number on an S now you know what makes an option an option it's a security that cannot live on its own options are derivative securities or I prefer to call them leeches you need something to Leach on to there is an underlying asset and usually there's a contingency that's basically what drives an option is there an underlying asset because without the underlying asset there is no option but I'll give you the easiest way to detect when you're dealing with an option so the payout diagram you've at least seen these pair of diagrams right even if you haven't don't remember a single thing about option pricing this is what makes your options unique is the kind of payoff diagram you have this is a payout diagram for a call payoff diagram for put what do they share in common you have limited losses the most you can lose when you buy a call or a put option is what you paid for it up front that's going to become significant when you think about what's the big deal if there's an option limited losses potentially unlimited profits file that away because when you we know we we will spend some time on option pricing models but you know if you think about direct examples of options of course there are lots of directors you can value warrants you can value call options we're not going to do any of that in this class that's a there's an options class and a Futures class for it if you're interested in those the options we're going to value in this class are going to be options that you run into the context evaluation I've listed a couple already but if you have natural resource companies with reserves which are non-viable today you have an option why they're not viable today but they could be viable a year from now if you have a young company with a patent that it's working on but the patent hasn't become a commercial product you have an option because if that patent becomes a commercial product there's a contingency and there's one example we're going to delve into which is when you buy shares in a deeply troubled company let me be specific about what makes this company deeply troubled it's a big money losing company the history of losing money it's not just one year there's lots of debt but hanging over the head of this company we are losing money and you have a lot of debt what are you worried about bankruptcy I'm going to argue that nearby shares in this company you're buying an option 90 of the Airline stocks in the world you're not buying for dividends I hope offer cash flows unless you like large negative cash flows you're buying them for the same reasons you buy options if things turn around you hope that there's a payoff it's not something we're going to apply in every company maybe five or ten percent of companies this is going to come into play and I will use option pricing models even though you're going to be stretching the limits of these margins when you value these These are called real options you're stretching the limits of these models because option pricing models were designed for three month listed options we take those models to Value 10-year real options which are not traded and I'll concede when I put an option pricing value on some of these that there's a lot of noise but you know why I'm going to persist because as insights you're going to get about what drives the value of these assets that comes from using an option pricing framework and I'll give you the most significant one when you do discounted cash flow evaluation and increase the risk of the ask what should happen to value higher risk higher discount rate lower value right when you're doing pricing you're comparing across stocks and you increase risk on a stock you're going to lower the pricing lower PE ratio but when you're looking at an asset as an option and the increaser is something magical happens the value actually goes up the values of options increase with risk it sounds mysterious but there's a very simple reason why when you think about risk which is that keeps you awake at night upside risk or downside risk when was the last time you lay awake and then oh my God my stock is up 80 this is so troubling it's The Outsiders that you worry about right and what did I do with the option payoff diagrams for you with the downside risk I limited it I said you can't lose more than you paid risk becomes your Ally and that's a huge Insight because if you decide to buy equity in a deep in Airlines please don't buy equity in a deeply troubled stable Airline I don't even know what that means but they lost 100 million last year they can guarantee you they can lose 100 million every year for the rest of Eternity this is not the kind of investment you want to make you want to invest in these stocks because you hope for that jump risk becomes your ally that's why we're going to do real options it's not because we're going to Hope and attach black trolls models and put a number on these options because there's a point in an assets development where you got to stop thinking about it as a traditional value Asset and think about more in terms of so option pricing is going to give us those insights in terms of actual pricing you're going to be stretching the limits of water so you're going to be doing things that are essentially you know an option pricing purist it's going to Blanchard really put up an option pricing model in there we're going to be you know the underlying asset might not be traded the variance might not be observable it's messy so be very clear in mind where option pricing fits into your agenda because it's not about putting a number per se but getting a different perspective on what drives value so let me sum up you know they've been told there are hundreds of different ways you can put a number in an asset that's true but they can fit into one of these three buckets next time you see a valuation or I'm going to put valuation in quotes first make sure it's not it's evaluation and not a pricing because people say I value the company using a p ratio no no let's stop right there you can't value companies PE ratios you can price them and if it's a valuation dig deeper you know is it an intrinsic valuation where they're doing the right thing yeah so this class we're going to structure it first with intrinsic valuation then we're going to pricing and real options and essentially by the end of the class you will have everything in your toolbox and it's good to have everything in your toolbox don't become too focused and I do only intrinsic valuation I don't believe in pricing you're still at the mercy of markets you can believe in it or not believe in it but remember who delivers the rewards and punishments eventually is the market you have to understand pricing even if you don't do pricing so when we start on Monday we're going to start on packet one and we're going to start by looking at structure of discounted cash flow models and perhaps some of the inputs that dry value but I will see you on Monday yeah 
okay um I don't know what you're asking questions thank you yeah okay folks before I start there are a couple of questions I'm going to ask both my corporate finance class and this one just to nag people how many of you are not part of a group yet you got the makings of a group right here so that's one quick solution right look around see the arms old-fashioned way or you know but if you're in the orphan list and you've not been adopted then you might want to reach out to people on that list and see what their interests are you know don't wait for a group to adopt you because you might have enough of a critical match to create your own group second question and I just like an honest answer because right now I'm not expecting the you know the the answer I hope to hear soon how many of you have not picked a company to Value yet okay that's you know in fact I I'm surprised as many of you did not put up your hands so you're either lying or you're very good at picking a company but um I hope that next week when I ask this question which I will at the start of you know next Monday next Wednesday but next Wednesday each of you would have picked a company don't play Hamlet here don't sit there as I can't make up my mind should I do this should I do that just pick a damn company move on change your mind if you need to and if you can go in and enter your company's name in the master list you're not logged in you can change your mind this is just for my you know well-being and so I can go to sleep knowing you guys are working on something so go in and enter a company in that Master list and um as you go through you can start filling in the numbers okay so let's uh talk about So today we're going to start on the groundwork evaluation and um a few years ago I wrote a post saying if you have just because you have a d and a CF doesn't mean you have a DCF the reason I do that is people use this DCF as a culture because I did a DCF and you're supposed to back off saying oh you did a DCF that's great you must know what you're doing and today I'm going to argue that there are lots of variants of DCFS that don't pass the smell test in fact if I could create a museum of bad DCFS I would and a lot of banking DCFS would end up there because of mismatching and inconsistency So today we're going to talk about being consistent what I mean by that is you tell me how you estimate the cash flows and I'll tell you what discount rate goes with the cash flows someone lay the groundwork when you look at a business you have a choice you can either value just the equity in the business or value the entire business it's amazing how people confuse the two and the simplest way to separate the two is think about buying a house somewhere in the New York area unless you're a drug dealer you have to borrow the money to buy the house right so you take a 1.6 million dollar loan you buy the house let's say it's worth 2 million if I ask you the minute after you bought the house how much the house is worth your answer is I paid 2 million I think that's what it's worth if I ask you how much your equity in that house is you're gonna set the 400 000 right to six months later housing prices are down four hundred thousand I come in and ask you how much is your house worth you can say well Redfin says I'm worth it's worth 1.6 million if I ask you how much is your Equity worth it's not worth nothing right you can have valuable businesses where Equity is worth nothing why because you borrowed so much money that the business value is less than the outstanding debt so you have a choice when you sit down to Value business you can either value the equity or value the business and this is something I drum all the way through my corporate finance class so if you've heard it before you're going to hear it again if you are valuing the equity in a business you got to wear blinders I'm going to ask you what are your cash flows the cash flow you're gonna you're gonna estimate our cash flows to equity investors what's left over after interest payments after principal payments after debt cash flows and the discount rate you apply on those cash flows will be the rate of return You demand as an equity investor let's generically call it cost of equity but it's what you would demand given the riskiness of the equity investment cash flows to equity discounted the cost of equity is a value of equity You could argue that that is in fact evaluation is to focus on your shares in equity investor but there's another way you can approach valuation instead of trying to Value just the equity in a business think about the business itself so remember the house analogy I'm not asking you what the value of your Equity is I'm asking what's the value of the house remember there are two people who supplied capital for this business right Equity investors who provide Equity capital and lenders who provide debt could be bondholders could be best when you're trying to Value the business you look at the collective cash flow that both players get out of the business it's kind of counter-intuitive but I'm saying if you're an equity investor you get cash flows to equity could be dividends could be cash flows left over but if your lenders you get cash flows as well right interest payment principal payments the reason it's counterintuitive that your owner of a business you borrow money you don't think of the banker as a partner you often think of him or her as an adversary but the reality is you're both supplying Capital the collective cash flow you both get out of the business is called the cash flow to the firm debt cash flows are no longer cash flows leaving the firm they go to another claim order in the phone so that's a cash flow you're now looking at is that Collective cash flow and if that's the cash flow you're discounting your discount rate can no longer be what you want as an equity investor it's got to be a weighted average of what you want which is the cost of equity and what the lenders want which is the cost of debt and if that sounds even remotely familiar what's it weighted average called don't say whack it's so crude it's cost to Capital right so it's it's a weighted average what your Equity investors and lenders want it's a cost of capital cash flows The Firm discounted the cost of capital gives you the value of the entire business do you think but I'm interested in buying shares in the company you're right you're interested in the equity so to get from the value of the business to the equity value what do I need to do I need to subtract now just like I did with the house what I or Outsiders I'm going to subtract out the debt and we'll talk about what you need to and and you don't need to subtract out but you can back into Equity back so there are two ways you can get to equity value one is directly by taking cash flows equity and discounting them at the cost of equity the other is indirectly by valuing the business and subtracting our debt first principle in valuation is don't mix and match that's going to be the overriding message today but here's a second message sometimes when you look at evaluation and you look at who did it you allow yourself to be intimidated right Goldman Sachs they must know what they're doing KKR they must know what they're doing so today I want to dispel that mythology that just because somebody's been doing valuation and has a name attached to them that they're going to follow the first principle's evaluation so I'm going to go back in time and foreign that was done this is a real acquisition that was done in the late 70s I almost never do case studies I've never done a Harvard case study but sometimes I take Pages out of Harvard case studies just for the last value because let's face it when something ends up in a Harvard case it's always strategic the numbers aren't after thought you're supposed to have big fuzzy stories and as long as a big fuzzy story sound good you pass the case this is from a company called Kennecott and I lay out the backstory cannacart was a copper Mining Company in the 1970s and it had a coal mining subsidiary called Peabody Coal and in the late 70s the Anti-Trust rules the Enterprise authorities Force kind of got to divest themselves of the Peabody called subsidiary so they sold the subsidiary they got 600 million dollars in cash in return can Accord is about a three billion dollar company so the minute after they sold Peabody they had a 600 million dollar cash balance and it terrified the management say what were they afraid of they were afraid that somebody would acquire them and use their own cash to kind of make the acquisition go through so I have two questions your company you got 600 million dollars in cash that you don't have a need for what's the most sensible way that a publicly traded company can get rid of 600 million that they don't have a use for give it back right that thought never even crossed Kenneth Kenneth what would shareholders do with the money stupid things like a bill or buy a car you can't allow that to happen so let me ask you a second question you have 600 million in cash what's the stupidest way to get rid of cash quickly go to an investment bank and say I have a lot of cash can you help me spend it right I mean this is if you think about it it's silly it's like walking into a Bloomingdale's Pace sales people on commission let's say Bloomingdale's does you walk in with five thousand dollars in cash and you wave it and say I have to spend this by this evening you're going to have a lot of people surrounding you for the rest of the day right but in this case can a card decided that that's what they were going to do they went to First Boston at that time one of the leading M A banks on Wall Street and they said look we have 600 million in cash can you help us spend it and first person said not a problem we'll find you a perfect Target company and they did they came back with this company called Carver Ender company mimics abrasives that coincidentally was available to buy for roughly 600 million dollars here's one of the simple rules you have a lot of cash on your balance sheet the value of a Target company will magically expand to take all the cash out of your balance sheet but they said we've done our due diligence two most dangerous words in business I don't even know what that means either but your Visions are bad you know Bankers with I should I mean basically you think about 15 people working over the numbers but in this case they said we've backed it up with a valuation and you're going to get a bargain and these were the cash flows that first Boston used to justify the carburetor acquisition I'm going to describe what they did in terms of estimating cash flows and I wanted to think about one very specific question given how the estimated cash flows what is the right discount rate to use so here's what they did start with Revenue subtracted operating Inc expenses came up with operating income subtracted interest expenses to come up with net income than added appreciation subtract capex they went through all the motions and then subtract our debt payments to come up with their final cash flows see ready so those are the cash flows you have to come up with a discount right I'm going to give you six different discount rates you could use only one of them is right and I want you to tell me which of these six discount rates I should use to Discount those cash flows that I just described here so you've got Kennecott the acquiring company that's going to come up with the money and I'm the cost of equity and that cost a capital you have carburetum the target Company the company you're acquiring at their cost of equity and their cost of capital after the acquisition there will be a merge company and have a cost of equity and a cost of capital so let's start with the easy question given how the estimated cash flows should I be using a cost of equity or a cost of capital and why anybody want to try I described the way they got cash flow so I embedded there is the answer so Equity Bill why and what is it about what they did that leads you to the cost of equity they subtracted the minute you start with net income you're already kind of digging a hole for yourself as to where you're going the fact is these are cash flows after debt payments a cash flows equity so it should be a cost effective equity now comes the question that half of all M A Bankers still get wrong whose discount rate whose cost of equity should I use the acquiring company's cost of equity and play Devil's Advocate they're coming up with the money and we have this notion of cost of equities what it costs you to raise money so that's their cost of equity it's a Target company's cost of equity or maybe some weighted average of the day what do you think Target company does everybody agree with that and what's the reason because be ready because if you've got an m a group you're going to be pushed back on that because you're going to say about it it's acquiring company what is the rationale for why it should be the target company's cost of equity but it's still my money right I'm coming up with the money so if I think about cost of equity is what it costs me to raise money as an acquiring company I'm the one raising the money why should I give them the cost of equity or Target company important but I think we're going in circles so why is using the target company's cost of equity giving me a better measure of what it's worth I can get a present value using my cost of equity as well why is that present value I you're right but I want you to I mean I wanted to come up with the answer because this is something that you will have to fight the fight on not just on this issue but lots of this kind of casual evaluations I'll help you out when you do Capital budgeting and you have a project how do we come up with a discount rate for a project based on the risk of the project the discount rate you should not reflect the risk of the entity raising the money it should reflect the risk of what you're investing in otherwise every risky business is going to look cheap to you as a Safe Company right I'm going to go around buying and people do this all the time a t almost destroyed itself in the 1990s because it thought it could take a phone company cost to Capital and go around buying all these technology I mean look that looks cheap that looks cheap no it doesn't look cheap you just use the wrong discount rate half of all M A valuations are flawed right after if you're in the Delaware courts and you take these fairness opinions at the minimum pass it through the consistency test because if you've mismatched the discount rate to the cash flows the rest is almost academic right who cares what your growth rate is you committed a cardinal sip confession is not going to do this for you right this is not one of the I you know I coveted my neighbor's Tesla kind of thing it's like I burnt the neighbor's house down with the neighbor in it and said can you give me it's not something you can just pass by so the right is and don't do a weighted average it doesn't make any sense it's like you know you have a 300 pounder who marries a 75 pounder you don't become a average if you know on average your weights are okay right but one of you is massively underweight the other is massively overweight taking an average doesn't make the problem go away doesn't matter I didn't use the ration I'd use the lowest there that's a completely dangerous path to grow right because then if you're a risky business you will never buy a safe investment what if I came to you with a guaranteed investment as Microsoft but I said you have a government contract you're going to make 150 million every year for the next 20 years I should be using a look this has nothing to do with being conservative don't assume that just because you're being conserved your DCF is somehow of higher quality yeah the the entire focus on DCF is to come up with an expected value so in this case the discount rate this should have used is 16 and a half percent you know at first Boston used what's the worst choice you could make here wrong company wrong discount rate they use the 10.5 percent can a cards cost the capital you're saying what's the big deal you take their cash flows you don't change a single assumption you take that cash flows use the right discount rate you knock the present value down by 200 million this company goes from being undervalued which is the basis for their fairness opinion to being overvalued they just got M A fees for asking a company to pay 150 million dollars more than what they estimated the value of a Target company today now part of the cynical part of you is probably saying they must have known what they were doing that they wanted to get the deal done so it might be the case but I really don't think so I've seen M A teams value companies and here's that any of you working nominating here's what happens the team splits halfway Midway through the courses half the team works on estimating cash flows the other half of the team Works in estimating this contracts and there's always a deadline don't ask me why midnight on Friday night 11 55 p.m the two groups come together you have five minutes left the discontinence we have a discount rate nobody stops and asks who's this country do you cost of equity cost to Capital you have a discount rate the other side said we have the cash flows this is like a marriage made in heaven let's bring them together in a spreadsheet this is how inconsistencies happen this is just the tip of the iceberg today we're going to start talking about currencies you estimate your cash flows in Rubles your discount rate has been rubles you could estimate them in Euros your discount rate has be yours consistency is something that we're going to come back to over and over again and this is the start of the process now I have to tell you who the two people who ran first Boston's m a department in the late 70s were there were two men Bruce wasserstein and Joe perella if you remember the terrible things I said about wasis team perella you could it's how these two men were punished for their massive mistakes and valuation right they got to start their own Boutique Investment Bank that gave M A advice God help us they just start really bad advice for a decade now they got punished for dishing out really bad advice Ten Years Later Dresner bag decided to buy was 16 perella for their valuation expertise I cannot even make up this crap if I tried but there's no justice in this world you can do terrible things but if you get deals done guess what you become a hero Bruce watsonstein was proud about the fact that he got deals done and he succeeded at that level but my point is often in valuations we look at the cash flows we look at the discontract we don't ask that connecting question are the discard rates consistent with the way cash flows are estimated so file that away because I know some of you will take M A classes and I've seen M A classes where professors actually make the mistake of getting the discount rate wrong because it's I think part of the problem is we think of cost to Capital as a cost of raising money and that's one way to think about it but the cost of capital use in discounting has nothing to do with that that definition of cost of capital it's a it's got to do with a risk-adjusted discount rate based on the cash flows you're discounting it's a very different use I called the cost of capital the Swiss army knife of Finance it shows up all over the place in different contexts and if you're not careful you can use it in the wrong context so we'll come back I did just one session in m a because I don't think there's that much that's unique about m a but we'll come back and talk about a little bit more about this context and you know what the dangers are of so let's start on the first packet if you brought your first packet great if not not a big deal so today we're going to start the digging into intrinsic valuation I mean don't make this more glorious and more complex than it has to be an intrinsic value you value a business based on its cash flows based on its risk based on its growth you value it as a business as opposed to it in pricing you look at what other people are paying for similar things you know so if you think about you know for for any cash flow generating asset discounted cash flow evaluation is just a way of estimating intrinsic value much of the architecture of DCFS has been created in the last century in fact the very first book that talks about discounted cash flow evaluation is a book by John Williams 1937. but were people estimating intrinsic value before 1937. I hope so intrinsic valuation predates DCF so you don't need a DCF to do an intrinsic valuation just a way of thinking how much do I pay so one way to think about intrinsic valuation is when if you're a believer in intrinsic valuation I ask you how much will you pay for a building that's a rental building you don't look at the price of the building what other people are paying you basically say what will my rental income be what will I get after it it's it's a mindset and with that mindset the question is how does it play out and I'm going to give you the way in which it's usually presented a discounted cash flow evaluation and I'll also give you a variant that's almost never done and you're going to see what or it's never done right you're going to see very quickly why in traditional discounted cash flow valuation the value of an asset is the present value of the expected cash flows on the asset well you discount those expected cash flows at a risk adjusted discount rate so in the numerator what do you have expected cash flows in in at least in this utopian world you're looking at every conceivable scenario the expected cash flow should reflect so there's no afterthought right where after you've done evaluation you say oh by the way this could happen it should be in your expected cash flows so traditional DC evaluation the numerator is an expected cash flow with your best unbiased estimates of cash flows and the denominator of a risk adjusted this country there's a variant on discounted cash flow valuation that you almost never see done right well instead of discarding expected cash flows at a risk-adjusted discard rate you discount what are what are called certainty equivalent cash flows to understand certain equivalent cash flows I'm going to ask you about a TV show that hardly anybody seems to have seen anymore it's called it's called let's make a deal with Howie Mandel have you ever seen this show if you haven't I'll describe what it's not a complicated show here's how it goes so you're a contestant I'm Howie Mandel I call you up on the stage there are two suitcases on and there are actually two suitcases they're actually designed that way one suitcase has a million dollars the other suitcase is nothing and here's how The Show Goes Howie Mandel offers money to you to walk away from the deal now if you think if you're completely risk neutral how much would he need to offer you to walk away from the deal what's the expected value million dollars one yep 500 000 right but if you watch the show people walk away at three fifty thousand three seven are they being irrational absolutely not why are you settling for 400 000 because you have it in your hand it's guaranteed as opposed to an expected value that 400 000 you accept as a certain cash flow in exchange for that expected cash flow 500 is called a certain equivalent you see why people don't want to do this in valuation you want to Value coca-colias what do you do you get the expected cash flows the next 10 years then Howie Mandel comes in and says you know what the expected cash flow in year one is 1.2 billion what would you expect as a guaranteed cash flow depending on how risk-averse you are you might say 800 900 million and you replace each of the expected cash flows with a guaranteed equivalent cash flow if you do that and it's a big if you now have cash flows that are in a sense certain equivalent they're like guaranteed cash flows what's the discount rate that I should apply on those cash flows then should be the risk created one of the biggest challenges in teaching this class is people who read too much Warren Buffett because he says so many things it's not his fault he's when you talk and talk and talk and you go to 100 Years of annual meetings that I'm overstating but you know 50 years of Berkshire and he said things that sometimes come back in this class and one of the things is that he doesn't like betas and he doesn't like you know the Kappa and he's actually extrapolated from that I know somewhere along the way he said I don't even adjust my discontract so of course you end up in the class and you say well Warren Buffett values companies using a risk-free rate as a discount rate why are using a risk-adjusted discount rate and I said look go back and look at what he claims he's discounting because he never shows a full but he does mention that he does he counts only those earnings that he thinks accountable he doesn't like speculative earnings he doesn't like things that might or might not happen in in a sense what's he doing he's doing a Howie Mandel on the cash flows right he's coming up with some way of adjusting the cash flows it's very fuzzy it's but that's basically what he's doing he's saying why shouldn't I do that if you do that don't double count right I've seen analysts say I'm going to count only the earnings just like Warren Buffett but I'm going to use the risk adjusted this contract make your choice if you decide to go with a certain equivalent route that you're going to do it and then work it through it's not easy to do I wouldn't do it can you imagine trying to get a certain equivalent cash flow for a Tesla I would drive myself crazy and the information you need to get a certain equivalent is exactly the same information you need to get a discount rate and I'll take the world trodden path over the likely trodden path every single time so what I'd like to do is actually use that present value equation now often novel you know when I valued a dhani two days ago or Tesla a couple of weeks ago one of the pushbacks I get is I get accused to being a valuation theorist academic none of these are supposed to be complementary words terrorists academic basically no and I had to laugh because I know how little Theory there is in this class you know what you you want to see the entire theory for this class it's right there one equation the entire class and I'll give it away is about coming up with better estimates of expected cash flows and finessing the discount rate to bring in Risk that's it but I'm going to use that equation to kind of extract some basic lessons about intrinsic valuation you guys are sitting a little far away from me so this game is going to be a little difficult I have to approach you so I want somebody to be my guinea pig you want to be my guinea pig on this trust me you're going to look really good after you play along with me just so here's what I'm going to do I want everybody to see what I have a twenty dollar bill I'm going to put it into the envelope it's nothing else there right okay no my sleeves are all rolled up I'm not David Copperfield so you know are you ready for the question you saw me put twenty dollars in there right how much would you pay for this envelope that's what most people say first rule in valuations if you pay twenty dollars for an envelope for twenty dollars what do you walk away with from this transaction you basically get an envelope but look at how tattered it is I kind of written all over I stole it from upstairs first rule in valuation if you know the value of something start your bidding at a lower number or higher number good none of your destiny Bankers then because you said higher your life as a banker go for it right because you don't know what disease I have maybe I can't read numbers maybe I put the 20 and think I have a dollar bill in there but I'm going to make this interesting so let's it is a simple asset to Value right so if I open it up to bidding you know sooner or later I'm going to converge on twenty dollars so let's say the envelope is now valued at twenty dollars because there's twenty dollars in I'm going to add something to this envelope and I want you to tell me how much you'd pay for the envelope after I had what does this say what's a word on there control I'm going to add control to December you now have twenty dollars plus control remember the envelope was worth twenty dollars before I added control to it how much future as a banker just shattered you know why I didn't go at control right if you ever worked in m a anywhere what's the rule you value a Target company and add a 20 control premium why in fact a few years ago I did this for a group of Goldman Sachs bankers it's a re-education camp they're experienced Bankers they brought them back none of them wanted to be there I put this envelope up one of the bankers decides he's going to be clever he says I'll bet 25. you know what I did I sold in the envelope he complained I said now that it's your own money you feel the pain right because what did he do he paid five dollars for a three by five card that I stole from upstairs and wrote the word you know how much it cost me to write that absolutely nothing it's just a word you can see where this is going but let's keep going what does this say Synergy let's put that in there how much is it worth it's a three by five card with the word Synergy I can go crazy with this what does it say if you're a marketing person you're doing somersault that this is amazing brand name I'll put that in there I could write ESG and put that in there sustainability and put it in there I call these weapons of mass distraction let me repeat that again Mass distraction you know why I call them Weapons of Mass distraction because these words show up right after you valued a company and people want to pay more to control what about synergy how about ESG but I'll give you two magic words one that continues to work as long as business has been around this world's been the way in which you get the extra premium the other used to work well but to show you how weapons of mass destruction can turn against you it's gone from being a source of a premium to perhaps a source of a discount so here's the first of those words you want to read this to the class what does it say strategic that word is the most dangerous word in business it means right the number be doing what you want to do anyway you're trying to sell your business find a strategic buyer you know what strategic buyers do they make up their mind they want to buy a company before they show up at the bargaining table whenever I hear those strategic my antennas start starts quivering you know what exactly are you trying to bypass here the other word that used to add zeros to your valuation it was a word that doesn't work as well anymore can you read this to the class what does it say China until about three years ago you were building a business it was worth 10 billion the buyers acting all I can't pay more than 10 billion I'm a candy buyer only to say but where in China magically zero start to pop up in your evaluation it's amazing what a billion people seems to do to Common Sense three years ago China was a source of extra zeros the problem with the weapons of mass destruction is what works at one time might not work at another so I'm going to State a proposition that stood me in good stead whenever I run into these issues I call it the it proposition sounds fancy but here's what the it proposition says if it does not affect the cash flows and it does not affect risk it cannot affect value you're saying what's it you name it let's go back and review the words that I put into that envelope control forget about what Bankers do in the 20 premium what is the true value of control what do you get to do when you have control anybody want to give that a try what is exactly yeah yeah more than I say you can change the way a business is around right so the value control here's what I need to do I need to Value the company twice once with the existing Management in place with what they do and once with you in place with all the things you claim you can do and assuming your plans have some basis the difference in values should be the value of control so if Nelson Pelt said value control at Disney I'm going to Value Disney run by Bob eicher and value Disney again with Nelson Pelt but he better be specific about what he plans to do with the company and that difference should be the value of control you know how powerful that concept is because here are the implications if you have a company that's already perfectly managed and perfectly run what's the value control zero if you're a company that's abysmally managed in abysmily run it could be a hundred percent who makes up these rules of thumb of 20 and says that's the quality of control what's the value of synergy and don't give me the 2 plus 2 is equal to five crap that you hear in class that two plus two is not five it's four but the value of synergies two businesses come together and they're able to do things they could not have done as Standalone companies can I value centers yes but you got to describe what the Synergy is as higher growth is it lower cost and my job is to convert that into earnings and cash flows and risk and say this is the value of synergy not use it as a plug variable to explain away the difference between what you pay and what's something you value that it's a value for brand name any other marketing class all the time everything has a brand name you ask me every Company claims to have a brand name you know the power of a brand name is you get to charge a higher price for exactly the same product I know it sounds simplistic but if you want to see Brad name at play walk into the Dwayne read at the End of the Street walk into the painkiller aisle check out the bare aspirin that's still there on the shelves and right next to it is a generic version of aspirin exactly the same drug but the bare aspirin sells for more and think of how many people buy the bare aspirin they're not being crazy that is the power of a brand name a little late in this class we're going to use that inside and saying if you have a brand name it's got to show up as pricing power and Plus pricing power you have to have higher modules higher margins I can value a brand name three years ago when I first I you know the way I described my ESG journey is I started because I was curious and after I discovered there was nothing there I was cynical and I'm reaching the point of contempt at this point whenever I hear the ESG talk come up because there's nothing there if a concept could be toxic and empty at the same time yes you just pulled it off but I'll tell you what led me to that place I heard all this talk from you know you've heard Larry Fink say being good increases value I said really okay where is it is it in higher growth is in higher margins is it in lower risk so that's the way I looked at the research it says show me because I'm I'm willing to listen Maybe and being good increase the value of some companies absolutely Patagonia probably benefits from a tsg label because what does it do sell overpriced outerwear to guilty yuppies right I mean that's a reality you sell forward and you are convinced the world you're saving the world by spending 400 in this pack I mean you might love your Patagonia but don't tell me you've saved the world because you put on a Patagonia jacket so could Patagonia be using ESG as a way yeah but for Nike with a 33 billion dollar Revenue instead of a billion dollar Revenue there are costs and trade-offs right if you decide you're not going to sell in a country better not be China because that's cut off 30 of your market right there that's why when the when the Russian invasion of Ukraine happened a lot of ESC people are beating that just look no this is why now we teach the Russians a lesson we'll no we can debate that but the question asked was if China had invaded Taiwan would you be as willing to say I'm going to abandon China because you know there are trade-offs so if you're going to talk about value show me show me the substance even words like strategic we need to push back what's strategic about it where are the benefits going to show up so that's the it proposition the second proposition is don't be a worse proposition basically you know people who you know I've I've seen people give up on valuation why because there's too much uncertainty remember statistics when you have too much uncertainty doesn't mean you cannot make estimates it means your estimates come with more noise if you let uncertainty be a reason for not not valuing companies I'll tell you exactly where you'll end up you'll be valuing craft times and Coca-Cola over and over again for the rest of your life because you feel certain this is one reason when Warren Buffett said I don't invest in anything I don't understand I said be very careful because the older you get the less of the world you're going to understand it's the nature of getting old right what the heck are these kids doing they're watching Tick Tock videos bite dance must be worth nothing it that's absurd sometimes you got to accept the fact that you don't know as much but you still have to make your best estimates so let's say you take my advice you pick a company with a lot of uncertainty you sit down to Value it and you notice you have cash flows in your one that are negative why because it's still growing cash flows in year two are negative cash flow and your cash flows turn out to be negative all the way through because they have a business model that's unfixable you see why would you start a company if that's the case people do stupid things and other people Supply these stupid people with capital to keep making the stupid things bigger remember Movie Pass probably the dumbest business idea I've ever seen show up those of you don't remember movie pass it was a business that was started but for 9.99 a month you could watch as many movies and movie theaters as you wanted 9.99 any of you guys gone to a movie in New York City what does it cost you to go in once like twenty dollars now but even if you were in Des Moines Iowa it'll cost you at 7.50 but you pay 9.99 you can go to 20 movies and Movie Pass would reimburse the theaters for as many movies and I remember thinking about saying how the do these guys make money and the answer is they did not so I actually watched the CEO of MoviePass on on TV it was on CNBC and he's trying to explain why he said the average American goes to one movie a month we're charging 99. the average theater in the U.S charges only six dollars you know you can drown in a lake that has an average depth of only six inches averages can be extremely deceptive but you know how stupid this argument is because it's not the average American who's buying movie pass as a selection by it there's a self-selection right you know who buys MoviePass people like my oldest son who love the movies they go to 20 movies a month you're on a pathway bankrupt see the only question is when and how you know and how deep is the hole going to be but think how many billions of capital went into the movie pass because before people came to this recognition so let's say you picked a movie pass like company you have negative cash flows for the next 10 years and forever and then you come and ask me how much should I pay for this company I'm going to slap you around the face say wake up you don't need a valuation class you know that somebody offers you an endless stream of negative cash flows they should be paying you not the other way around be amazed at how many emails I get to know I'm valuing a money losing company I expect to lose money forever how much should I pay for the company come on guys no discounted cash flow model is needed here so I'm going to call that the dura proposition we have negative cash flows as far as the eye can see just let it go and if somebody insists you take it they should be paying you which makes me my final proposition this is a much more nuanced proposition so yeah is it good or bad what does it depend on if I forget about the corporate the core business is going to be profitable whether they do this or not so this is all about and that's actually a good quiet because whenever you focus on the company focus on what moves what doesn't so the core business is profitable whether they do this or not that's not changing so what are they doing that that raises issues they're investing in a new business right is that going to be value-adding value destructive or value neutral you know what's going to determine that forget about the outings it's how much you put into those businesses what you're going to get in return you know earnings cash flows forever I mean think of it like a project right when you take a positive Net Present Value project what happens your value it goes up so if you go into new businesses and you earned roughly your cost of capital guess what you get bigger but your value is not going to change if you're going to new business you earn more than your cost of capital then your value is going to go up and you go into new businesses and earn less than your cost of capital I don't care how big you're getting you're actually destroying that so that's going to be the driver for all growth right it's not just whether you have a cash generating business or not but that's going to be the question you ask about every single investment that a company makes but when I talk about Nuance let's say that you've picked a company and you estimate cash flows next year they're negative year two still negative you're three negative but it's getting less negative and as you go through time the cash flows get less negative flip into positive cash flows and become really could a company like that be worth a lot I hope so because what is the type of company that's going to have this this these types of cash flows well you know if you think about company biotech I heard but what do they share in common they're young companies could be infrastructure companies could be biotech companies could be a you know social media companies it's not the sector that makes it happen it's a fact that they're young companies that are putting in the money now and hoping for a payoff in the future we're going to value a few young companies here I'm going to Value Amazon in 2000. maybe Peloton three years ago or now and you you know what you're going to see in common with these young companies negative cash flows in the first four five six years that's a feature it's called Cash burn and people drink their hands oh my God that's cash burn but cash bud is a feature these companies it's not a bug it's what you have to live through to get to the promised land and it's not going to be easy right because you're burning through cashews would I survive will I survive so we're going to factor those issues in but this notion that discounted cash flow valuation is designed for nice mature companies misses the point the process itself is incredibly flexible it's our discomfort that makes it rigid if you insist that your cash flows have to be positive if you insist that there's got to be more certain in estimates you are restricting yourself but it's not the problem at the model it's a problem with you in the way you're applying the model so let's very quickly revisit what I started the class I said if you have cash flows to equity cash flows after debt payments use the cost of equity value the equity if you have cash flows the entire business pre-dead cash flows use a cost to Capital discounted you got the value of the firm and then if you subtract out debt you should come up with value equity we're going to come back and examine what we should be subtracting out to get to Value Equity but let me give you a very quick preview you've taken cash flows The Firm pre-dead cash flows you've discounted them at the cost of capital you come up with the value of the business you want to say how much your Equity is worth I'm going to give you a few choices and what you can subtract out and you tell me which of those choices is the right ones so you got cash flows of firm discounted the cost of capital you come up with the value of the business should you be subtracting out only long-term debt should be subtracting our total debt should be subtracting out all libraries in our balance you can see very different numbers right total debt long-term debt total debt all liabilities will include accounts payable supply of credit or maybe whatever you call debt we needed your cost of capital because remember earlier to get a discard trade across the capital you had to use weights for debt Network I'm not going to give you the answer right now but I want you to start because I've seen this content cash flow valuations that subtract all of these right and you get very different answers for your equity but I'm going to give you a small snapshot of how to think about that and when we talk about leases we'll talk about why this is relevant I've treated leases as debt for 30 years accountants came to that recognition a realization about three years ago 2019. so when I value firms I treat leases as debt when I do cost to Capital and it's got mixed effects right use treat leases debt your cost to Capital often go down because you're using more debt which is a good thing right from a DCF I get a bigger value for the business but then I subtract our debt I include Lisa says that because if I counted it as that when I did my cost of capital I have to count it as debt when I subtract it up it's a consistency issue right again consistency plays out you can't change your mind on what to call debt when you go from cost to Capital subtraction there are things like underfunded pension obligations that we have to come back and deal with what do we do with those what if your company's a target of a lawsuit because as an equity investor all of those are concerns that hang over your head right and we'll come back and delve into ghosts but let's say you do it right you take the value of the business you subtract out the right amount of debt you come up with the value of equity remember you could have taken the equity and valued it directly as well right taking cash flows to equity and discount the cost of equity I'm going to ask you two questions you you're welcome to give me two different answers would you like to get the same value for your Equity using both approaches you're an investor right you just decide but imagine if the two approaches gave you different answers what the heck are you going to do with it buy with an equity approach I don't think when you go on Schwab online it says buy did you use an equity approach we credit you with that your buyers sell right so at least in Terry you'd like the numbers to be the same no matter which approach you use to me it's one of the toughest challenges in discounted cash flow evaluation to see if those numbers can Butch and if they don't converge what the reason for the non-convergances I told you about weekly challenges your first weekly challenge is going to come this week it's going to probe that but I'm going to give you a setup example so you can see how this process works and to do this here's what I'm going to do I'm going to take a company I'm going to show you my estimated cash flows we know we haven't gone into the details of how it is but let's say I've done the Dirty Work I give you cash flows to equity cash flows left over after debt payments and cash flows The Firm I also give you a cost of equity for this company 13.625 and I tell you that this firm and it borrows money has to pay ten percent pre-tax now if you've done Corporate Finance you know why there's a distinction between pre-tax costed and after tax cost and much of the world interest is tax deductible and if you borrow money at 10 with the tax benefits of debt you got to factor in that tax benefit in this case with a 50 tax rate and you borrow money at 10 you're effectively borrowing money at five percent after taxes so you got a 13.625 cost of equity of five percent after tax cost of debt this is going somewhere so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to take this company and first value its Equity directly what does that mean I take cash flows to equity and discount them at the cost of equity let's try that cash flows to equity discounted the cost of equity gives me a value of 1073 million for the equity so I'm being consistent I'm doing the right discount rate I'm not pulling a first Boston yeah now of course I could value the entire business right to Value the business what do I need I need a cost to cap to get a cost to Capital I take the cost of equity in the after tax cost of debt and I need weights for debt and equity and the weights we tend to use in valuation tend to be market value rates there's a circularity I will come back and talk about that later in the class but let's say the market value of equity is 1073 million I've concocted this example to give me the answer I want and I want you to think about what it is about this example that's going to lead me to where I'm going to go but my caustic capital in a weighted average basis is 9.94 percent I discount my cash flow to the firm at that 9.94 cost of capital the value that I get is a present value is 1873 million but remember that's a value The Firm I subtract out the 800 million in debt magically I get exactly the same value for equity I have delivered your utopian message right get the same value but I had to place um assumption games to get there and this week's challenge is going to pose that issue what it is that I'm assuming in this example that led me to the same answer and it's not difficult you start digging so what am I assuming but the reason I want you to do that is people do this without even thinking about it they make implicit assumptions and I wanted to make those assumptions explicit could I have screwed up on this absolutely I could have taken the cash flows and mismatched them and as I said that's a first principle if you take cash flows to equity you've got to use the cost of equity if you take cash flows of firm you got to use the cost of capital and in this case if I'd mismatch I'm going to get horrendous mistakes right I take cash flows to equity and discount them at the cost of capital I did what I what what first Boston with Kenneth got I'm going to over value the company by 175 million not because I got the cash flows wrong with the discount rate wrong they're both right but they don't match each other if I took cash flows the firm and discount the cost of equity I understate the value of the entire business right because I've used too high a discount rate of those cash flows but the problem is you have no idea what you're valuing right if you've used cash flows to the firm and you used to yeah you you don't even know whether you value for firm or Equity I've seen people actually take cash flows The Firm discounted the cost of equity gets so completely lost at this forget to subtract out the debt in which case you massively overvalued equity and if you subtract out the debt you're going to undervalue equity there are lots of different Pathways to hell here if you mismatch cash flows and discount rates taking that pause upfronting am I matching right is well worth the trouble so here's what I'd like to do I'd like to lay the baby steps for doing intrinsic valuation lay out the picture and start at least talking about the estimation process that's coming so every discounted cash flow model no matter what matches you do you got cash flows you got a discount rate you take a present value so in a generic discounted cash flow model you've expected cash flows you got a risk adjusted this country to get a present value but there's one mechanical detail that I still haven't tied up if you remember the equation for the value of an asset I said if the present value the expected cash flows over the life of the asset right so we have a 10-year asset you could produce the estimate cash flows for 10 years 15 years and here we run into a little bit of a estimation problem with publicly traded companies at least in theory how long can a publicly traded company last forever right do you open up a corporate chart it tells you when it was founded it doesn't tell you you're saying empirically that's not true companies wind up you're right companies but at least interior company could keep going and going and going and going so to value a company what do I need to do I need to estimate expected cash flows Forever This is my vision of Health an Excel spreadsheet that never ends right that's basically what forever looks like so it's natural for people to say can I stop now how about right now but you can't just stop and forget what happens after that point in time you got to put closure so I'm going to tell you when you can stop and what assumptions you have to make and you're not going to like the assumption you can stop estimating cash flows if you're willing to make an assumption and the Assumption has to be that beyond that point in time your cash flows grow at a constant rate forever scary work forever you know what that buys you it buys you an infinite Series in mathematics and 200 years ago mathematicians solved for the value of that series in finance we stole that equation for mathematics we act like we invented this but this is that famous terminal value equation you see in every discounted cash flow evaluation and I'm not talking about the bankers version which is a completely screwed up version where you lose eight times Epitaph version that you see in a DCF where you have the cash flows and your 11 divided by R minus 0 are the most dangerous equations in valuation because you can misuse it that's what you do put in closure but to do that what do you have to assume the cash flows grow at a constant rate forever now I'm going to say something that I get an amazing amount of pushback on and I'm surprised because this isn't a finance or an economics point it's a mathematical point which is when you talk about a growth rate forever that growth rate comes with a cap another cap is it cannot be greater than the growth rate of the economy in which you're in you see why this is a math issue not a finances you already have two numbers one is low number one's a high number you let the low number grow seven percent here the high number grow at four percent here and you let them both keep growing what's going to happen eventually the loan number is going to hit and it won't stop right the low number will keep going every company at some point in time will it what I call a scaling wall we're going to talk about when that will be for a company it's one of the big issues with Tesla right will they hit the wall at 400 billion or a trillion is going to make a big difference in your valuation Groupon hit it at 20 billion Walmart headed like 450 billion but every company eventually it's a wall and it's a good thing because from a valuation perspective that's when you put closure so if you think about the structure of a model there are the cash flows for a period five years ten years there's a terminal value that kicks in only when you tell me your company's a mature company my definition of mature company is a company that grows at a rate less than or equal to the growth rate of the economy it can be less than but it can't be greater then and a risk adjusted this concrete now of course you can get variants on discounted cash flow models in a layout the the most common variance the three most common variants I told you about the 1937 discounted cash flow valuation paper it was about valuing equity and it's focused on cash flows Equity but at a very strict definition of what a cash flow Equity was nearby shares in a publicly traded company what's the only cash flow that's tangible that they can actually say that's my cash flow equity dividends right everything else is kind of Illusion I can do all the free cash flows I want but the dividend discount model is a special case of an equity valuation model you take dividends you discount them at the cost of equity come up with the value of equity but when you do that what are you assuming that companies pay out what they can afford to in dividends do that there's some might but we know beyond any reasonable questioning that most companies don't pay out what they can afford to in dividends and here's how we know is a cash balance in your company right you have an 80 billion dollar cash balance don't even tell me with a straight phase that you've been paying out what you can afford to because this isn't manner from Heaven that showed up in your balance sheet it's a direct consequence of holding back so I'm going to give you an alternative to David it's a company like Google you know can pay dividends chooses not to in fact many tech companies have decided not to pay dividends at all they'll use BuyBacks over time to return cash let's estimate potential dividend sounds complex right but what's potential dividend it's whatever cash flow is left over after meeting all your debt needs and capex and working capital and can we estimate that for a company that's what's in the statement of cash flows right you give me a statement of cash flows I can tell you potential dividend in like three or four minutes this isn't rocket science so the second approach to valuation is replace actual dividends with potential dividends free cash flow Equity it's still an equity valuation so your discount rate is still going to be a cost of equity and what do you get as a present value will be the value of equity in a company could that value be different from your dividend discount model absolutely if you take a couple like Google you might get a very low value from the dividend discount model because they choose not to pay dividends your free cash flow Equity model will fix and the third way you can estimate cash flows is as pre-dead cash flows free cash flow to the firm you did this condiment the cost of capital what do you get as a present value will be but every every DCF model whether it's dividends of free you're doing the same thing right you're estimating cash flows during a finite period you're assuming constant growth beyond that and you're using a discount rate that reflects what you're so I can actually take these models and show them as pictures and for the moment take them as pictures because we haven't talked about the details you asked me to value a company based on a dividend discount model I get focused on dividends I look at what they paid as a percentage of earnings as dividends and pests called a payout ratio and my entire forecasting is built around what will earnings be in the future what will the payout ratio be in the future I get expected dividends I discount them back at the cost of equity and people feel more comfortable with the dividend discount model you know why because you're taking the dividend as a fact you're not questioning it you're saying that's three dollars in dividends I don't have to estimate cash flows I've taken a load off your shoulders but you have to recognize there's a consequence for doing it you're trusting companies to pay out what they can so in a dividend discount model you could expect dividends you discarded the cost of equity come up with the value of equity in the company you're done no cleaning up to do when you do free cash flow Equity we estimate potential dividend you can be a little you can bring in a little more finesse to the game in what sense remember when a company has you know a business it's in and as a cash balance both generate income right the cash balance generates interest income the business generates net income and up you know so if you're doing free cash or Equity valuation you can say look I'm going to keep the cash separate why am I going to you know why do I want to mess up my valuation with something that's easy to Value you take your non-cash net income the net income you're getting from your non-cash assets you come up with a free cash flow Equity you discount them at the cost of equity you come up with the value of the equity in the non-cash assets and then you can add cash on say look I'm done little trickier than a dividend discount model because now you're making estimates and finally if you look at a foot you know free cash or the firm model you're now looking at pre-dead cash flows everything is focused on pre on on growth in those cash flows the determinal values based on growth in that cash flow your discount rate is a cost to Capital I know we're right you know these pictures just blur you know blur together but I want you to put the pictures next to each other so you can see that every discounted cash flow model is built around the same structure finite period of cash flows a cash flow is growing at a constant rate forever after that a discount rate that reflects the cash flows and a present value with cleaning up especially when you value a firm there's a lot of cleaning up to do right if you value the business based on operating income you have cross Holdings you have cash you got to bring that into the game because you can't just lead them to the side so we'll spend an entire session on tying up Loose Ends when you do firm valuation because there are a lot of new sense to go so let's spend some time on process last Friday if you ask me what I know about the adani group I'd have said I've heard about them I've heard rumors about them I've never looked at the company I don't have any idea and that would have been the truth so Saturday morning when I sat down I said look after value the company can't value the company with nothing so guess what the first thing I did was I downloaded the history easier now than it was 20 years ago because downloading the historical data meant going into s p Capital IQ it's a nag of if you haven't signed up yet you know get that access to Capital IQ it's an amazing data resource and I downloaded the data for the entire life of the company from 2002 through 2022. so it downloads all of the income statements all of the it's it's overkilled right so you're saying what do I do with this when you look at past data and this is not just true for the learning group but for the your company you pick you're looking at the LA past data not because you're interested in the past but because you might get clues about the future right that's why we look at the past and what are the questions you're trying to get answers for you're trying to get answers of how quickly has my company grow and with the authority group it was immense the revenues that jumped tenfold over the last 10 years as they went from infrastructure business to infrastructure business I'm learning something about growth and I'm focusing on Revenue growth because Revenue growth captures the growth of operations better than income group I also wanted to see how profitable they are so I computed things like profit margins again I never compute a ratio unless it's helping me answer questions and for those of you at my adani post they're not a profitable company their margins are 3.6 percent and it's not because they're a young growth companies because they're in an infrastructure business you're in ports you're in airports you have transmission lines these are not 50 margin businesses these are five six seven percent margin businesses so they're fast growth but their profitability is lag now the final question is how the heck did they increase their revenue stand forward in infrastructure business what do you have to do you got to invest money so again I'm looking at the past to see how much did they invest to get into these businesses and where did they get the money it's in the financial statements right that's you and with there's already group they had huge amounts of reinvestment and almost 95 of it came from debt okay none of these are meant as a good or a bad thing I'm learning about the company why because my job is to forecast the future I'm going to use the past as the basis for this but I'm also going to look at now what is the rest of the sector look like if you're a company making 3.6 margins in a sector where everybody else makes 30 margins I'm going to stop and ask well is there hope here could you go to 30 margins is the economies of scale that are going to kick in so you look at your company you look at the industry and then after you're done you got to leave your safe spot because right up till then it's all about looking at the past you can always blame the accountants but if you're forecasting the future guess what you have to make your best estimates so what did I asked me to I assume that they would continue their path of strong Revenue growth why because they're focused on they want to grow and their political connections might help them on this so the growth is there I don't think the margins have much room to run I did allow margin to improve over time because infrastructure Investments take a while to mature you know margins tend to improve but they're not going to improve to 30 40 50 I stopped at seven Which is higher than the industry average global industry average for infrastructure companies about five to six percent I'm letting them have higher margins again perhaps the political connection competitive Advantage is coming into play but only so much room to run and will they need to reinvest to get this growth absolutely so I had to build in a reinvestment that reflect that so when you're forecasting the future you're taking what you learned from the past and you're trying to make your best estimates for the future and trust me you're going to be uncomfortable you should be right because you're trying to play God saying how do you know you're right I'll save you the trouble you're definitely wrong but so is everybody else trying to Value the company you're making your best judgments now I'll take you to two Pathways you can use when you forecast cash flows in one you start with operating income or as McKinsey likes to call it no plaid but lots of different names but start with operating income and you worked out you know when you can do that is there no company with stable margins you have a company in stable margins the reason you can start with operating income is growing at the same rate as Revenue so why bond is starting with the top line if your margins are always nine or ten percent there are very few companies in the world with stable margins so we're buying a Coca-Cola crafts you can get away with this but if your margins are changing either up or down you have no choice but to start with revenues right you forecast the growth and revenues you have to bring in what you know about the company the market the competition you have to forecast margins again bring in what you know about the company the margins the competition and then you've got to forecast how much you need to reinvest to get that revenues and I'll give you metrics you can use to make that judgment but I wanted to think big picture you're starting with the top not because you have to but because in this case when margins are changing you have no choice but and in doing all of this you still have to answer that unanswered question is when will this company hit a brick wall when will its growth start to scale or not whether it's wet and in some businesses it'll be sooner rather than later so if your company is um Slovenian company and it says look we're going to stay in Slovenia you're going to hit a wall sooner rather than later because the market is small that's the advantage that a Chinese or an Indian company has right off the start right because the wall is further away you have a billion people the wall is further away your new value is zomato you have more potential than when you value a European food delivery company because you've got a billion people ordering food they're not doing it right now mostly because many of them can't afford to do it your potential Market gets much bigger but I want you to remember the reason we look at the password not because we like to compute ratios of the past because you could do that right you've seen people do financial analysis but their version of financial analysis take that past data and and basically bludgeon it by basically estimating pretty much every ratio known demand but your job is not to just look at the past you use the past to make forecasts for the future now you will need this card trade so we go through the process of attaching costs to equity and cost of debt but think again in Broad terms the cost of debt is the rate at which I could borrow money long term today what will it depend on it'll depend on the rate of level of interest rates outside the cost of debt for every company in the US has gone up by about two and a half to three percent in the last year even if nothing has changed why because the t-bond rate the base is going up so you have to come up with risk free rates but you also have to come up with default spreads which might increase or decrease depending on how risky a company is your discount rates have to reflect the world you're in now not some version of the world you'd like to be in so you can't normalize things and make your company look you know put yourself in a macro environment that you feel more comfortable in because this is the environment you're in but when we do valuation it's all about the future and that's basically what I want to get started on is making those judgments for the future so let's start with some very basic consistency points yes so first when a company is making a transition what's the first thing that happens with historical data you got to trust it less right because it reflects the company as it used to be so if Twitter is going to go from being an ad based company to a subscription-based company I'm not saying that's the transition they're going to make you can have 50 years of history of their ad-based businesses but to make your forecast you're going to be looking at subscription-based business remember we talked about industry averages so when companies make transitions historical data will get weighted Less in your forecast and the businesses they're going to go in are going to play a much bigger role in estimating growth than margins and everything else so how much you can trust the past so there's this this mythology that we're valuing a company the long history it gets easy to value true a lot of the time the company long history that's making a transition guess what that history is kind of useless this is going to be a new company a different company so I think that when you have a company with a history that reflects a very different business model I mean take Peloton for the early part of its existence was a fitness equipment company that sold these expensive subscriptions to people but the equipment drove the subscription model during covet of course they offered a subscription model to people who didn't own pelotons and that became their fastest growing part of the business let's say looking forward you think the subscription portion of the business is going to expand and the equipment part is going to shrink and go away you don't want to wait historical data too much because it reflects a different business model so I think that when you have transitions it just means that you have fewer crutches you can't use pass data and extrapolate and that's good to know right because you don't want to be projecting out things based on past data if it's a very different business model yes okay what was it that uh Donald rums felt I mean he said some really strange things sometimes you'd have to play it out in your hands of what the heck does that mean I mean this was during the Iraq War and somebody talked about now with some you know uncertainties in the future you said he can't explain the unexplainable it's like like listening to Nasim Talib and he's had one drink too many so what exactly did he say no but basically you can bring into expectations only what's in on your radar so in 2019 if you ask me why didn't I bring covid into my heart it is because it wasn't even on my radar today when I value a hotel company if I don't bring in the expectation something like a pandemic could shut me down then I'm being improved so I think you can only estimate what you can and when there's something you cannot estimate can cut in both directions you just basically have to say look it's that's risk out of my hands I'm going to charge a higher discount rate up front for that risk so don't play the role of I'm going to forecast the unforecastable try to bring in things that nobody's ever thought about and that's why I'm not sure what I do with the Black Swan because when do we know there's been a Black Swan often after the fact right so we can talk about tail risk and how to bring them into valuation but you're not going to see new expected cash flows because if you could then it's not a Black Swan so let's start with three emphasizing the consistency point you give me cash flows Equity you got to use the cost of equity cash flow is the firm you've got to use the cost of capital starting this session going to Wednesday session I'm going to make a big deal about currency and being currency consistent and you're going to see this player for you estimated cash flows in dollars your discount rate has been dollars and in the process I'm also going to talk about the possibility that you could value a company in real terms what does that mean you basically estimate cash flows without inflation in them then you estimate a discard rate that doesn't have inflation in it's called a real valuation so let's step back in all of this what are we trying to do we have expected cash flows in the numerator every risk-adjusted discard rate at the denominator at the risk of oversimplifying things think of the ingredients that go into your discarded starts with the risk-free rate right it's almost impossible to do discounted cash flow evaluation if you can't identify what you can make on a guaranteed investment that's your risk credit that's going to depend on what currency you're doing evaluation you're valuing a company Turkish lira your risk free rate is going to be very different than if you valued in euros we'll talk about virus free rates that across currencies but that's your starting point second you need to be aware and bring in the price of risk in the market you know what I mean by that you're investing in equities that's a price that Equity investors are charging for investing equities we call it an equity risk premium we can talk about estimation challenges you face in coming up with the transcript that's the price of risk in the market nothing to risk pre-rate Equity risk women have nothing to do with your company but then I ask you is your company riskier than average or safer I'm asking a question about relative risk and that's going to depend on your business model right you said discretionary stuff you're risk it and if you sell non-discretionary step and we try to capture that as a relative risk measure if you get too many Finance classes what do you replace is relative risk measure with that you know it almost becomes yeah beta it's just a relative risk measure that's how I think about betas I don't give them some glory and put some modeling back it's just a relative a beta 1.5 means you're 1.5 times more risky than the typical company in the market so before we delve into estimating those I want to set the table for thinking about risk now once you've picked a company here's an exercise to go through let's start every conceivable thing that you're uncertain about and I'll tell you up front it's going to be a very long list right in fact if you try to list the things you're certain about I don't think there's even a single item on that list what do you feel certain about you know the t-bond rate today but it could be different tomorrow right and after you've made this list here's something I I find cathartic but actually it's very healthy evaluation I want you to put into buckets see what are you talking about I wanted to First classify that uncertainty into estimation uncertainty and economic uncerting I'll draw the contrast economic estimation uncertainty is uncertainty because you haven't done enough of your homework so if you're valuing Tesla and you don't know how many electric cars were sold in 2022 you said right you can go collect the data fix it that's estimation uncertainty more work more data will solve that economic uncertainty though no amount of research is going to make come up with an answer so if I ask you what percentage of cars in 2032 are going to be electric you can go through Google search in fact the more you look the more on the more uncertain you're going to get because this is about 10 years from now you're making a judgment and no amount of what I'm trying to tell you is when it's economic uncertainty working more collecting more data doing more research is not going to make that uncertainty go away and here's the bad news 90 of the uncertainty you face when valuing most companies is economic uncertainty there's a point I call this the karmic point where you have to say look I've done everything I can to the point I would reach too if you have a company you don't know Twitter who knows who's going to be running the company whether it's model you say I've done my best but going out and collecting more data is not going to make my valuation better I know we're almost running out of time but let me hit the other two groups your uncertainty can be micro uncertainty or macro uncertainty and I value Tesla which uncertainty do you think is greater what's micro uncertainty uncertainty about the company its management it's it's a lot of micro uncertainty at Tesla right there's some macro uncertainty as well as now how many people switched electric cars what are the regulations going to look like in contrast when you value adani there's a lot of macro uncertainty in this process how quickly will India grow how much will infrastructure investment look like you're saying who cares macro and certainly shows up in your discount rate micro uncertainty does not next session we'll talk about why micro uncertainties so you can feel very uncertain about who followed Elon Musk but that doesn't Transit into a higher discount rate and finally you can have discrete uncertainty or continuous uncertainty but continuous uncertainty it's uncertainty face every moment of every day right if you're a U.S company the European operations every time the dollar euro exchange rate changes your cash flows are effectively changing discrete uncertainty this uncertainty that doesn't happen does that when it does happen it could be potentially catastrophic the case of the adani group The discrete uncertainty worried about is hey what if there's default in some companies it might be nationalization risk risk that if they happen they don't happen very often thank God permanent they do can change the entire landscape so I'm going to leave you with that because on Wednesday we're going to talk about how you bring risk into evaluation it's going to be determined not by what you think about a company but what marginal investors in the company think about the company sounds counterintuitive but I'll start with that because that's going to give us the basis for every risk and return model 
please experience [Music] thank you again what about it here this room gets progressively colder the further into the day you get I've given up and trying to get temperature controlled work here this is like an extension of what investment Banks and businesses do and they have meetings I've always wondered what what's the objective here why do you keep the temperature at like 55 degrees and you know what their answer is right it keeps people awake but they're freezing to death so what if they're awake and they can't listen to you because they're too busy surviving so if you're cold complain to somebody don't complain to me I I I've given up on trying to get this temperature right but it is a cold room today I want to start with two things one is uh when I put the Tesla evaluation of the week last week I said let's make this a crowd valuation right so there were 89 of you maybe 93 of you who did the valuations and thank you for doing it so I pulled the evaluations up I decided to do a distribution and this might be pure coincidence but the middle of the distribution worked out roughly where I put out as my base case I mean I don't know the answer to this but what if I put out a base case of 180 do you think this distribution might be affected it's biased right it's not good or bad it's reality stock is actually trading at 200 today could that affect evaluation absolutely would you see the price Rises I must be missing something let me go and energy again what I'm trying to say is that it's you know it's something you've got to take as a given deal honestly with it rather than say no this is objective I don't do any of that stuff I don't let the market feedback affect me because it does so today's session we're going to talk about risk pre-rate so what I'd like to do is start start today's session with a test on risk free rates so let me set up this set the stage you're valuing a Brazilian company you've decided to Value any returns you can either value it in Brazilian realize or you can value it in US dollars there is pre-read in realizes seven and a half percent the risk-free rate in dollars is two and a half percent today's class we'll talk about why risk-free rates vary across currencies but the risk-free rate increase is much higher than the risk-free rate in dollars you have a choice of adding neither currency right different risk free rates in which currency will you derive a higher value for the company don't be too quick to jump in because it seems the answer is obvious but it might not be which currency will you get the higher value will you get it in U.S dollars because it has a lower risk free rate Brazilian realized because it has a higher risk free rate or should it not matter how many of you think it should be in US dollars okay you've given me an opening to increase the value of a company then right all I'm going to do is switch to another currency with a lower risk free rate so why stop at U.S dollars why not go to Japanese yet right would you like to get the same value with the two currencies it's the same company same point in time if you tell me it's cheap in dollars and expensive in three hours I'm not even sure what to do with that you see that if you get today we're going to talk about why using different currencies should not affect evaluation sounds completely irrational but we're going to crack what I call the currency code a code that seems to be a mystery to a lot of people doing valuation but we'll set it to the side second question and this is related to the first one we never use a currency you're doing your analysis in what are called nominal terms what does that mean you're trying to bring an expected inflation even though you might not do it explicitly into your cash flows through growth rates and expect future cash flows and into your discontract but you could choose to do your entire evaluation ignoring inflation entirely and that seems tempting at times when inflation is high and unstable say you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna ignore the pro I'm going to remove the problem that's called doing your analysis in real terms sounds fancy but you're essentially forecasting your cash flows as a company without inflation behind in at your back and getting a discount rate that's a real discount rate so I'm going to reframe the question asked about dollars and realize in terms of nominal versus real valuation everything has to be you can't selectively say I'll do my prices and if you got the real route inflation has to go out of everything right so you can choose to do the line item by line item if you think inflation is going to affect your cost differently from revenue so you can do the total cash flows and nominal and remove the inflate but inflation has to lead if it stays in the game it's not a real analysis would you like again if you'd like to get the same value if your company nominal in real terms I would the analysts who you know most used real analyzes where Latin American analysts until very recently almost all Latin American analysis was either done in US dollars or it was done in real touch the as analyst why are you doing it in real terms your answers because we don't like to deal with inflation but inflation is like having an elephant in your living room when it moves you will notice if you decide to do everything in real terms it looks like you've avoided the inflation bogeyman but you're going to see that it's going to come back in your analysis later one way or the other you're going to have to deal with inflation another aspect of rates and this is something especially in the last decade has made people tear their their hair out if you look at the last decade we've had really low interest rates right and if you ask most people the reason they give if you listen to CNBC the culprit is fed the FED is kept rates low it's one of the most absurd reaches you can think of sounds like a dude if that must be setting rates so this is a question we'll try to address it at have great stayed low in the last decade because of qe1 and QE2 and the Fed oh continue an experiment what did the FED had not existed in the last decade would rates have been low anywhere which means you've got to think about what keeps rates low what is it that drives rates because it can't be a Central Bank of moving a lever up and down right because if that were the case you would never have high rates they raise the central Banker adjust the rate sort we're missing something with this fed Obsession we're missing a lot of things with the FED Obsession in the last decade it's taken over common sense so we're going to talk about hey what role do fed what's the rate and maybe you can tell me this what's the only rate the FED actually sets it's a Fed function everything else is said by markets right the fact doesn't set U.S treasury rates it doesn't set mortgage rates so before you free card and you say that six percent mortgage payment don't go and do something rash at the FED they did not set the mortgage rate so we're going to talk about the transmission mechanism if one exists but in a Fed saying we're gonna have a higher fed funds rate that's what the fomc can do and whether rates then go up or down because the FED is raised or low because what's the story for this year what rates will do this year is going to depend on what the FED does it's part of that extension of that fed Obsession the FED is going to set range so I want to talk about what it is that's driving this is actually true I think a couple of last week the Federal Open Market Committee was meeting and in keeping it a Fed Obsession you know what's happened to markets or the Federal Open Market Committee meets the entire all markets come to a standstill it's like they're waiting for smokes you know how in the Vatican when they elect a new pope so Federal Open Market Committee meets in a closed room they present smoke signals black smoke means rates are going up white smoke means rates are going down and everybody else is waits for the smoke to come out If the Fed truly sets straight I understand that obsession but I'd like to dig a Little Deeper as to why rates were as low as they were final point and this is again something that is relatively recent in the last probably five six seven years there have been at least three or four currencies which have had negative risk credits and it makes us uncomfortable right because when you took your econ 101 class did you ever talk about rates being negative you always talked about present consumption over future consumption right and for many people this is the first time in their experience or any people anybody's experience that rates have been negative and when something is unusual people assume that it must be wrong and they've been trying to fix it European analysts for instance have often tried to replace the negative so when you think about negative rates one of the things I heard over the last decade is when rates turn negative you cannot do valuation I want to think about that for a moment what is it about rates turning negative that leads you to this conclusion that because you know what the extension of that is Red Top Value companies let's price and there were some people who did this in fact many people stopped doing valuation because rates turn negative there were another group that did something very human what's the part of the number that's troubling you the minus in the front right so easy to fix Cisco plus there's your problem you replace an they normalize traits it made them feel much better they took the minus two percent and say you know what I'll make it plus two percent my problems gone away are you giving me a landscape of fixing every money losing company right what do I do I take the losses them into profits what money losing company so today I want to talk about negative interest rates and I'm going to argue that they're unusual but they're not some strange phenomenon that should never happen we'll talk about what it is that causes rates to be negative and then what do you do in valuation when rates turn negative so lots on our agenda let's go back and get to the the main lecture note packet and let's continue our discussion of risk so if you remember last session I talked about all the different ways you can bucket risk right it can be micro risk or macro risk estimation risk or economic risk discrete risk of continuous risk today I want to lay the foundations for thinking about how much of the address should you show in a discontract so I'm going to start with a very basic statement that's going to sound completely counterintuitive not all risk matters so your urge might be look I'm exposed to a lot of risk let me bring into the discount rate but I'm going to argue that you before you take that leap step back and say maybe not all that risk matters you're saying why not because risk has to be seen not through your eyes or my eyes but Through The Eyes of the people who are pricing the company I'm going somewhere with this the risk you see in an investment is the risk it adds to your portfolio right so if you have 10 stocks in your portfolio add 11 stock you don't look at the level stock by itself you look at what your portfolio over what how much risk it adds to the rest of your portfolio that changes your perspective on risk because it means that the risk you bring into your cost of equity is the risk added to whatever portfolio you have the marginal invest in your company is an investor who's most likely to be able to set prices and I'll be quite honest I've never been the marginal investor in any company for a simple reason I'm not going to affect prices I just don't have enough money maybe you do but I don't which means if you don't have marginal invested you're talking about Investors with a lot of money who trade which effectively means that in most companies it's going to be some type of Institutional Investor right we can dance around this as much as we want it could be Vanguard for one company in State Street for another and BlackRock for another and those are investors who own not just one stock not just 10 stocks but often 30 or 40 or 50 stocks people often make modern portfolio Theory the enemy evaluation this has nothing to do with modern portfolio Theory right maybe they're all saying don't put all your eggs in one basket I don't think Harry Markowitz made that thing that probably goes back 800 years you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket that's an argument for is spread your bets have eight or ten stocks not just the one stock you like and the minute you do that the risk you measure will be the risk added on to a portfolio changes the way we think about risk we'll come back and talk about what are what about those special circumstances we have somebody who's completely undiversified who buys this one investment if you're a public market investor and you do that that's your problem I'm not going to come and bail you out but you can see why in private businesses this can happen right you're a doctor wants to buy a practice you're a young doctor you already have what a 400 000 loan from medical school you're not exactly flush with cash right you take whatever wealth you have and you put it all into this Medical Practice event you're the exact opposite of diversifying they're the risk you care about is everything that affects that practice so we're going to talk about what to do when you're not Diversified but we're going to start with the premise that we're looking at publicly traded companies you don't have to be Diversified but the marginal investors are Diversified you have to think about risk through that so with that lead set I'm going to give you a one-page two-minute summary of risk and return models because I have zero desire to go back and go through this over and over again you've seen enough classes on it some you know every risk and return model and finance is built on the premise that the only risk you build into a cost of equity is risk you cannot diversify right let's start with that statement the only difference is across the models is how they measure that risk that's not the oldest and still most widely used risk and return model and finance you go to Every Investment Bank every consulting firm it's a capital asset pricing model the cap app 1964 58 years old 59 years old it's showing its age but in the capital asset pricing model you measure that risk you cannot diversify with one number the beta but to get there we had to make some gigantic assumptions in the capital asset pricing model it turns out that the two big assumptions that drive the model is first there are no transactions costs so basically by share it costs you nothing we're close to that already right basically if you look at Robinhood charges you nothing Schwab online charges you 5.95 so that's not that huge in Assumption second you have to assume that you have no private information that's a euphemism for you can't pick stocks he said why do you need those two assumptions the argument for diversification is a common sense one right spread your bets every additional investment is basically making that firm specific risk gets smaller and smaller and that diversity diversification benefit exists when you're at the first stock the second stock the third stock the 51st stock the 501st stock but the benefit gets smaller and smaller as you get to be more and more Diversified right there's a benefit from going from the 10th stock to the 11th that's much greater than from 100 to 100. and normally we stop we stop for one of two reasons we stop because as the transactions cost we say you know the benefit has become too small I'm going to stop at 100 stocks and the second reason we stop is because nobody wants to be an average investor you don't get much say in cocktail parties you go and say I made the average return right we all want to beat the market we think we found a way to do it in other words we live in a world where whether it's true or not we believe we're bringing something special to the table you see why what the capital assumptions do I've removed the two reasons for stopping if I remove the two reasons for stopping what's going to be in your portfolio every single traded asset in the market that's all the cap I'm you need to know you've just derived the capital because once we all hold that portfolio with every single trade let's call it what should we call it is every single trade it has oh we call it the market portfolio how creative is that we all hold the market portfolio so the way we measure risk is how much risk will this stock has that's what a beta measures it's a cap M everything's caption Abate and we're capturing all kinds of Mark macro risk in there right that that one beta should capture inflation risk and interest rate risk and all the macro risk so about 14 years later you had a second model called the Arbitrage pricing model that says why are we trying to load it all up in one number why don't we allow for different sources of Market risk we're still in the same not the same notion of only the risk you can't do but let's estimate a bait against each one the Arbitrage pricing model you could have five betas but still five factors that affect all stocks and the factors were unnamed it was a statistical model that's why it's called an Arbitrage pricing model so what is facto one is it's Factor one not particularly intuitive right because who wants to pay a higher return or expect a higher return because you're exposed to facto and but you have no idea what it is and in the following decade people started to do research to put names on the factors the first factor is interest rate the second is the slope of the yield curve third is default spreads when you do that you've gone from an Arbitrage pricing model to a multi-factor model but you're working within the same template which is now you have five factors but they're named near beta is against each one and then about 20 years ago to research at the University of Chicago Chicago Gene Pharma and Ken friend said why are we even trying to get these models all we need to figure out is what kinds of companies earn high returns and what kinds of companies earn low returns over long periods do you see where they were going right they said our objective is to find out which companies are riskier risky and we assume that markets are roughly right the stocks that are on a high return should be riskier than stocks that earn low returns especially over long periods you've kind of given up on measuring risk but then you look for proxies your small companies earn higher returns and large companies therefore they must be riskier all the factor models we've seen in the last 20 years essentially use data to say hey the data tells us these companies earn high returns therefore they must be riskier there I've tried to compress 50 years of no risk and return theory in corporate finance into one page but to be quite honest everything Beyond this is going to be self-defeating there's nothing more in terms of icing you're going to get on the cake that's going to add to the process as long as you recognize what they share in common a risk-free rate and either one beta multiple bait is all trying to measure risk you cannot diversify away yes but there's no rule here you're still measuring return that's a judgment you have to make as an investor right if you want to maximize return you have to tell me how much risk you're willing to take right you can't just you can't have an objective function with no no constraint so if that's your rule then what are you going to do you're going to go fine at least in the cap m word you know what you need to do right to maximize returns because if you think about maximize returns let me go buy the riskiest stocks in the market in the cap and well that's not what you'll do because it you give up too much so in the cap M world how do you maximize Returns what would you do no don't plot to forget about the graph tell me in Practical terms what you do and doesn't answer my question right what is your sweet spot we're still talking around there's only one thing to hold what is it what do we all hold the market portfolio there is only one sweet spot so you have to find a way to be more exposed than she is get a higher return and if you're both holding the same thing what's the only way for you to get a higher return in the cap emblem you got to borrow money you borrow money you buy the same index your expected return will be much higher because you have less Equity at play right so when stocks go up 10 percent and you pay four percent interest you're going to make 35 percent you think this is great I'm going to borrow and keep borrowing there's a downside which is stocks don't just go up they sometimes go down it's a double-edged sword so in the cap M world if you want to maximize returns I'll give you a pathway borrow money buy on margin and buy that supremely Diversified Index Fund so the choice of maximizing returns kind of is up to you you have to decide how risk-averse you are how much risk you're willing to take and then you maximize returns subject to how much risk that's why you need that second part because if you just say if you walk into my office I'm a wealth manager I want to maximize your touch and I don't ask you any other questions and I take all your money and by Deep part of the money options with it I have maximize your expected return with one potential small downside which is you could lose it all in the next two weeks you come back and say what the hell did you do you told me to maximize returns never ask somebody to maximize returns without putting a subject to I don't can't afford to lose more than 50 percent of this or twenty percent the minute you add that constraint you maximize expected returns given that constraint get a question do you have your hand up somebody here no okay so that's all I'm going to say about risk and return models because we have practical things to do we have to Value companies we can't be spending the next 10 weeks talking about risk and return models so let's boil it down to Basics no matter which of these models you look at they're three ingredients you need to put them into practice you need a risk rate without a risky rate everything else becomes smooth if you don't know what you can make on a guaranteed investment you can't even build off that base so we're gonna there's a risk reader you need a price of risk in the equity Market we're going to call it an equity risk premium if it's a cap M you need one Equity risk premium if you have the Arbitrage pricing model a multi-factor model Phi betas you need five risk premiums so you need a risk free rate and risk premium and so far your company hasn't even entered the mix right those are external numbers risk created risk prints the third input I need is how risky is your company relative to other companies so that's the only input in this model that's company specific I often get emails from people saying I'm adding a chemical company what Equity risk premium should I use for a chemical company Equity risk premiums are market-wide the beta that you use is what's going to capture the risky company to save company part of the trick in valuation is to keep things in the place they're meant to go because you let them slip into other inputs you're going to be double counting triple counting quadruple counting risk so which of those three inputs do you think should be the easiest to get risk-free rates relative risk Clash beta or Equity let's start the easy what do you think which of the three do you think risk free rate right when I did my MBA which was a lifetime ago you know how much time you spend on the risk period I think two minutes I was told the U.S treasury rate is a risky rate and we moved on shows you how tall is Centric my MBA program was and how little time we spent thinking about your scripts it's not that easy so to understand risky rates I'm going to set the table for something to be risk-free you need to know exactly what you're going to make guaranteed everybody agree with that definition so think of what has to be true for something to be risk-free first The Entity issuing whatever you invested in can have no default risk not even an Iota because the minute there's default risk your return is not guaranteed right second and this might sound mysterious there can be no reinvestment risk let me explain let's suppose you're trying to come up with a risk-free rate for a 10-year cash flow can I use a three-month Table Right For That I know exactly what I'll make over the next three months assuming the US Treasury doesn't default but at the end of three months I have to find a new table and a new one and I don't know what the rates will be which means a three-month table is not risk-free with a tenure cash flow at 10-year t-bond is not risk-free if you're looking at a one-year cash flow you know if you bought a t-bond a year ago you thought you were buying a guaranteed return t-bonds are down 18 the return was about eight minus 18 why because rates change when rates change the price of the bond changes so here's what I draw from this first when you ask me what a risk-free rate is your question is incomplete I have to ask you over what time arise right I wouldn't know whether you want to risk free rate for the next three months I'm going to give you a very different answer than if your risk free rate for the next 10 years second you got to tell me what currency you're asking in maybe you are thinking in Turkish lira I can't be giving you a risk free rate in US dollars if you want to so risk-free rates have to have a currency component yeah and third remember that no default risk that you need I was taught that government bonds are risk-free in the local currency it is a very simple Logic for that right why should a government issuing a bond in the local currency what's the rationale for why they should never defer what should they be able to do more money right so historically in classrooms around the world and in investment Banks and offices around the world if you ask what's a risk rate in rupees we take the Indian government bond rate implicit there is comments don't default in the local currency the only problem is it runs head first into a reality which is not only do governments default in local currencies they do it an awful lot of the time half of all Sovereign defaults in the last 50 years have come from governments defaulting on the local currency why would they just not print the money so help me out here why think like a government right there's a big debt payment coming due you can always print the money and make the payment why might you choose to default rather than printing the money what happens if you print the money yeah it's not good yeah I doubled the amount of currency I did base my currency devalue is just two kind of word I debase my currency and I'm going to make a statement I'll try to back it up easy Latin America has been the epicenter of both default and inflation for the last what 200 years it's almost like they're perfected with an art form and I've been I used to go to Brazil almost every year between 1997 until covet had and my first visit was in 1997. this is five years after Brazil had gone through hyperinflation 5 500 percent six thousand percent I did a two-day evaluation seminar and every question I was asked over the two days was about inflation nobody want to talk about companies business models people had been so burnt by inflation that not only they worry about inflation but no Brazilian entity was able to issue long-term Bonds denominated in reality do you see why after you've had five thousand five hundred percent inflation if I try I'm ensuing a 10-year bond is that right I'm by I'm not buying that Bond the Brazilian government could not issue 10-year Bonds in realize it took until 2006 14 years after hyperinflation before the Brazilian government is able to issue Bonds in reality it took a long time to come back from the basement in contrast think about Argentina now I was in Uruguay like 10 years ago doing a seminar and somebody in the audience said what do we do about Argentina and for those of you not familiar with Uruguay is this tiny country with three million people right next door to Argentina and I said think of Argentina as this alcoholic crazed Uncle who lives in the Attic of your house who comes on every two or three hours say something weird and then goes back up you can't no he lives in your house you can't ignore it but my point is in any just World nobody should ever lend to Argentina ever again right just in the last 20 years how many times has Argentina defaulted but it's the amazing thing two years after default they're back again I remember in 2016 not the big seminar in Buenos Aires Argentina is back again portfolio managed from around the world it's almost like that Collective Amnesia about the last time they did this countries have learned that it's easier to come back from default than from debasement so you know what just because you have a government bond rate doesn't mean you've got a risk credit which means your job got a little more difficult right in some currencies you have some cleaning up to do to get to risk reading so here's how I'm going to approach the risk created discussion I'm going to hit you with a series of questions and along the way we're going to pretty much deal with every conceivable challenge through screen rates that you can think of so let's say you're buying a company in US Dollars you want a US dollar risk free rate and let's for the moment look at U.S treasuries I'm going to give you a series of rates and I want you to tell me which one you will use as a risk-free rate for evaluation something very explicit because an evaluation your estimated cash flows next year two years are three years are four years in fact you're estimating cash flows forever right so I want you to keep that in the back of your of your mind and tell me which of these rates you would use as a risk credit a three-month table rate you know the third of all DCFS I see use the three three month table right tell me what's wrong with that what what am I doing wrong yep it's a duration mismatch right first rule if you have cash flows that go 30 40 50 years don't use something that's a three-month rate I've never understood people who hold on to three month rates at risk three rates but there are textbooks I actually say use the table right it's the safest of the treasury rates not true so let's go long term you have the 10-year t-bond you got the third year T Bond if you just were a purist picking risk credits which of those is a better better choice for valuation good right you're doing the valuation so you tell me how long your cash flows lasted what happens after the end of 10 years when you're buying a company and what does the terminal value capture cash flows forever right don't let the period that you estimate the cash flows drive your risk rate this is nothing to do with it right so just because you stop in five years doesn't mean you stopped estimated cash flows just assume that Beyond year five cash flows will continue to grow at three percent a year forever there are no Perpetual U.S treasuries the British and the Canadian governments used to have Perpetual bonds called console bonds there are no U.S consults so if I had to pick a pure risk-free rate I would probably go with the 30-year rate longer term but you're going to see me use the 10-year rate as my risk-free rate in U.S dollars and I'll tell you why it's a pragmatic Choice the risk free rate is just to start my estimation problem right after estimate risk premiums for instance for cost of debt I have to come up with default spreads you know how I come up with default spreads I find corporate bonds with the same maturity and compare them to the USD Bond you see why I don't want to go with the 30-year t-bond because if I find make that my base I have to find 30 year corporates it's really difficult to find 30-year corporates so I'm going to go with the 10-year t-bond even though I know I'm probably undershooting partly because it makes the rest of my estimation easier and partly because the 10-year t-bond is you know it's a one Bond you see report in the Wall Street Journal in the top the reason it gets reported is every Monday it's in every auction third year bonds are infrequent they're much in a much smaller quantity so I'm going to go with the 10-year bond with no apologies it's you know it's a 10-year rate I know it stops after year 10. and in most other currencies you don't even have a choice 10 years about as good as you can get question I'm sorry Disney I understand you about but none of those are risk-free petrobras definitely is not risk-free and even Disney is not just free companies have issued 100 Year bonds and governments have Brazilian and Canadian governments used to have console bonds the U.S treasury has never gone beyond 30 years right there's no reason why they cannot in fact you could argue that maybe when rates were low they should have just gone and locked it in Forever that moment has passed yeah you could you could that's a good question I said your one year risk free rate can be different from your two year risky right so you could actually technically estimate a use the one-year treasury for the one-year risk-free the two-year treasury for the two year is free the only question is how much difference will it make and here's why I'm not going to bother what's your biggest cash flow in your valuation it's not going to be your one it's not going to be year two it's going to be a terminal value right so if it made a significant enough difference in valuation that's worth considering and I'll tell you what it makes a significant difference when you've got a steep yield curve in either direction you might say you know what I don't want to use the 10-year rate it's way below my one year rate I'm going to use the one year rate for my one-year cash flow so if it's going to make a difference and you could tell mathematically if it is then it's completely okay in fact it's probably the purest way of doing risk-free rates is take each cash flow and have a risk free rate that matches that cash flow and if you go to check a Bloomberg terminal you can get a yield curve of zero coupons that goes from one year to third year so getting the information is easy it'll make your present value a little tedious you can't use the PV function in Excel but that no that horse you know bolted whatever you know what I'm talking about so once you started to think about discount rates varying across time you couldn't use a PV function so that's perfectly okay you can have a risk-free rate that varies for each cash flow now what about a tip straight why can't I use it as my risk free rate if I'm using doing a DUI you heard what tip straight is it tips rate is an inflation protected treasury bond it's about a one and a half percent right now and here's how it works you buy a tips Bond you get one and a half percent plus whatever the inflation rate is that year so next year inflation is two percent you get one and a half plus two percent you get three and a half percent if inflation is eight percent you get one and a half plus eight percent nine and a half percent so what does that make the one and a half percent remember I talked about real valuations in real valuations if I were doing a valuation of a company in real terms the one and a half percent would mean by risk credit but the minute I decide to go down the dollar route I've chosen a nominal cash flow the tips rate is no longer the right risk free rate because I'm doing my analysis nominal terms so we'll come back to the tips right in the context of real valuation but doesn't fit what about enf I've seen people do this I'll pick the highest of the numbers why I want to be conservative what's wrong with you this is a risk-free rate you want to pick a number because it's high why don't you just make up a number 100 risk credit that would be really conservative as dumb as it gets and I no I'm not holding back on it so don't use the highest of the numbers or the lowest of the numbers it makes you've lost entirely all the consistency of water is created now in doing all of this though I'm making an implicit assumption that could come back to bite me right which is about the U.S treasury what am I assuming implicitly about the U.S treasury when I'm using any of these rates as a risk rating it will not default right 10 years maybe 15 years ago there was no question about that but in 2012 there was actually an incident during the summer of 2012 where s p lowered the rating for the U.S historically the US has always been Triple A from Triple A to double a now people you know Moody's did not lower it there was a lot of debate but the Pandora's Box has been opened right it is now open for debate we're coming up to another debt ceiling let's talk of what if you know Congress doesn't get through it I think it's legitimate to ask the question is the U.S treasury default free for the moment I'm leaving it as default free but I'm going to leave that door open just in case I changed my mind let's move on to a different currency so right now I'm going to use the 10-year T bond rate what is it at I think it's like 3.51 3.53 something like that so that's going to be my risk create for the moment it could very quickly change in two weeks or four weeks but that's going to be my risk creator anybody valuing a European company in Italian Spanish anybody we value Siemens the German company who are you ready where is it UK UK we've got to keep separate because I want to keep it to the euro zone for the moment the UK we have a different issue of what no what the risk credit is so you have Siemens you're going to do evaluation in Euros okay so you want a Euro risk rate right so I could give you Government Bond rate in yours in fact I could give you a dozen European governments all of which have 10-year bond rates here's where they are which of these rates would use as a risk created y they're different right you got to pick which one would use and why nope not the answer because then you're saying if you did a Spanish company you'd be using the Spanish government bond rate right and God help you if you're doing a Greek company you'd be using a Greek Government Bond rate can you imagine saying Greek government bond rate risk-free I mean do those words even kind of go together I mean step back why are these they're all in Euros right this is not 1997 we are drachmas and Lira and and and Deutsche marks these are all Euro bonds they're all 10-year bonds what's the reason for differences across the rates forget about the radic right why do markets why do why didn't markets do the Greek rates higher than even if a ratings did not exist you'd still have these differences in rates you're giving me the symptom not the Cause right why are you paying less for the Greek 10-year Government Bond in Euros then the German tenure born in euros thank you let's make it more specific as a bond order what's the only component of risk you care about default right the rates are different because there's more default risk in some of the EU countries than there is in others which already that means if you're talking about something risk-free a Greek Government Bond can never enter the conversation a Spanish in fact any bond here other than the German Euro Bond you've already lost the script right because you're using a rate that has some default risk in it and you're calling it risk-free so you know what you're going to use the German Euro bond for your company not just because it's a German company but because it is the risk-free rate in yours in fact 10 years from now the Portuguese 10-year Europe Miracles can happen what's the lowest number here you know what you should use right you should use the Portuguese this is nothing to do with this being Germany for the moment it's Germany but it could be whatever country has the lowest rate and even though you're saying please God let there not be enough defaults in fact there are some people argue you should use the ECB the European Central Bank Bond it's almost exactly the German Euro boundary but you're looking for something to fall free and here you found a country which is AAA rated and you're latching on to that trade so for those of you doing any company in Euros your risk-free rate is going to be the German Euro bond rate even if it's an Italian I know you want to punish this company for being Greek I'll give you plenty of chances to do that just don't do it in the risk period right go ahead currency of real material people risk yeah now that's going to be my next one so let's suppose you're looking at India right there's no AAA entity issuing Indian rupee bonds the Indian government has a 10-year bond that's trading at about 7.34 on January 1st 2023. most Indian analysts use the 7.34 as a risk-free rate in rupees has one stop they forgot to make before they got to their destination right which is is any of this due to perceived default risk in India so I cheated to answer that question I went to Moody's I know ratings agencies are not the sharpest knives in the drawer they come to the conclusions too late but it's three and it's accessible and they've Sovereign ratings for every country they have a local currency rating and a foreign currency rating for every country what's a foreign currency rating when India borrows money in Yen or Euros or dollars a foreign currency rating is supposed to apply the local currency rating is the risk that Moody sees in India when it raises money in rupees like in this government point you know what I was hoping and praying I would say what would make my life easy a triple A local currency rating in which case I'd abuse is 7.34 is my risk credit and blame Moody's if something went wrong they gave me a b double a three rating just to give you some perspective India's rating has changed fairly dramatically towards a positive side over the last 20 years they've moved in the right direction but b double a three still meets this default risk which means that 7.34 percent has some default risk in it and I'd like to take it out right if I could tell you how much of that 7.34 is due to default risk simple algebra you take it our deliveries created I'll take you to the process of estimating that default spread but in this case in early 2023 the default spread I estimated for a b double a three rated Sovereign was 2.69 percent so I'm going to set up an algebra problem for you the Indian government bond rate and Rupees is 7.43 percent sorry 7.34 you're trying to Value company in Indian rupees you can take the conventional drug to think it's a Government Bond I'm done 7.34 percent of zero is created I'm going to argue that you're setting yourself up to double count country risk if you do that and you're going to see what I mean by that the second is you could take the 7.34 and add 2.69 percent is that the right way to go am I going the right direction the wrong direction I'm actually double counting default spread right so the right thing to do is take the 2.69 percent out which means my risk-free rate and Rupees is 4.65 percent you know how many people who saw my adarn evaluation last week wrote me back you got the risk-free rate wrong it's 7.4 percent I said no no that's you know your definition of risk created and mine are varying because that 7.4 percent is a government bond rate that's not what I use as my risk credit and I'm going to talk about where the double counting comes in if you don't do this but if you have a currency where there is no default free entity you need to clean up the government boundary which means this number gets critical right the 2.69 how do I get that so I'll give you three Pathways you can use the first is if your country the country you're looking at has issued Bonds in a currency where there's something risk-free I'll give you and I'll make this specific most of the Latin American countries issue 10-year bonds not only in the local currency but also in US Dollars Brazil issues 10 year dollar bonds Peru issues ten year dollar bonds so you can look up the rate on that Bond so for if you look at Brazil you'll see the 10-year bond is 5.83 or 6.5 percent you compare it to the USD bond that difference is a bond market judgment and what the default spread is until 30 years ago that was the only place you could go to get default spreads the only problem that approaches it works for about 20 countries because most countries India for instance does not issue 10-year Bonds in another currency it works really well in Latin America it works relatively well in Eastern Europe like Bulgaria issues Euro denominated bonds so you can get the default spread but about 20 years ago there was a market called The Sovereign CDs Market that was started not a sovereign Syria spread the market allows you to do it allows you to buy insurance against government defaults if you bought a Brazilian bond in dollars and you said I'm worried about default you can go to the CDs market and Buy protection and the way you buy protection is let's say the Brazilian government bond is a rate of seven percent into dollar terms that's much better than the three and a half percent right but there's default risk you can go to The Sovereign CDs Market and you can buy insurance and the insurance is quoted on a yearly basis right now that spread is about three and a half percent the Brazil's Sovereign CDs so what does it allow you to do you buy the Brazilian Bond you collect the seven percent but the insurance guy shows up and says I want my three and a half percent so it becomes a market set estimate of the default spread it's available for about 80 countries now and the number keeps growing but it's a market-based number so if your country has a bond in another currency like the dollar or the Euro where you can get the risk-free rate yeah you have a way if your country has a sovereign CDs spread that covers about 80 countries now say what if my country has neither and there are about 80 countries which have neither Sovereign CDs spread nor do they have a bond in a different currency but many of them have ratings promotes yeah b double a b a b c Triple C whatever so starting about 20 years ago I started creating a lookup table based on rated countries which had Sovereign CDs spreads but if you tell me what the spread is I can estimate what are your rating is I'll tell you what the spread is so I'm going to take Brazil through all three approaches so you can see how this would play out in Practical terms so let's say start at 2023 you're trying to estimate a default spread for Brazil why because you want to get a risk-free rate in re-ice here's the first these are dollar denominated bonds there's a Brazilian 10-year dollar denominator Bond six point one five percent you cannot compare Bond rates in different currencies that's apples and oranges but I can compare dollar denominated Bond issued by Brazil to a dollar denominated Bond issued by the US the difference is my estimate of the default spread from the bond market it's 2.27 percent piled it away that's my first shot at getting the default spread do I trust it Bonza you know or depends on the trading of the bond how rich you know who's buying the bond so I went to The Sovereign CDs market and Brazil has a sovereign CDs spread that's traded and according to the Sovereign CDs Market that spread is 3.52 much higher than what you're seeing in the bond market The Sovereign CDs Market has an upside because it's a market that it's in real time it can reflect what's happening in real time the minute Russia invaded Ukraine The Sovereign CDs spreads for Russian Ukraine shot up the ratings agencies might not change it for six months or nine months or ten twelve months the bonds often stop Trading but the Sovereign CDs Market keeps churning out numbers I mean it has all the downsides of markets people overreact they Bunch regions together because they don't know what's in Latin America so something happens in Brazil they knock down Peru because they're somewhere in there and you must be in trouble too so the markets do weird stuff 3.52 percent so that becomes your second estimate the default spread but there's one small glitch in The Sovereign CDs Market which makes it difficult to read that number as a measure of pure default risk and here's what it is The Sovereign CDs spreads for 80 countries including countries like Switzerland you know what there's not a single country which is a zero Sovereign CDs spread which makes no sense right I mean are you telling me there's no country in the are any of your language oh my God I wonder whether the Swiss government is going to pay its Bonds on time what's going on this is a market that's still information one of the problems it has had historically is a counterparty risk you know counterparty risk is when you buy insurance it's great you have insurance but your insurance is only as good as the insurer you bought the insurance from the insurer goes under there goes in shorts when Lehman went under in 2008 they were one of the biggest players in The Sovereign CDs Market they almost took the entire Market down with them because what's the point of insurance if the other guy never comes through so I'm going to do this very ad hoc adjustment I'm going to say look the 3.52 you're seeing for Brazil is not entirely for default risk there are these frictions in this market that makes it a less than Pure Insurance market and the way I'm going to measure that friction is going to be very parochial I'm going to use the U.S Sovereign CDs spread which is I think 27 or 32 basis points at the start of 2023. I could have used this lowest of the spread Switzerland for instance but since I've used the U.S Sovereign CDs spread for as long as I've been doing this I take it out of the Brazilian spread saying you know that's probably more the friction effect you if you find that too uncomfortable just stay with the 3.52 so the 3.2 percent becomes my cleaned up proxy of subtracting out the US Sovereign CDs spread from the Brazilian spread so I have two numbers now a 2.27 percent spread coming from the government bond market and a 3.2 to 3.5 percent spread coming from The Sovereign CDs Market let me take a third shot and in Brazil I can try all three Brazil has a rating of ba2 Brazil unlike India has gone in the wrong direction it actually started with a higher rating 10 years ago in the last 10 years the rating is kind of slid because of you know first the petrobras the car wash Etc et cetera et cetera scandals and then you had you know there's been a series of things that I've kind of handicapped it ba2 ready remember what I said about lookup tables this is a table as I said I updated the startup library and this is my 2023 update a ba2 rated Sovereign Bond roughly speaking as a default spread of 3.68 percent I get that by averaging our countries with that spread with that rating and looking at Sovereign CDs spreads of bond spreads 3.68 this is troublesome right 2.27 percent 3.2 percent three point six eight percent you're saying which one should I use I'm going to say something incredibly odd but hang in there with me pick one stick with it because when you pick it you're going to say it's getting different answers in fact in the risk created the 10-year Government Bond rate in Brazil at the start of 2023 was 12.76 if I net out the spread from the Government Bond Market my risk free rate is 10.49 because I'm subtracting out a smaller number if I net out the spread from the rating the risk free rate is 9.08 and if you just stop there you're saying but I'm getting a much higher risk free rate using the first approach in the third approach so that must be bad right but this is only the first place you're going to run into this because later in this process I'm going to ask you to estimate a risk premium for Brazil and guess what we built our Equity risk premiums off we build it off default spreads so if you pick a really low default spread at this stage it'll give you a higher risk free rate but also give you a lower risk premium the one thing you cannot do is go back and forth now do you see what I meant about double counting if you leave the government bond rate if I said my risk free rate in realize is 12.76 percent and I start adjusting the risk premium for the fact that Brazil is riskier I am counting Brazil risk twice once in what I call my risk-free rate and once in what matters premium is so once you've picked a company if it's in a country where there is no default free entity you're lucky if you're in the dollars the Euros but even with no the UK no longer is Triple A rating the British government guilt rate the 10-year Guild trade is not the risk created in British pounds as a colonial power you're probably saying this is so demeaning but guess what things catch up with you so to adjust your risk free rate in pounds you got to take out the default spread in the UK it's not big same thing with Japan Japan doesn't hasn't added AAA rating in about 20 years now so if you have are in a country where there is this issue try all three approaches and see if it works for some of you all three will work some two out of three some you're stuck with just one and you're saying what if I'm valuing a Syrian company God help you but no we'll come back and talk about what to do about Syrian companies but maybe getting a risk-free rate might not be the biggest of your problems yeah any questions on the cleaning up so we'll come back and you know we'll revisit these spreads now let me go back to doing things in real terms I said one of the things you can do if you're really scared about inflation you want to deal with is do everything in real terms which means your cash flows have to be real and your risk-free rate has to be a real risk created remember once you do things in real terms currency disappears from the process there is no such thing as real dollars and real Yen and real Swiss Francs because real is real they've taken inflation out you might as well stop talking about currencies this is where the tips rate can help you but the problem is you're never doing real valuations in the US why because it's so much more convenient to do things in normal terms so rest of the word operates in a nominal basis right your taxes are based on nominal income you know where you're going to be doing real analyzes you're in Ghana you're in Zimbabwe you're saying look and I can't deal with the inflation here I'm going you're saying but I can't find something like the tips rate in Zimbabwe trust me don't even look you will not find it I'm going to give an easy way to get a risk-free rate no matter where you are in the world but then I'm going to add a caveat to it you know what your risk free rate should be if you're doing an analysis in real terms in Ghana 1.5 percent the tip tips right what about in Indonesia 1.5 percent and I'll tell you the rationale for doing it if you're talking about real risk-free rates in a world where Capital can move freely across borders there can be only one real risk read rate right because if I have a reorder is created a four person in one part of the world remember this is truly risk-free and truly real and one and a half percent in another part of the world what should happen money should leave the one and a half percent and go to the but the key the key point I made was if Capital can flow freely so when you use the tips rate as a risk free rate in Ghana you are ignoring the reality that Capital doesn't flow freely that the real risk created in Ghana could be higher you know but I can't think of an easy way to get a real risk free rate in occurrence my suggestion if you're really stuck and you're valuing a company in Ghana do it in South African rand currency is a choice you can value any company in any currency when it truly I mean I would never value Russian company in robots today just getting a risk credit would take me the next year right so I'm going to tell if you gave me gas prompt well I'll do it into all the terms in fact it's easier to Value gas problem in dollar terms because it's an organ gas company so it it sells into a global market that pays it in dollars or the equivalent of dollars so don't if you're having a really tough time even getting the risk-free rate nailed and that's a signal to you that maybe you need to switch currencies so now let me give you the big picture so you saw what I did with the Brazilian rii and the Indian rupee to get a risk created in the two currencies right at the start of every year Midway through each year I tried to get risk free rates in every currency where there is a 10-year Government Bond available let me so notice the add-on there not every government has tenure bonds outstanding so about 45 currencies we can get a 10-year bond a Government Bond then I did what I did with the rupee Andrea I cleaned up that Bond so what you see here the height of the column is the total government bond rate the red portion is the default spread I'm taking it out and what's left the blue is my risk credit so my risky rate in Zimbabwe and kwacha and I'll confess I've never valued a company in this currency is about 16 percent my risk-free rate in Turkish lira is Turkish lira let's be somewhere here no I'll find it one of these days no but as you can go down you got Colombian Peso Brazilian real Russian Ruble Kenyan Shilling so let me start with an obvious statement you look at that graph risk-free rates vary across currencies some currencies have high risk free rates some currencies have low risk relates and some can have negative risk credits so here's the question that's going to crack the currency code I know I've been promising this all the way through this class why do risk free rates vary across currencies and ask you why Government Bond rates vary because then you can do a song and dance about risky countries and safe countries assuming I've cleaned up for default risk why do risk-free rates vary across currencies yes it's got everything to do with inflation High inflation currencies will have high risk free rates low inflation currencies will have low risk credit and deflationary currencies could potentially have negative risk relates right and therein lies the answer to why currency doesn't matter in valuation if you pick a high current High inflation currency you're going to end up at high discount rate that's the bad news what's the good news when you value company that currency inflation is going to be like a win at your back you value a zombie and Company don't be surprised to see 20 growth even though it's a mature slow growing company because with 15 inflation you're going to get this high growth number your cash flows will have high growth your discount rate will be high high high cancel out if you take that same company and decide to Value euros it's true your discount rate will come down but when you estimate the growth rate for that company you can't use a 20 growth rate anymore because 15 of that came from inflation you might use a seven percent growth rate the key with currencies is to be consistent if you pick a low inflation currency via discount rate you have no choice but to estimate your cash flows in the same currency with the same inflation embedded because if you don't do that you've got an inflation mismatch so when you look at those risk free rates remember underlying it is a story about inflation and you've got to be thinking about that inflation when you think about doing evaluation now one of the mythologies about intrinsic valuation is if you do it it's Timeless but you can just sit on it for the rest of Eternity makes up this stuff I mean let's say you valued a company a year ago and let's assume nothing's changed the company it's got the same earnings the same cash flows the same growth rate you value the company today will your intrinsic value be different today than a year ago what's changed the word around your stage right risk-free rates have shut up risk premium so shut up you can't value a company in the world you wished you were in and you got to Value the company you're in so the risk of stating the obvious you're valuing a company today you're going to come up with the value your pro your buy or sell recommendation doesn't happen to win May 8th right you think what can happen between now and may don't tempt fate that's what people in my class in 2020 has what can happen in three months you know that's what happened in three months covet hit treasury rates collapse you went from 1.7 t-bond rates to point seven percent your table rates went to zero it is what it is complaining about it doesn't make it go away it is a fact of life rates can change and rates change your value changes and my advice to you is to have a separate input page where you keep things like t-bond rates you know what I mean by separate input page rather than entering hard code a number into an Excel spreadsheet of three point four seven percent have a separate input page where your spreadsheet copies from in fact if you want to be really clever you can tie that input page to Yahoo finance and it can up it's actually a neat looking device if nothing else you know because your rates can then update every moment of every day it might not change most of the time but periods like this one you can see how values can start to very quickly and it's not just a value that's changing right the price is changing as well you've got two numbers that are shifting and the question you're asking is is this company going from being overvalued to undervalued or vice versa I told you there are 45 currencies on which I was able to find a Government Bond which means there are about a hundred plus currencies where you don't even have a starting point see what do we do then seven years ago I was writing an Egyptian bank I don't know why I just wanted must have come up with something that I was asked that I was trying to do and I wanted to Value the com Bank in Egyptian pounds so I want an Egyptian pound risk credit I went looking for a 10-year Egyptian Government Bond denominate Egyptian pots there are not that's one of the 100 currencies but there's no tenure Bond so here's how I got a risk-free rate in Egyptian funds and this is a clever little trick you can use on any currency to get a risk credit what do we say causes risk free rates to be different across currencies differences in inflation right so here's what I did I started with the t-bond rate it's a dollar risk rate of two percent the inflation rate then the US Dollars one and a half percent the inflation rate in Egypt was about 15 percent you see where I'm going to go next right take the difference if you're in a hurry just take the 13 and a half percent difference add it to the t-bond rate you've got a risk-free rate in Egyptian pounds in fact the reason I do it a little Messier is because things compound inflation is on top of a real rate it gives you a slightly higher number but you can see that you can come pretty close just by adding the differential inflation so if you have a t-bond rate you can get differential inflation you think where the heck am I going to get the inflation in Egypt the U.S is easy right you just take the t-bond rate the tips ready to take the difference you got an expected inflation number it's about 2.7 percent now Egypt you can go to the the monitor the IMF for World Bank and I think the IMF makes a five-year forecast it's completely screwed up most of the time but you can get a number and blame the IMF if things go wrong but again I'm going to say something that's going to sound incredibly odd if you're going to screw up on the inflation rate if you screw up consistently it's not going to matter do you know what I mean by that let's say 15 is too low in inflation rate for Egypt what's the mistake I've made I've come up too low at risk you know too lower risk free rate in Egyptian pounds to lower discount rate right but then when I estimate the cash flows I use 15 that's too low in inflation rate it's great to have mistakes at average art and on macro variables this is what I'm looking for bail me out here so what I'm trying to say is if you're spending a week estimating inflation in some country don't do it for this class do it for some other class because in this class it's not worth the payoff make your best estimate use the IMF number move on but at least now you have a way of estimating risk-free rates in a currency where there is no Government Bond let's continue and complete the risk related discussion a year ago when I was teaching this class the t-bond rate started the year at 1.5 percent that was a low number how low depends on how old you were as a person I tell people look people talk about normal as if it's a number we all agree and one of the tests I would run when I when I did these sessions the last decade is I'd go in and people said that's a low rate it's much lower than the normal rate and I said what's the normal rate someone say six percent so you've been in the market way too long if you started markets in 1980s what do you think of as normal is framed by what your first few years brought you if you start in the 1990s four and a half percent looks like a normal rate if you started in this Century 2001 2002 maybe three three and a half percent if you started the last 10 years you think what's up normal about it that's what rates always are one and a half percent why do you think people are so shocked with three and a half percent rates is because both most of them started in markets in 2012 and 2013 they said oh my God this is unprecedented mortgage rates at six percent who's ever seen something like this when I took my first mortgage in the 80s it was 12 percent what I'm trying to say is this notion that someone normal is a fact is nonsensical because Normal based on what history you look at but in this case the tendency people have is to take a current rate because it looks too low and replace it with a normalized rate how about taking average over 30 years by looking at what they saw as rates you know 30 years ago to normalize risk free rates let's say I've done this a year ago I replace the one and a half percent with let's say four maybe five percent as matters created tell me mechanically what's going to happen my risk free rate is higher my discount rate is higher my value is lower I'm probably going to find the stock to be overvalued and when you find a stock to be overvalued there's actually practical advice you give right go invest in the risk-free investment and wait and in this case when I've normalized the risk period what I'm asking you to do I'm saying don't buy the stock go buy the t-bond that delivers five percent one year ago where the heck are you going to find a t-bond that delivers five percent this is not something you mess with risk-free rates you can if you want to normalize margins normalize growth go ahead and do it but don't normalize risk three dates this is an actual opportunity cost you face right now so I don't care whether integrates are too lower rates are too high or what do you think the FED will do in valuation the safest place to be when you think about riskery rates whatever the current rate is you're not saying the market is right you're saying but that's what I will have to make if I don't buy this stock now let's answer the question why were rates so low in the last decade I know the FED is the the the the entity that supposedly is kept right slow but I'll tell you a story about how this can worm into your head and you know ruin your thinking about almost a decade ago I remember going with my wife and my that my son and daughter was at home they had no choice but to go along and I drag them no that's why they left for college soon after I guess and we went on a tour of the Federal Reserve you guys ever done this I don't know whether they stopped with cobit but you can actually go to the FED building downtown to Marine Street or somewhere in the downtown area and they take you on a tour the most exciting part is when they take you down to the mint and you can see all this cash don't get any ideas it's well protected no unless you're part of ocean 17 or 18 and this is The Big Heist you're going to pull off it I almost made myself persona non grata right at the start of the tour so this tour guide comes up obviously very enthusiastic about the Fed and I almost wanted to ask the question the question I was going to ask is can you take me to the interest rate room there must be a room in the Fed but Jerome Powell sits with all these levels you know what the t-bond rate is getting a little low let me move it up a little that's a vision you get listening to CNBC right that the FED must be setting all these rates nonsensical because it only rated sets the FED funds rate the next question I was going to ask her was can you take me to that window I'd like to borrow at the FED funds rate you can try but it's not going to work it's an overnight borrowing rate for banks it's not for you and I the FED doesn't set rates it sets a Fed funds rate so where does this illusion about the FED setting rate it's because you you know I don't know whether have I ever told you the story of chanticleer I'll tell you the story it's actually a fun story it's about a rooster who actually is viewed as the most important creature in a farmyard why because the rest of the farmyard animals think that the sun comes up because the rooster cross it's an amazing without the rooster there will be no sun until the rooster makes a fatal mistake forgets to set the alarm on her on her or his it has to be his his iPhone doesn't wake up and guess what the sun does anyway it comes up and the rest of the Barnyard says you had nothing to do with this this is purely coincidence you managed to Crow it exactly the same time and we thought your crowing made the sun come up he said what's this got to do with the Fed what do we say causes rates to be different inflation right the FED is if you think about interest rates in general it's an equation called the Fischer equation it's one of the first things you're taught in econ 101. picture equation says if you have a nominal interest rate there are two components to it there's an expected inflation and an expected real interest rate so here's what I did every year I got the inflation number that's a red part of the column I took the real GDP growth each year and I added the two numbers if inflation is three percent real GDP growth is two percent I added three plus two I'm going to call that my intrinsic risk free rate you might say that's a stupid thing to do hang in there with me I did that every year so the red inflation green GDP growth I graph it every year the black line is the actual t-bond right this is to move together I mean I could show you the statistics with the correlation but the two move incredibly well together and look at the last decade Get Low inflation you need low or anemic growth what's low plus low there's your answer why would rates low for the last decade it was primarily because inflation was low and real growth was anemic did the FED have a role absolutely at the margin I estimated the FED effect has to be about 0.25 percent over the entire decade it kept rates about a quarter percent lower than they could have been by doing all kinds of gymnastics with you know buying back bonds it's a it's a tougher sales pitch I mean I can show that people multiple graphs they walk away saying no you must be wrong the FED sets rates because how do you counter hours that you hear every Wall Street Journal article what will the FED do you know what what will it do to rates so you can make your own judgment actually last year I have the T build rate every day and I have the FED funds rate changing during the course of the year you make a decision as to whether fed funds rates drive people rates over the table rates right fed funds rate a sensible Central Bank will make it look like they're the ones setting grades because that's where your power comes from it's like The Wizard of Oz your Pursuit your power comes from the perception your power and God help you if people lose faith in that perception happened to Japanese Central Bank about 30 years ago for the last 30 years you know what the Japanese Central bank's effect on Market has been nothing once you lose that power you've lost every piece of control you have but I want you to factor in if you if you're asking what will happen to rates this year what are the two questions you need to answer them not what the FED will do but what will inflation do if inflation stays at five percent I don't care what gymnastics the FED does rates are going to stay high and what will real growth look like that's what's going to drive rates this year it's those fundamentals now let's wrap up the risk created discussion by talking about negative risk credits no currencies like the Japanese Yen Euro and Swiss franc but there is free rates turn negative as I said that makes people uncomfortable in fact the rationale that people did for not valued companies if I use a negative risk free rate I'm going to end up with a really low discount rate yes but complete the story you're going to end up with a really low discount rate but what are you discounting cash flows in the same economy right and if you have an economy with negative risk-free rates would does the economy look like foreign growing healthy economy there's something fundamentally blood in the economy right maybe negative growth going forward deflation and you should be building those into your cash flows as well if you use negative risk free rates you'll get low discount rates but negative risk-free rates also go with negative growth rates in perpetuity they go with really low growth rates during your growth period I mean I value dozens of European companies with negative risk credits none I mean I didn't get a bias up from the fact that risk relates were negative because I tried to make sure that whatever cost rates to be negative were also reflected in my expected cash flows so I'm going to stop that because risk creates I mean I know I started this by saying let's take the easiest of the inputs and if this is what the easiest of the inputs look like you're probably saying I hate to see what the more difficult inputs look like but I think this is the input on which is the most misconception right because people have all these preconceptions Central Bank set rates the you know rates don't change that much and I wanted to step back and kind of say you know what many of these preconceptions are no longer true we need to think about risk three rates from the ground up so I will see you on Monday that's a different decision that's a selling decision you're going to make based on values that will price that right it's got nothing to do with the decision you make for today 
but okay just um so what do you guys think about that folding call in the last two minutes you're an Eagles fan you're pretty pissed off right look kind of you have no idea what I'm talking about it's just like a car but if you're an Eagles fan that was the moment that essentially ended the game for you because now while people are still coming in I just remind her you know if you don't have a group find one if you haven't picked a company pick one so times are moving we're into week three of the class um so once you pick the company if you can put it down in that Master list it's not fixed and you know it's not etched in stone if you want to change it you're welcome to but this is just to make sure you can get started because if you don't pick you cannot get started you cannot get started it won't stick nothing nothing in this class would stick unless you actually do it you know it's one of the natures of a craft right you can watch me whip make souffle I'm not good at making souffle but you if you did now you still need to make your own souffle before you can you know before you figure out what needs to be done so today's class is to be about Equity risk premiums and I'll set the stage the Ecuador screen was the price of risk in the equity Market it's what you're charging over and above the risk-free asset to buy equities as a class let me repeat that this has nothing to do with your company so you can't ask what's the equity experiment for Coca-Cola it's really an equity risk premium reflects the price of risk in the market it's a market set number and I'll today I'm going to talk about how most people estimated and why I don't like the way they do it but to set the stage for that discussion I'm going to come to you with a few very simple choices okay so you're going to be my guinea pig let's assume I come to you with an investment where I guarantee you a dollar every year in perpetuity guaranteed how much would you pay for that investment give me a number five bucks I'm probably not going to sell you the investment it's a guaranteed investment if you paid five bucks what are you earning as a rate of return guaranteed you pay five dollars you get one dollar every year you're going to make a twenty percent return I'd love to get it for five but my guess is if I open this up to a bidding war it's going to go to eight to ten and I can pretty much tell you where it's going to end right what's the price I'm probably going to end up with if it's a us it's a US dollar guaranteed investment roughly speaking where am I going to end up at but 30 which would be the inverse of the T bond rate right because you're going to end up properly there because that's what you can make on a guaranteed long-term investment so that's the starting point now I'm going to come to you you said 30 for that guaranteed investment let's assume it's a dollar a year still but it's not guaranteed it's an expected cash flow from equities collectively it's a 10. glad you picked that so that's a 10 expected return have you told me what your Equity risk premium is when you did that absolutely right 10 minus the three point three percent or whatever you had that's your Equity risk premium if I ask you what's your Equity risk premium you can make up numbers here's the problem with asking people what would you like to make I'd like to make 15 premiums but if you price stocks to make four percent premiums guess what ends up dominating it's what you pay that matters not what you say sounds mysterious but I'm going to argue that the best way to get Equity risk premiums is not look at the past not look at what people tell you they want but actually look at what they pay because as you have lower premiums you're going to pay higher prices and you get scared you're going to lower the price in fact let's take that let's assume that we build on that premise that this price tells you what your risk premiums there are studies that show that as people get older they get more risk of us because one of the reasons you pick 10 is implicitly your risk averse if we weren't risk of us you know what I would pay for that one dollar uncertain cash flow exactly what I paid for a risk free investment the essence of risk aversion is expected cash flow is expected cash flow we don't adjust for risk as human beings I don't think any of us have reached that stage of Enlightenment or stupidity depending on which way you look at it that's why we charge a premium because we're discovered and the more risk of us you are the larger the premium going to charge so studies show consistently that as people get older they get more risk averse lots of different reasons right one is you know what can go wrong and that kind of scars you second is your responsibilities your family so basically as you get older you get more risk of Rush now I'm going to build on this premise if you look at an equity Market it's composed of investors and the demographics of those investors can change over time in fact if you look at Japan you look at parts of Europe even China right now you have a demographic problem coming into play which is the populations are getting older for lots of different reasons so I wanted to take that to the next step if investors are getting older what should happen to equity risk premiums in that market they should grow which means stock prices holding all it's constant will be under downward pressure doesn't mean they'll go down tomorrow or day after but in markets with aging investor basis you're going to see higher risk premiums than you did before even if nothing else changes so your Equity risk cream isn't going to be a function of how risk-averse you are and that risk aversion can be affected by the demographics the market it can even be affected by vets let's assume I told you that there's been a crisis I take the example that I gave you the crisis can be a market crisis a 30 meltdown an economic crisis a political crisis you're willing to pay me ten dollars for that one dollar investment would you pay less or more off you know once this word of Crisis hits you that's because you're scared right that's what we do that's the only thing we have in our hands so when you get scared what do you do you push down prices why do you do that because you want to earn a higher return why not because you're greedy but because you're scared so let me make a statement about Equity risk premiums and let's see if we can come up with a way of measuring risk creams that reflects it Equity risk premiums in real life are unstable and unpredictable they will change over time which means any approach to estimating Equity risk premiums you have has to be dynamic you can't have an equity risk cream that says five percent five percent all through a year when crazy things remember 2020 when the whole world shut down you definitely don't want an equity risk premium measure that stays fixed over time it has to reflect the word you live in so for the moment that sounds mysterious because but as we go through the different approaches to estimating equilateral screens I wanted to judge that approach based on is it dynamic as it capturing what's going on right now foreign so let's go back to I think we were in page 46. of our notes let's talk about the equity risk premium here's the way most appraisers most investment Banks most Consultants get an equity risk premium they look backwards at what the history of returns you have earned on stocks and something risk-free so let's take the U.S market I actually update historical risk premiums on my website even though I never used them I update them because I know other people for whatever reason are fixated on them I go all the way back to 1928. already you can see that I'm starting with a market a U.S market very different from today's market 1928 was the year before the Great Depression very different much narrower Market but if we want history you have no choice right you have to go back in time and I compute Equity risk premiums for the us from the historical data notice I said use the plural Equity because I can estimate very different premiums depending on the slice of History I look at I could go all the way back to 1928 I could go back 50 years I could go back 10 years I could go back five years and each choice is going to give me a different number so when people are you know tell you there's a historical Equity risk premium act like it's a fact stop because it's it's not a fact it's an estimation effect second it depends on what I Define as risk-free I could use tables which are short-term governments or t-bonds it's a long term I get different Equity risk premiums it even depends on how I compute my averages see what does that even mean if I take 94 years of History an arithmetic average I take 94 years I add them up divide by 94. that's an arithmetic average a compounded or a geometric average looks at what you started with and what you ended with and looks at what you made over time on a compounded average basis do you remember enough of your statistics if I gave you an arithmetic average and a geometric average on a number will the two ever be the same or what has to be true for the two to be the same you can have zero standard deviation in other words you make nine percent every year which which goes against everything we know about Equity if there's on there's a standard deviation of volatility in your returns your geometric average numbers are going to be lower but they're going to reflect the truth much better right if you're ever confused about arithmetical geometric averages let me give you a very simplistic example let's assume two years ago you invested in a stock at a hundred dollars last year it doubled so what was your percentage returned last year a hundred percent right this year it happened it's a percentage you've done this year minus 50 percent through the magic of averaging you know what your average return was over the two years right 100 minus 50 divided by 2 is 25 a year but what was your stock price at the start 100 you ended at a hundred you made no money but I'm saying don't trust your eyes you really made 25 a year arithmetic averages are extremely misleading with stocks because of the swings you get up and down so if you look at those choices you can see you get very different risk creams ranging from four percent to 13 depending on how you compute perhaps and we tend to forget statistics when we do these numbers remembering statistics you take a hundred numbers and you compute an average you're trained to put in Brackets below that average how uncertain you are right a standard error see these numbers in italics those are the standard errors in your historical risk premium estimates let me repeat that again those are the standard errors near so when I tell you the the equity risk screen for the last 94 years is 5.06 percent that looks incredibly precise right second decimal point and then I said oh by the way the standard error in that number is 2.15 you remember enough statistics to develop a ranger on that number with 95 confidence what do you do plus or minus two standard errors plus or minus two times two point one five percent means the true Equity risk premium in the US can be somewhere between one and nine percent as if that helps you in any way and if you go to 10-year averages you might as well have told me absolutely nothing it's all noise a historical risk premium over the last 10 15 20 years it's nice to know but it's so noisy that it's useless as a as a forward-looking number but let's say you're willing to overlook that are you making another assumption when you use historical risk premiums assuming that you can Overlook the statistics what else are you assuming when you use the historical risk premium as your proxy for forecasting future premiums in other words you're assuming the introversion which is a fancy way of saying things will revert back to the way they used to be so it's a period we're looking at 1928 through 2022 right so we think the world is going to go back to the way it was between the bulk of that period is in the 20th century when the U.S was essentially the center of the global economy the most mean rewarding stable economy of all time and where extrapolating and say the future will look like that in fact I'm going to dig a hole for historical risk creams and bury them deep even though everybody used them they're incredibly noisy numbers and the noise basically comes from the fact that you have a standard error it's estimated you need about 250 to 300 years of uninterrupted Market history in a market that doesn't change for historical risk premium to be usable good luck with that I mean I've seen people go back to 1871 with U.S stocks the only problems in 1871 the U.S was an Emerging Market coming out of the Civil War There Is No Escape Hatcher it's incredibly noisy and I think using U.S premiums puts you at risk because you're taking the most successful Equity Market of the 20th century right that's the US and then you're saying the future will look just like that for me that's assuming you can pick the most successful Market of The Next Century so this use of historical risk premiums for better or worse is getting us into troubles now clearly if I'm not going to use a historical premium I have to use something else I'll come back and give you my alternative but before I do that I want to make this problem even more obvious today at least in the US you have this choice of do I go back a hundred years 150 years or 75 years milk is a Vietnamese Dairy company a really good company we've never taken a look take a look at the company publicly traded sells its milk across the world and you want a Vietnamese Equity risk premium you decide to do the only thing you know what to do which is a computer historical risk premium I actually had a Vietnamese anus values company and he said he said can you take a look at my valuation my first DCF and he done it everything mechanically right but the way he got the equator screen for Vietnam was by looking at historical returns in Vietnam how many years of data do you think you're going to have if you take a market like Vietnam he had like 14 years remember this was a country without an equity Market until about 20 years ago in 14 years he'd come up with an equity restroom of seven percent that sounded on the face of it not bad right so I asked him could you do me a favor and compute the standard error in this number just use that standard error function in Excel on the 14 numbers he came back to me and said it was 9.35 percent I say okay think about what you've told me that the equity is from seven percent and this isn't even two standard deviations one standard error it could be minus two percent or sixteen percent forget about two standard errors but with most countries you don't even have the historical data you have in the US so this is a bit of a problem right because you got to Value Brazilian companies so I'm going to give you the opening that I'm going to stick with in thinking about countries I'm going to start with the U.S premium because at least here you have the luxury of History not because I'm being parochial but because I want to start with the base and then I'm going to say if I know what that base is and I can come to you as a country let's say Vietnam you can help me out here my U.S Equity risk premium is let's say five percent and I'm looking at Vietnam would you expect the equity risk from Vietnam to be higher than five percent or lower than five percent higher because it's a riskier market right that becomes then a question of how do we measure that extra premium it makes our problem more manageable because we're focusing on having a base and and adding on top so I'll take you through a pathway of three different ways in which you can get that additional premium for a Brazil or Vietnam in India and Indonesia the first is a very lazy way it draws on a number we've already used to get risk free rates remember to get a risk-free rate in Indian rupees what I did I started with the Government Bond right and I subtracted out the default spread for India and I told you then I was going to do this because I did not want to double count risk I'll explain how the double counting plays out most investment Banks the way they get Equity risk premiums for emerging markets they start with the U.S premium off in a made-up number a number from some service and then they add the default spread to that country to come up with the equity risk cream for the country so if you look at an exam the Brazil example that we worked through where we came up with three different premiums based on whether you looked at Sovereign CDs spread or the rating or the Government Bond let's say you take the 3.68 from the rating approach get an equity risk for Brazil I start with the U.S premium 5.94 I'll talk about where I get that base premium and I add on that extra default spread now do you see what the double County would kick in if I'd left the government bond rate as is intact with that default spread built in and I push up the equity risk premium for the same default spread I'm punishing this company twice so when I first started looking at Equity risk multiple countries this was the state of the art if you can call it that take the US premium add the default spread let's move on so countries with high default spreads will also have high Equity risk Breakers but it's a little I mean you're using a default spread on a Government Bond as your additional premium for an equity market right sounds like it's a mismatch so I'm going to give you a second approach this is an approach that Goldman I think developed don't let the name lead you to believe that somehow it's going to work better it was a Goldman approach and here's what they did they said let's not even look at the bond market let's focus on equities we've got the U.S Equity risk premium that goes with the U.S market let's say I want to get an equity risk premium for Brazil what if I look up the standard deviation in Brazilian equities which leaves you a practical question what what are we using let's use the bobespa terribly constructed index perhaps the worst constructed index I've ever seen because it's a trade weighted index you know trade wedding is the more stock is traded the larger the weight in the index has got nothing to do with market cap but it's constructed that's that when once an index gets constructed badly you can't deconstruct it right because you have a history that you can't run away from but it's still widely used as the index for Brazil what if I gave you two numbers one was a standard deviation in the book let's say it's 30 percent and the other was the standard deviation the S P 500 about 18 percent I looked at a two-year standard deviation you can pull it off Bloomberg so basically I look you remember the algebra problems we used to do in sixth to seventh grade the US has 18 standard deviation you are demanding of 5.94 equity risk premium Brazil has a 30 standard deviation what's the question I'm asking What premium would you demand I'm going to scale up the 5.94 for the basically I'm scaling up for relative Equity Market volatility I come up with 9.9 percent as my total Equity risk premium for Brazil and if you ask me to decompose it 3.96 the difference between that and my U.S premium is the additional premium I'm charging for Brazil so this looks pretty good right much better than using the Government Bond but it rests on Equity Market volatility so when when Goldman came up with this I said okay let me do this for every Market in the world it's not difficult to get volatilities and I discovered the Egyptian Market should have an equity restraint like one percent you know what because its standard deviation is like five or six percent what drives standard deviation the riskiness of the market but for it to show up in standard deviation the price has to change and for the price has to change what has to happen people have to trade illiquid markets Costa Rica is like four and a half percent standard deviation I still remember a Wall Street Journal article I read a long time ago about the Egyptian market and how trades were recorded you know how they were recorded there was a guy with a chalkboard I'm not kidding you who stood in front of the exchange and every time a trade happened he would write the trade in chalk on the board and he wouldn't fill up the board by the end of the day if you have in a liquid Market your standard deviation is going to converge in zero there are about 40 countries where if you use this approach all of Africa looks very safe to me that nobody trades and I I guess parts of Africa it shows up as Ivory Coast to buy those stocks I must be really safe this approach is fatal flaws you're comparing markets with different liquidity more liquid markets are going to look riskier than less liquid markets you bring in liquidity effect so about 20 plus years ago I decided to kind of split the difference I said look I cannot compare markets in the U.S and Brazil because of different liquidity but maybe I can compare markets within Brazil so I went to the first approach and I looked up the default spread remember 3.68 and I looked up two standard deviations just like the second approach but here are the standard deviations I looked up were the standard deviation the bovis for Brazilian equity and the standard deviation in the Brazilian government Bond like similar algebra pump but the Assumption I'm making is if one is a liquid the other is going to be a liquid as well and I looked at the ratio Brazilian equities are about one and a half times more volatile than Brazilian government bonds remember that default spread of 3.68 a charge for the bond I scaled it up to reflect the the fact that equities are one and a half times riskier I come up with five point five two percent the equity risk cream I call this my melded Approach because I'm stealing from both approaches to come up with a risk premium of 11.46 percent for Brazil very Professor um the slice is not being shown on Zoom for the folks online let's see thank you for letting me know okay now it should right you can see the slide now yeah yeah thank you so I have three different versions of the equilateral screen one coming from the default spread one coming from looking at relative Equity Market the third approach will they give you different numbers obviously you gotta hang your head on one or the other right so if you want to go the old-fashioned way add the default spreads I'm okay with that if that's what you do for every country if you want to go the relative Equity Market quality approach be very careful we're going to get some strange looking Equity risk premiums for parts of the world if you're okay with it you can go along I'm not okay with it but you know that's your choice the third approach is my preferred approach and it's in fact the approach I use at the start of every year to get Equity risk premiums for every Market in the world now some of you might have got the link that I said yesterday about my most recent data post on Country risk and essentially the point I was trying to make is you can't hide from country risk anymore when I first started teaching this class a big chunk of the class I was going to work in New York for New York and Western Banks looking at U.S companies this is 1986. and the reaction is why are we talking about country risk let's say some of you are planning to work in New York on just U.S companies you still have to think about country risk let's see looking at Coca-Cola you think you're immune from country risk because the Companies Incorporated in the US and it's headquarters in Atlanta it gets 40 of its revenues from Emerging Markets welcome to globalization you go to work from Mumbai you don't you work with an Indian company let's say you know bartiertel put significant investments in Africa everybody needs to have a template at least for thinking about country risk so this is pretty selfish so 25 years ago I said I need these numbers in a value company so I'm going to estimate Equity risk premiums by country so I'll take you through the start of 2023 so you can see exactly where the numbers come from I started the base premium for the US I'll come back and talk about where the 5.94 comes from it's not a historical premium it's an updated forward-looking premium I'll go through that process then I look up The Sovereign ratings for every country that I can find a rating for Moody's rated 151 countries last year so I have 151 countries for whichever date s p pretty much as the overlap for those countries if you have a triple A rating you made my life easy I'm going to give you the same premium that I estimated for the US I know it's lazy but here's the Assumption I'm making if you're AAA rated you're a mature market and mature markets need to share a premium you kind of 10 mature markets with different premiums because money is going to flow across so every country with a triple A rating will get a 5.94 premium if you're not AAA rated then I'm going to go find a default spread that goes with the rating for those countries where there's a sovereign CDs I can use that but if I don't have that I'm going to go with the rating base spread and then I'm going to multiply it and rather than using each country's Government Bond and Equity to get a ratio I use One Direction I'll tell you why there are only about 40 countries remember that at government bonds only about seven or eight of those are liquid so trying to get government bonds standard deviations in a country to Country basis I'm going to tear my hair out so here's how I cheated I looked up two standard deviations one is a standard deviate these are both s p indices of an Emerging Market Equity index the second is a standard deviation and an S P public Bond Emerging Market public Bond index so that ratio looks across emerging markets that ratio is 1.41 at the start of 2023. so here's how it will play out if your default spread is two percent I'm going to multiply the two percent by 1.41 that gives me 2.82 and then I'm going to add that on to the 5.94 percent Equity risk premium that I have for the US to come up with an equity risk premium for your country and I'm going to do this for every country for which I could get a rating yes and also removed the transaction that side remove the U.S portion of it I use the net spread so when you look at my Equity risk premium page that's a number that you'll see playing out it'll be 3.2 percent for Brazil once I net that out but that's basically what I would use exactly in fact that's my suggestion whatever you chose to do in the risk read stick with it here it's going to even out do you see what I mean by that use too big a spread there you can lower the risk free rate too much but you can increase the equity risk premium proportionately yes so what's different about the market volatility versus the emotion of the board I'm basically staying within a market with the Assumption being liquidity is more likely to be comparable if I'm looking at stocks and bonds within a market then if I compare across markets right so if I compare the Pakistani Equity Market to the Pakistan Government Bond they're both in liquid they're both the lab low standard deviations if you compare Pakistani equities to U.S equities I'm going to get very strange result because I'm comparing an illiquid Market to a liquid Market okay so here's what the world looked like to me at the start of 2023 so essentially I've broken down countries geographically and don't jump down my throat about putting your country in the wrong geography you know how many emails I get from people saying how dare you put us in Eastern Europe and Russia where West Europe especially hungarians polish this is all I spent my first two weeks on and so whatever it is move it if you want to move it go ahead and move it I really don't care this is really just so I can fit it all into one page but there are a couple of things to notice about this the 5.94 that you see showing up for the U.S Canada Germany Singapore Australia the Netherlands you know what they share in common right they're all AAA rated countries if you're not AAA rated the red number will tell you the additional risk premium the reflects the default spread times 1.41 so that's a total country risk premium you add the red number to the 5.94 you're going to come up with the equity risk premium by country should I take Latin America the safest country in Latin America this has been true for probably the last 20 years it's chilly it's riskier than it used to be but it still stays the safest country but Latin America is a mess I mean you can look at Venezuela 30.63 and even at 30.63 you're probably terrified this is a dollar Equity risk premium but you can see the differences across when I started doing this I did not expect a single person other than myself to be using these Equity risk premiums but this is now the most downloaded data set on my website by far it gets used in the strangest places I have absolutely no control in how it's used so I've kind of given up on it I remember for you know I can keep track of geographically where people are coming on to my website so I remember when one month I was checking and a lot of lithuanians were coming on I said what the heck is happening here how am I so popular in Lithuania it turned out that for a while Lithuanian the Lithuanian government when it was considering privatization proposals required people to use My Equity risk premium I didn't get any commissions from this and but I said okay good I'm I'm being used in Lithuania I remember getting an email from the New Zealand milk board no there's a milk or but no how do you do this risk premiums but here's my admission there's no intellectual Firepower Behind These numbers right it's not like I'm researching Venezuela deeply I'm starting with the fault spreads and building up that's its weakest link because of the default spreads are either wrong or don't reflect the equity risk appropriately in the country you're probably going to mistake the equity risk I'll give you an example take a look at Saudi Arabia why is the equator screen so low because there's very little default risk why is default is so low when you have cash coming out of or you know the oil and you don't have to borrow money nobody's worried about it but if you're investing in equities in Saudi Arabia I would argue that there are risks you worry about right political risk upheaval risk that's not in the default spread so I'm fully aware that by looking at default spread as my starting point I might be missing pieces of the puzzle but here's the one thing it is going for it I do exactly the same thing over and over again it's got that element of consistency at least there's no bias here I don't sit there saying I like Venezuela a lot you know maybe I should lower the risk premium no no I'd really let the numbers play through incidentally one recent add-on is if you look at the very top right hand corner of the page you'll notice that there are Equity risk premiums for about 15 countries and you can take it read down the list we can already see that these are not exactly the countries we are running in to invest in Syria now North Korea any of you lining up to go into North Korea and until about five years ago I didn't have a screaming to them because there was no raiding no default spread nothing so starting about five six maybe 2015 or 16. here's how I started estimating I could have screens for them the services that measure risk country risk scores they don't do it for default or they just come up with countries want to serve one of the services I use called political risk Services they come up with a numerical country risk score for countries the scores go from low to high lower very risky countries higher very safe countries Switzerland was the safest country in the world to invest in last year probably no surprise and Assyria might have been the most risky part of the world to invest so I look up these scores for these 15 countries for which there's no rating then I cheat here's what I do I go look for other countries with similar scores so if you have a score of 38 I look for other countries which goes between 35 and 40. and then maybe two of those countries have a rating in an equity risk premium guess what I do I average that I attach it to you and I move on simplistic guilty as charged but if you have a better way of estimating Equity risk Crimson North Korea I'd love to know what it is and if your business is heavily half in Syria half in North Korea North Korea God help you but at least I can give you an equity risk premium number I can't do much more than that but no matter where you operate in the world now at least I can say this is the premium you should be demanding for being in that part of the world so any questions on Country Equity Risk please because now I want to go from Equity risk rooms to countries to estimating them for companies yes I do it twice a year right and usually you don't have to do much more if you want to update them every month you actually have a basis at least the base premium for the US update every month so you can actually so if you go to the spreadsheet the starting number is the US premium and if you want to make it the rest of the premiums are a function of whether it's default spreads change and ratings ratings don't change very often maybe like you know you'd probably be underestimating the equity risk claim for Russia in 2021 if you use the start of the year because in my March or April the whole thing was coming apart but that's something that that you have to think about if you're investing in a country where something massive has happened go get the Sovereign CDs practice what I do is it's kind of replace my default spread with your Sovereign CDs spread so Sri Lanka for instance when it went to hell in a handbasket last year that's what I told people look I can't be updated and I'm not a dated service I can't be updating this once every month but the metrics I use are pretty straightforward so for most countries it won't change dramatically but for a year like last year with default spreads rows over the course of the year my mid-year Equity response for countries was vastly higher than the start of the year so let's talk about how this plays out in companies yes that's a that that is their U.S dollar premiums because the markets are US dollar markets right the CDs Market is a DOT which creates a currency and consistency right one way you can get around this is to get an equity risk premium in dollars then scale it up for inflation it's very simple basically because the only reason it should be different if you're doing things in rupees is this is on top of your risk rate so already your risk-free rate will be much higher if you have a high inflation currency and then you can scale up the premium even more to reflect the fact that you have 30 inflation to three percent it's as simple as multiplying your Equity risk remember 1.30 divided by 1.03 the differential inflation and you can adjust the premium for different inflations because risk Creator it takes care of itself because that's you know because I can value an Indian company in dollars I can value it in rupees so this is the way you preserve consistency otherwise you're going to be all over the place if you're using default spreads and risk premiums that are inconsistent across currencies so now let's talk about how this plays out with individual companies let's start with a lazy way of doing this which is what a lot of analysts seem to still follow you look at where a company is incorporated what country it's Incorporated give it the equity risk from that country so you know what's going to happen here right every Indian company will get the Indian Equity risk premium every U.S company will get the U.S Equity risk premium and to me this is a recipe for disaster why because you can have an Indian company that gets 90 of its revenues in the US and the U.S company that gets 90 of its revenues in Nigeria or you can take a South African company and South African companies actually did this re de-list in Johannesburg and relist in London and there were actually analysts who said oh your premium went down to the UK premium what did you do bring your gold mines with you from South Africa and stick them in the middle of Lancashire it's it makes absolutely no sense but it's amazing how much of traditional valuation still takes it where you incorporate it end the story let me add your risk brief it's almost nonsensical the second approach is to say look I put in all this work to get to a beta I'm not going to waste it I'm going to bring the equity risk premium into that beta calculation and this Equity risk premium can be either a local premium or a weighted average the way you operate and multiply by basically you're assuming that beta measures your exposure to all other risk just as much as to contrary risk as much as measures to all others and the third approach you treat country risk as a separate beast in itself you're saying there's a country risk premium but a company's exposure to that risk is going to be dependent on the company and we'll talk about some of the factors it makes some companies more exposed to Country risk than others but the central questionnaire is how the heck do you come up with that country risk premium as I said the lazy way you say tell me we're Incorporated I'll give you that risk premium but for the longest time I've been pushing this and I'm having some traction but not enough in my view that ultimately a company's exposure to Country risk comes from where it does business he's like what do you mean where it does business well where it makes it stuff where it sells its stuff where it's distribution centers are located seems like the common sense thing to do we can debate practically how to measure that but that is my starting point so let's take an example of how I would compute Equity risk premiums for multinational companies the first is uh from 2004 I was doing evaluation of embrar embryer is a Brazilian Aerospace company gets most of its revenues in fact in 2004 97 of its revenues in North America and Western Europe not even Asia just those two in fact if you compare how much of Empires revenues come from North America and Western Europe to Boeing's breakdown it's exactly the same but embryo happens to be a brazil-based company rather than use the Brazilian Equity I used to wait to the average of Brazil's risk premium which is huge three percent and the remaining 97 came from developed markets so I gave it a mature Market premium I was treating embryer as the equivalent pretty much of a U.S company now there is a problem with what I'm doing right where does Empire make its aircraft though in Brazil by focusing entirely on revenues you can say I'm missing that risk so I'll come back and talk about that this I'll talk about why I use revenues as my starting point it's not because I love revenues it's because desperation drives me that you know what I mean by desperation most companies in fact almost every company I look at will break revenues down geographically but try and you can check with your company very few companies break down the production geographically or any other metric geographically so sometimes use revenue is because you have no other choice but there is a danger of missing some risk if you take embed another brazil-based beverage company and this is in 2012 their revenues by 2012 were coming from all over Latin America to Brazilian company but guess what it's jumping out of the frying pan Into the Fire because it's going into riskier Latin American markets that's affecting its Equity risk and if you look at a company like Coca-Cola sorry you're really I mean all bets are up because it's a U.S Incorporated company but it gets its revenues from all over the world notice I've given up on countries here it's by region Coca-Cola actually doesn't break its revenues down by country and who can blame them it'll be like 72 countries in the list they break them down by regions and if you go back a couple of pages and look at the map that I showed you for the word notice that there's a regional average that I report for each part of the world the reason I report that is I need it for companies like Coca-Cola which break revenues down regionally you know how I get the regional average for Asia and Latin America I don't use a simple average why because I don't want to wait Myanmar as much as I weighed China in Asia clearly your company says we're in China they're not getting equal revenues so I waited based on GDP it's the simplest metric I could think of so Asia is going to be heavily weighted towards China and Japan and that makes sense because you're in Asia that's no more and increasingly India Latin America is going to be heavily weighted towards Brazil but those Regional averages are what I use when I when I compute the equity risk premium for Coca-Cola is how much you get per region now I'll caution you when you look up these numbers for your company you're going to get frustrated this companies are horrifically bad about how they break down their revenues your typical U.S company breaks its revenues down into 71 percent of our revenues come from the US 29 from the rest of the world come on guys the rest of the world is a really big place can we start to get a little more specific this is my prom with accounting disclosure they're asking companies to disclose all this crap I couldn't care less about could we start by having a way of describe now at least describing where your revenues come from that I can use in valuation European companies have a different problem they actually break their revenues down into Europe and other and what are the reasons they report is emea what what does he have oh it's a Middle East and Africa what the heck are you doing bundling them all into one place I'm not even sure they go together Beggars can't be choosers you're stuck with what you have don't try to fight the data saying I want more there isn't more no more you got to take what you can but the revenue Focus can be a little troubling now I understand it I wish I could do more and you could argue that maybe I need to bring in the other factors where are your factors the second should I be multiplying this by Beta or not in other words once I get this risk premium should I just added on as a constant should I scale it up are riskier companies and risky markets doubling up their risk because you're taking a risky market near a discretionary product so those are questions that can be examined I'm willing to open the debate in fact I think it's worth debating should we be looking at things other than revenues so let's take an example where revenues clearly should not be used 2015 I had to Value Royal tax I didn't have to I want I decide to Value Royal Dutch I think I know think of an oil company right extract oil where do your revenues come from they come from a global oil Market is settlement Market your risk as an oil company doesn't come from where you sell the oil it comes from where you extract the oil and guess what when God decided to put oil on the world he decided that either by giving oil you're going to make that part of the world really risky or you take the riskiest parts of the world and put it there you don't have any oil in Switzerland you have a lot of it in Nigeria and Kazakhstan and wherever else you got to go look for it and the nice thing about oil companies is they do tell you where they get their own this is from Royal Dutch's financial statement so I didn't need any private information sources right out of its annual report they tell you where the oil and gas is produced and I took a weighted average of the equity risk premiums or where they got their oil the equities ended up for Royal Dutch looked like that of an Emerging Market company Royal Dutch on the face of it looks like a UK or a Dutch company it's got this dual personality but in reality it's an Emerging Market company listed in London or in the Netherlands depending on where you look at it yes it wouldn't matter right because as remember the only risk we probably said is the risk you cannot diversify away so you diversifying does nothing for me as a modular investor who's Diversified risk in each one okay this is the McKinsey argument until the 1980s McKenzie used to argue that companies should not add premiums for being in Risky countries and they made exactly this argument it's a diversification argument if you're in a hundred countries things will average out the 1980s they were actually right the only promise that argument rests on the premise that con what happens in countries is uncorrelated right or likely correlated guess what globalization has screwed that up was for us too you look at 2020 the first quarter every Market in the world is down at the same time in Period to worry most about risks which is Crisis periods markets tend to move almost intent so practically I can see the argument but if you look at the numbers it just doesn't add up anymore so maybe in the 1980s you could get away as Coca-Cola did using 12 cost of capital everywhere in the world I hope they're not doing it anymore it just doesn't make sense okay so you can use Revenue weights you can use production can use a mix of the two what if you have an automobile company right the reason oil companies and natural resource companies are kind of locked into country risk is you have no choice right the country Goes to Hell in a hand basket there's nothing you can do but if you're a Manufacturing Company it's difficult but it's not impossible some if if any of you say look can I weight production 60 and revenue is 40 absolutely I think it's a choice you have to make and it's a healthy discussion to have where does the risk in my company come from so that's the second approach basically is you is you try to bring it all into a weighted average Equity risk premium there's a third approach where you focus very closely on Country risk and this is an approach I would use very rarely it's for a company where country risk is front and center like what like the Italian group let's face it whether you whatever you think about the identity group that died at the hip to the Indian story why they're an infrastructure company in a country where infrastructure is the key ingredient needed for the country to make it into the growth story it wants to be so you could argue that maybe I should be looking at all of the elements that look at it and here are some of the things look at one is no there's a comp does the company use any kind of risk management products to protect itself against country risk you can buy insurance against certain kinds of political risk it's very expensive but more critically is the company viewed as somehow as being in the National interest God help you if you're a company that's viewed in the National interest because your country risk exposure just went down because you know what that means right every time the country is in trouble it's going to drag the company down with it because you're a national interest company so what I'm opening up at least as a possibility for some companies you might worry so much about country it's such a big part of your story that you want a more refined measure of how exposed is my company to that country risk so a few years ago I'll tell you the history of this particular approach dealing with country risk I think 2003 I was flying to Brazil to do a valuation seminar and at that time I was doing what everybody did Brazilian company Brazilian country risk and the two companies I was looking at were embed which at that time was a hundred percent Brazilian company an Empire which at that time as you could see was about three percent in Brazil 97 elsewhere long flight I'm checking through my slides I get to the slide where I have cost of equity for both companies I'm giving them both Sky High Cost of equity because in 2003 Brazil was a very risky country they said this is not fair they're both Brazilian companies but to expect embryo to be less exposed to Brazilian country risk the number he said I've got to come up with a way to differentiate across companies so I concocted a measure called Lambda notice the word I use concocted not derived because that's just deep thought you're on a flight 30 000 feet up you can cut things your kind of mind is not quite there anyway I couldn't calculate a measure called Lambda lambdas just like bait it's scaled around one your Lambda one meter is exposed as the average company in the market to Country risk a Lambda above one means you're more exposed in the typical company Lambda less than one means you're less exposed you're saying why call it Lambda because attaching a Greek alphabet adds a layer of sophistication almost everything you do I could have called it l but you wouldn't have been as impressed right Lambda it's a land in Brazil I fell asleep right after I thought about that land in Brazil I throw this idea 300 Brazilian people now in Brazilians in the room I say what do you think of this idea that different and they all like the idea then one of the more pragmatic people in the audience is how do you propose to measure Lambda I said I haven't thought about that yet but I have a long flight back and I did have a long flight back and actually wrote an entire paper this is one of the great things about flights before you had why fired flights you have nothing to do other than eat drink and watch terrible movies so I said I better use so it's actually on my website I'll send you the link for it on estimating company risk exposure to countries I talk about what are the things I would love to know about a company things I would like to ask them and then I came up with different ways of estimating Lambda I'll start with the most simplistic you tell me what percentage of your revenues you get from the domestic Market the market I'm worried about if I know what the average company in that country is getting as revenues from that country I have a way of scaling your Revenue so as an example take two Indian companies start a Motors and Target Consulting Services both Indian companies both part of the same family group Tata Motors was getting 91 percent of its revenge in 2008 2009 from India Tata consulting service was getting about eight percent very simplistic here's what I did I divided each of those numbers but what the average Indian company was getting in India 80 percent what does that give me it gives me a Lambda 1.14 for automotive suggesting it's more risky than the average Indian company more exposed to Indian Country risk and 0.09 Consulting service simplistic whatever Lambda in fact in 2009 automotives did something that brought their Lambda down pretty significantly you know what it did it acquired Jaguar Lander over the minute they acquired Jaguar Land Rover you've essentially bought exposure in global markets it brings your Lambda down so it's simplistic but it gives you at least a starting point for lambdas but it's still based on revenues right so through the paper I wrestled with what can I use I tried earnings terrible right account and smooth things out it's very difficult to get a measure of so latch on to the approach that I think offers the most promise if you go want to go down this route and as I said I rarely go down this route a little later in this class I'm going to talk about pages you've seen betas in Prior classes how do we estimate the beta for a company what do we do we're on a regression of what against what Returns on the stock against Returns on an equity market index the slope of the line is debate why because it measures how much my stock is affected by movements in the overall Equity Market what's the question I'm asking with Lambda is how much is my company affected by changes in country risk right so I said if I can find something that moves just because of country risk and ironic regression of Returns on my stock against that maybe I can get a sense of what does the market think about my company's exposure country risk in 2004 here's what I used I use what was called the c bond which is a Brazilian dollar denominated Bond so it's a dollar denominated Bond so there's no currency effect so what's causing that bond to go up and down in value swings in the risk of Brazil it's all driven by default risk and I ran a regression of embryo versus the seabon and in brothel which was in a sense the most country-based company I could find in Brazil because it's a phone company in Brazil gets 100 of its revenues in Brazil remember if my company's very exposed to Country risk you should expect to see a high slope if it's unaffected you should see a slope of zero maybe it'll actually go in the opposite directions I've never seen that happen maybe that can happen too so think of it like a beta but I'm trying to measure exposure to just country risk let me cut to the chase when I ran the regression if I looked at him prior the slope I got was 0.27 for every one percent move in the c bond and Brian moved only 0.27 the market hit Embry but not very much in contrast if you look at the embroidery regression for every one percent move in the market and broader move two percent supremely exposed to Indian Country risk so if any of you are interested in saying hey is there a way I can test to see how much the adani group is exposed to Indian Country risk here's my suggestion India doesn't have dollar denominated Bots but it has Sovereign CDs spreads run it against the Sovereign CDs spread and if your thesis is right when the CDs spread moves up and down you see adani's returns reflected as well it's a lot whoever's got their mic open could you just mute yourself so when you try to estimate exposure continuous this is the most time consuming and you can see why I would never use it for a multinational that's in nine countries or 11 oh God help me Coca-Cola with 72 countries you know what I'd have to do right estimate lamb designates each of the countries and I'm no more stuff to do with my valuation this is not where I want to fight my fight so 95 of my companies I'm going to use the weighted Equity risk premium approach in spite of all of its limitations and move on but if you have a company that's singularly exposed to one country and you want to focus deeper on that connection think of the Lambda route even if you decide not to Route it at least get a sense of how dependent am I on Country risk when I value this company so will these different ways of thinking about risk yield very different numbers let's think about the broad choices you can go with Brazil as a Brazilian I mean embryo is a Brazilian company treated as a purely Brazilian company and if you do that you're going to end up with high cost of equity why because you're going to get the entire so when you see the 17.24 and 17.79 those are approaches where I punish him Brian for being a Brazilian company give it all of the risk of Brazil the other three approaches the only variants are am I multiplying by a beta a Lambda but they all give you roughly no similar numbers right nine to eleven percent but you get two Divergent set of numbers if you treat embryer as a Brazilian company you get much higher cost of equity if you treat embryo as a company based on where its operations are you get much lower cost of equity what does that mean for valuation if I treat it as a Brazilian company and give it the entire Brazilian country risk I'm going to have higher discount rates and a lower value if I treat it as a company based on where it does business I'm going to use low so don't let the differences within each approach kind of drive you it's really about hey which way do I want to think about cost of equity and you're going to get very different valuations now I made the argument that operations based Equity risk premiums make more sense right so if you believe me then I'm saying 9 to 11 makes a lot more sense than 17 to 18 but let's say the rest of the world doesn't agree with me and perhaps with you everybody else is using 18 as the discontract to Value companies it's not right but they're the ones pricing stocks so here's my question if you believe that they're wrong in doing that and you decide to invest based on that you're going to be buying a lot of embroidery and a lot of Infosys and a lot of winter milk because these are companies that will be pushed down in value because people are using too higher this country that how do you make money you could be right and go bankrupt being right right So eventually there's got to be a moment of Reckoning where people say oh my God I didn't realize embryo was much safer company but how did you kind of went to constantly be wrong so what do you think brings this moment what is this reality checklist and then the next three days later embryo reports its earnings reports and they're coming out well and you say how the heck did that happen Brazil is going through this catastrophic internal risk and Emprise that's exactly what you're looking for you're looking for reality to eventually come you might have to wait a while for that to happen I'll tell you what what what I thought you know I've I've done this over the last 25 years one of the strategies I've adopted is first identify companies like Infosys like there's one or two companies in every Market perhaps more which have these characteristics which are listed in an Emerging Market get 70 80 percent of the revenues in a developed Market be careful don't look for just overseas revenues because as I said a Brazilian company the 80 of Venezuela is crude right it's not it's actually increasing risk making those companies don't do anything wait for a crisis do you think what if it doesn't come you're talking about an emerging market it's not a question of whether there'll be a crisis a question of when there'll be a crisis right and the crisis what happens people sell everything especially foreign institutional investors who are the biggest sheep on the face of the Earth right they're not even looking at the stock they're looking at each other they all flee the market at the same time they sell the good stuff the bad stuff there's your chat they pull out the list next time that market is in a crisis take the two companies Vietnam isn't a crisis by the milk you don't even have to do a valuation just buy it on the presumption that people are going to sell it and discriminately this is not an investment philosophies class but it's class about taking advantage of Market mistakes and this is I think a mistake that markets make is get too caught up in incorporation and where companies located rather than where it does business yes which most of those risks are cash flow risks right because if you're a company that you know you're in the regulatory risk is actually more in the safest parts of the world Parts like the EU right huge amounts of regular but they show up as costs so your margins tend to be lower your cash flows will be lower there's no need to adjust the discount rate now the way I describe discard rates is don't make them the receptacles for all your hopes and fears I see too many analysts saying how do I pump when in fact many of the things you worry about are cash flow effects if you have a capricious regulator who basically changes that's different right but to the extent that regulation causes costs build them in lower margins lower cash flows no need to adjust your discount rate for that okay so now let me open the door to a different way of thinking about Equity risk rates because all of this the talk of country risk agreements was built on a U.S premium right and I told you the historical premium approach doesn't work for me so I'm going to build up an implied using the example that I started the class with which is that when you show me what you pay for something whether you like it or not you're telling me what you expect to earn as a return and I can reverse engineer from that what your risk premium should be we do this in the bond market all the time right we call it a yield to maturity on a body what's a year to maturity in a bond takes the price of the bond takes the cash flows and the bond you solve for that discard rate that makes the present value of your cash flows equal to the price of the pawn I'm going to do something similar with the stock market and I'll go back to the start of 2020 to get this this ball rolling and I'm deliberately picking the start of 2020 because I want to make a point about Dynamic equity rescripts January 1st 2020 I'll make a confession I saw nothing coming I didn't see a virus I didn't see covet so no conspiracy-minded people here so you know I I none of that wasn't on the rise so I computed and implied Equity risk screen for the S P 500 sounds fancy but here's what I did I looked at what people were paying for the index three thousand three twenty and I said okay that's I know what they paid three thousand so that's what you're paying for stocks the 500 largest market cap stocks unlike a bond you're not going to get coupons and face value you expect or hope and pray you get cash flows from the stock they can take one of two forms they can take the form of dividends the old-fashioned ways companies used to return cash or BuyBacks unlike a coupon that number is not fixed but I can tell you what it was in the most recent year it was 150.5 I can even tell you what analysts collectively are expecting it to grow by for the next five years the S P 500 is the most tracked and followed index in the world it started twenty twenty twenty third projections for growth are about four percent here so here's what I did I took the cash flows grew them at four percent here for the next five years he's saying what happens after year five well remember these are the 500 largest market cap stocks in the US they can't keep growing at a rate faster than the US economy or profits are going to exceed the economy which is an impossible scenario so starting in year five I pushed the growth rate to the growth rate of the economy now you're going to see me do this over and over again in valuation but whenever I'm asked to estimate the nominal growth rate in the economy for the long term I've discovered the best predictors not some macro Economist forecast but the t-bondering the t-bond rate at the start of 2020 was one point 92 percent so basically have cash flows growing at 3.46 for the next five years 1.92 Beyond I set up the equation I know what you paid there are my cash flows I sold for it's like an internal rate of return for stocks like a year think of it as a year to maturity for stocks and that expected return to start 2020 was 7.12 what does that mean if you bought U.S stocks at the start of 2020 I don't care what you hoped you would make what you prayed you would make what you thought you would make given what you paid for those stocks you can expect to make 7.12 a year I'm almost there you subtract out the 1.9200 My Equity risk premium on January 1st 2020 was 5.20 percent all through January 2020 winners value companies that was my Equity risk premium for the US saying what happens on February 1st not much but things started happening on February 14th those of you don't remember that day that was the day the Italian government found 200 people in Italy were never been to China or on a cruise ship with covet we woke up to a nightmare right remember what we said shock hits the only thing you have to adjust is priceless it's not like cash flows are going to change overnight so starting on February 14th I actually started estimating the equity risk premium every day see how much can happen in a day a lot in a period like this the equity distribution is about 4.7 percent at this on February 14th by March 23rd had reached almost eight percent March 23rd was the absolute bottom of that crisis you go back and read the news stories from the day the world was ending you know I had for the you know go live in a cave it faded in fact one of the differences between this crisis the covet crisis the previous crisis how quickly the fear Faded by September you are back to where you were at the start of the year but the companies was valuing in March I had to use the eight percent equity risk cream otherwise I would be asking the wrong question well you know is this stock undervalued or I'll be bringing in a market View implied equitators premiums are forward-looking and dynamic they reflect the world you're in not the world you wish you were in if you're getting scared I'll reflect that in your premium and it's a premium that as I said will change over time and at the start of 2023 the applied equilateral script using exactly the same approach I used in 2020 was 5.94 now on top of a risk-free rate of 3.88 so I'm going going through the exact same process I do this actually at the startup every month on my website this premium gets updated I'll send you the February update right now I think it's 5.48 of 5.5 the actual premium but as I said this is my premium for the stocks I would value in February March who knows but March would break forward-looking Dynamic previews started 2023 I came to you and said the equity discrete was 5.94 and you're totally expected return is 9.82 percent he said well is that a good premium or a bad premium you're asking a question about the market itself right in fact you often wonder is the market overvalued undervalued is it in a bubble or is it busted you can reframe that question in terms of equity risk premiums if markets are undevalued stocks are undervalued you know what you're telling me about the equity risk premium right it's too low it needs to go up I'm sorry it's two heights needs to go down if on the other hand you tell me stocks are overvalued tell me the risk premium is too low I need it to go up every statement about the market is really a statement about Equity risk premiums so the start of 2023 what am I asking you are you okay with 5.94 is that enough of a premium admit it without perspective yes I have no idea so to fill in perspective guess what I'm going to do I'm going to show you what the equity risk premium has look like going back to 1960. to make a judgment on 5.94 is it high is it low is it average take a look at the graph we go all the way back to 1960 the premium across the period has been about 4.21 if I compare what I'm getting at the start of 2023 I'm actually getting a much higher premium than what I'd have earned on average interesting but the world has changed if you look at the last 20 years it's true the premium would have gone up to five percent you're still okay 5.94 but what about the post-crisis bid after 2008 it's true post crisis period if I put so almost if I compare to any of those three numbers feeling okay right this is my pushback against bubblers but they were surrounded by people who keep telling us markets in above them and it might be it might not be but I need some tangible basis for that and the equity risk screen remains like a thermometer that I can use there are they right because I'll tell you when you should have been worried about the equity risk take a look at the history right there's a 1960s incredibly stable period 1970 something is happening right what is happening in the 70s it's pushing up equitative screams inflation remember that inflation historically has been awful it's pushed remember when Ecuador screams go up stock prices are going down the two it's like born interest rates and bond prices seventies were an awful period great bull market 78 through 99 but by the end of 99 take a look at what the implied premium in the U.S was if I told you you could make two percent more on an expected basis by investing in stock supposed to probably say I'm not doing that but people who are right at the end of 99 they seemed to overlook that with whatever reason they bought stocks and of course he got the.com correction then he had a period of stability then you got the 2008 crisis this graph gives you the history of U.S Equity so the last thing everything's in there it is my one metric for measuring hey am I okay with markets where they are 5.94 percent it's not a bad premium now we can debate could is it possible that I've Mrs absolutely my earnings could be wrong my cash flows could be wrong but if you take it and convert into a standard error on my implied Equity risk premium the range I would get would be somewhere between 4.8 and 6.5 if you download the spreadsheet you can see my range so with an implied premium it range is 4.8 to 6.5 you remember what the range was when I used historical premiums one to nine of course I could be wrong but my chances of being closer to a number are much greater year because I have less to be uncertain about now if you go back a year the implied Equity risk agreement to start at 2022 was 4.24 percent by itself that's not bad right it's higher than the 60 or average but you know what the big difference was a year ago that 4.24 was on top of a risk-free rate of 1.51 my total expected return on stocks last year because I was building on such a low base it was one of the lowest numbers in history but you know why we took it where else were you going to go this is what low risk free rates did for a decade it said you have no choice you got to take six percent Returns on stocks and we did the cost of equity for U.S companies dropped to five and a half to six percent last year because you really had no choice the 2022 for me was a return to normalcy not an abnormal year because we're returning back to expected returns we used to have pre-2008 the collective expected return at the start of 2023 is now back close to 10 which we haven't seen since 2008. so people complain about 2022 being a bad year maybe they should be talking about the 2008 to 2021 as being the strangers that you're coming back from because we accepted returns and stocks so much lower then we perhaps should have because we really had no choice a couple of final graphs this Equity risk premiums the price of risk in the equity market right is there a price of risk in the bond market or what do we call that price of risk it's a default spread right so if I take b double a rated bonds and look at the default spreads the default spreads change over time this graph I'll actually take the black cloud is the bwa default B Double A's investment grade Bond so these are actually pretty safe bonds default spreads and bonds versus Equity risk breaks most of the time the two move together why because people perish they don't just panic at the equity Market they Panic everywhere and most of the time but there'll be two times in the last 25 years where the two markets have diverged one was in the late 90s take a look at the equilateral screens dropping that's a.com boom default spreads are actually staying elevated 1999 I could have given you two choices you could invest in equities collectively and make a two percent spread or you could buy a b double a rated Bond investment grade Bond and make a two percent default spread if we were rational you know what we should have been doing right at the end of 99 taking all our money out of stocks and putting it into a corporate bond because we were getting a better risk reward trade-off but we didn't then you get to 2001 you get 9 11. and the year in the months after 9 11 Alan Greenspan says I will not let the U.S economy go into recession the hubris of central bankers and here's what he did he essentially made the bond market feel that it's called the Greenspan but basically said I will not let people default so you can keep lending money and charge too lower spread and if you look at what's happening in the post 2001 time period there's the black line it's dropping off the fault spreads are dropping across the board Equity risk premiums are staying elevated now people trace 2000 2008 crisis to lots of different things Bank badly behaved Bankers subprime you know the common team across all of them was 2008 was the first Market crisis which was precipitated by what was happening in the bond market people were lending money not just describe people without credit worthiness but they were lending it without charging enough of a spread you can lend to whoever you want if you charge a fair enough right and 2008 it caught up with all of them take a look at what happened to default spreads in 2008 that was the adjustment and was it painful since then we're back into sick to 2022 equities default spread throws as well but I've learned to keep my eyes on the two because when they diverge something is going on which which will precipitate a correction one final graphing will end for the day that's price of risk and Equity was it is there a price of risk in the real estate market if you work in real estate there's a number called the cap rate the cap rate is what real estate people use to estimate the price of a property so if your cap rate is 10 and if a property with a one million dollar rental income you'll pay 10 million for the property it's like a cost of equity in real estate they never call it that but that's where the cap rate is If I subtract the risk-free rate from a cap rate I get the real estate risk premium if you look at this graph it looks very weird right if you look at the 1980s it looks like the real estate Equity risk premium is actually negative you're saying why would I invest in real estate if I am earning a negative premium when I did my MBA you know what the advice we were given was if you're an investor and if stocks and bonds you should try to buy a house you should invest in real estate the story was it moves independently or in the opposite direction as your financial assets it'll hedge your portfolio and we listened we listened to uh and somewhere the process breakdown broke down because as you can see starting in the mid 90s it looks like real estate is starting to behave like stocks and bonds so what the heck did we do to real estate to screw it up so much something we celebrated when we did it we we securitized it right starting with the 1980s lure and Yuri putting out mortgage by execute and you know what happens when you securitize an asset class it starts to behave like a financial asset class and that's terrible news for all of us because you own a house you have a lot of money in your pension find your own some bonds you have a bad year on your pension fund you look at your bond portfolio it's collapsed as well you say thank God I have my house and you call your realtor what can I sell the house for is it 25 less than you did last year real estate is no longer acting as a hedge the reason I do these graphs is we have tunnel vision in markets if any of you worked in investment Banks you work in equities only talk about is equities right and even not all equities your subset of equities you're working the bond market we have very few people who can step the reason at the end of 99 people weren't moving things was they're so stuck in that tunnel vision they couldn't see what was happening in other markets and hopefully this can help you get that perspective look across markets and get a sense of hey what is the price of risk in these markets and where do I get the biggest payoff to taking risk so that's about it I will see you on Wednesday whoever told me about the slides on on Zoom thank you for letting me know 
thank you very much slowly thank you yeah you know thank you yeah okay folks let's start now a couple of things before I get started one is um next week as you know Monday is a holiday President's Day so there will be no class on Monday and because Monday is on a holiday and I've decided to go back home for the week which is home for me is La Jolla California so I'm going home tomorrow morning I don't want to come back just for a Wednesday class so this is all about me anyway so it'll be a zoom session next Wednesday now so I will send you the link Link's already there and right but I'll send it again just to make sure you get it there will be a zoom session link the class will be on zoom and the biggest challenge for me in a big class is the gallery view and zoom allows 48 people and especially my undergraduate classes that's 350 that's six Gallery pages I remember not to stay stuck on the page hey but I've lived my life on Zoom now for three years it'll be okay it's it's perfectly okay so it'll be a zoom class Zoom length coming second is I I know you're feeling worried by the stuff that I sent right I mean you get it every day evaluation of the week you get a weekly challenge and um I pride myself on being a realist which is I would love for you to be obsessed with this class and forget about all your other classes the rest of your life your family your friends but that's not going to happen it's probably not healthy if it happens so the email I would send you I've already done this to my corporate finance class but I'll send it after this we'll essentially list out what I think is realistic given your time constraint so now obviously you need to set aside at least two times 80 minutes which is this lecture that's a minimum and then I say we have less than three additional hours to spend these are the four things I would focus on the valuation of the week is not going to be up there because you have something you know if you get the first cluster the reason I did this is uh I got an email yesterday from somebody who's clearly feeling incredibly overwhelmed and I will name the person but she said is it just enough if I read your emails every week I knew I was in trouble right I mean if this becomes a minimal standard of reading the emails it's getting the class but you can see why it happened so basically I've listed at zero to three hours this is what you should do three to six because what you should be doing six to ten then obviously you can do valuations a week weekly challenges and if you're one of those people who ends up being obsessed with the class and time is no longer constraint you don't have to sleep for 15 weeks you're willing to just spend it all in valuation I've given you a template of what to do as well but decide for yourself how much time you have on the class I I recognize that there are other things in your life and then be focused don't spend if you have two hours a week to spend on it don't do it on something that is a distraction rather than Central to the class so now watch for that email it'll give you at least a template on what you should be focusing on yeah are you kidding me why would I make you do that that'd be torture right I know you don't have to I could ask somebody to come and turn on would you rather watch it in the big screen no because I was planning on you just watching from wherever you are it'll be easier for you you know because there's nothing you're going to gain because it's not like you can you know you can ask questions directly from sitting in the in the lobby I would say find a much nicer place than this room to sit in if you're just going to watch the zoom no but you know it'll be an it'll be like a regular class you know just be live class you can put up your hand you can ask questions in fact there's a little more interaction on Zoom than it is in person because you know you often turn your face off so I can't see who you are you can just ask a question I'd prefer one thing I would like is for you to turn your cameras on because there's nothing more depressing than teaching to 48 gray boxes with names under them right I've done it it's just I I don't like it so if you can put your you know obviously don't do anything stupid like wear some clothes before you do this so if you're if you're going to do something crazy dude on some other somebody else's Zoom yeah so but it'll be you know so I work do what you can and obviously the more you do the more you will learn about valuation will it pay off as a higher grade there are some things in this class but it's not it's not for the grade you're doing it I mean the valuation of the week if you didn't do none of them could you get it's got nothing to do with your grade but I think if you so you have to decide what you want to take out of the class I'm not going to prejudge it for you because you have a life to live constraints to to me So today we're going to talk with we're going to finish the discussion of equity risk premiums and we're going to talk about betas okay how many we've taken a finance class already everybody should have but I'm gonna if you took my corporate finance class you're off the table so I'm going to put you to the side but take you know take any finance class how will we talk to us to make Vegas what what's what is the process what do we do run a regression or what against what no it's not riskless is return it's return versus return what returns [Music] for example against what regression needs to two Dimensions so one is the index what's the other historical data of the current security that we are around okay so it returns in a stock against returns in the index and it's made to seem like a fact right I mean it's written so I'm going to first test that proposition if beta is run is obtained by running a regression it returns in a stock against returns in a market index then let's go look at what that regression looks like I don't know how many of you have had a chance to access a Bloomberg terminal I was told this morning there's one on the fourth floor find a Bloomberg terminal pick your company and type in the word beta there'll be a beta page that pops up but the nice thing about the Bloomberg terminal is you can actually change the parameters of the beta page so let me be specific this is a company called petrogressive families Brazilian oil company a few years ago six seven years ago I wanted to look up the beta you know I'm trying to think of my finance class go to another aggression I said okay I'll go run a regression so I ran a regression of petrobras the first regression I put up was petrobras against the bavespa why because Bloomberg is very parochial about the way it runs regressions you ask for a Brazilian company it'll run it against the your Indian company against the sensex German company against the Dax we'll talk about whether that's good or bad but that's the regression I got so that's a regression to the left the but remember I can go change the parameters so I said okay it's petrobras why don't I take the ADR which is the dollar based security and running regression against the s p 500. there's my petrol price ADR Ian so I'm going to ask you a question and this is going to start unraveling the entire myth that you can run a regression to get a beta if I ask you which of these two regressions should you use because remember this beta goes into your cost of equity so using a 1.66 beta is going to give you a lower cost of equity than 1.98 if I ask you which of these two regressions would you use anybody have a choice and to tell me why yes it's exactly where most analysts go they think this is a statistical game that a higher r squared gives you later but you do you have an alternate View ERS so tell me something tell me so if you pick a base and tell me give me an answer I mean they're evaluating there's only one valuation you're going to get right so frame yourself so pick whatever role you want to play and give me a different answer yes so you do it in dollars you should use the S P 500 you see how all the differences so one is high R square the other is currency third is where is the investor located if it's in the US looking at petrobats this is the kind of mess we get ourselves into you know what the right answer here is these are both screwed up numbers they're screwed up numbers because they're slopes from a regression and there's a selection bias that comes from which index I could run a third regression against the msci global index or a Latin American index or an oil company index I'll get different betas they're all crappy a because they're not capturing risk in petrobras because ultimately what's your objective find a true beta they can't be 17 true betas it's got to be one you say which one of these and second I think again we remember we talked about forgetting statistics when we did historical risk premiums and a big Achilles heel with historical risk premiums with a standard error I'm going to pull that card out of the deck again the standard error of the beta reflects the range so even if you took one of these betas you're not getting a fact you're getting a range on the beta I haven't used a regression beta to value a companies in probably 30 plus years now obviously that leaves me in as part of hey this is the way we're teaching people to estimate betas how come you're not using it I'll give you my alternative but I'll also tell you that whenever I do valuation it's amazing how the discussion or debate or arguments all become about beta which strikes me as absurd do you think in my Tesla evaluation that my Beta was my big assumption it wasn't even in my top 10 list to be quite honest but people focus in because they just don't like bearish it's it's deep it's deeply entrenched people and it could be analysts could be investors Warren Buffett has been famous for saying you know he just doesn't like baiters Charlie Munger uses even more salty language in that chart he says use the salty language pretty much everything to describe what he thinks about babies but I'm going to put you in the camp of people who are skeptical Barbados which should be all of us and I'm going to give you four reasons for disliking betas and I want you to tell me which of these reasons you might attach yourself to because everybody distrusts bet it's including me here's the first one and this is not including me there there are a group of people who think adjusting for risk is a waste of time that every company should have won this contract it's amazing where they come up the number 10 cost of capital I will use it for the last 35 years I'm not going to change surprising number of investors see where the 10 came from I have no idea but it's got firmly launched in this person's head and guess what when I put out my costly Capital this year the median costed capital for a company was around 10 they said there I told you so this is like a clock that's stuck at 12 o'clock but twice every day you're going to be on time right it's no way to do evaluation but that's one group hopefully none of you are in that group because that makes no intuitive sense to say every company is equally risky I'm going to charge the same discount rate but the other three are all legitimate reasons to push back against payers remember at the start of this class I talked about the difference between value and price and value is that is driven by cash flows and growth and risk and price is driven by demand and supply so when we do intrinsic valuation we're trying to insulate ourselves in the market and think about how much is this business worth how do we get betas but running a regression of past returns which come from prices so the second argument this is especially if you go to a place like Omaha the middle of the Berkshire Hathaway meetings this will be the central point of how come you're using a pricing based measure of risk to do an intrinsic valuation isn't it inconsistent and there's in a sense inconsistent right because if I believe in intrinsic value maybe I should use some intrinsic numbered maybe earnings maybe cash flows look at the variance over time the third is whenever you use betas remember you're assuming that the only risk that you get rewarded for is the risk you cannot diversify away and we talked about how every risk and return model in finance assumes the marginal investor is Diversified you could say I don't like that assumption most investors are three to five stocks the fact that Fidelity and and Vanguard have lots of companies doesn't mean I should rethink my way of risk so maybe a problem with betas is not that they come from prices or that they could be wrong it's just you think all risks should be built into your discount rate and the final argument is a mechanical argument which is you're okay with the price using prices you're okay with the Diversified investor assumption you just don't like the mechanics of how we estimate betism because as you saw with petrobras it's not a number it's a range of numbers depending on the choices you make the reason I push people to tell me what makes them uncomfortable are bad is is a solution I'm going to offer is going to be very different depending on what your disagreement and today I'm going to talk about hey what if I don't like price-based measures and I'm going to give you Alternatives you can use they say what if I don't believe investors are Diversified I'll give you Alternatives if you say what if I don't trust the mechanics of estimating betas I'll give you an old third that I think is a much more robust much more intuitive way of thinking about bet is we're not asking you know should I run a regression against the Vespa or against the S P 500 . so we have a fair amount on our plate let's go back to just mopping up the implied Equity risk premium section we were in it's and and and finish up our discussion of equity risk so we start with historical risk premiums and we very quickly concluded that it's a great way to look at risk backwards but for it's not forward-looking it's not Dynamic I gave you the alternative implied Equity restraints I know whether I convinced you or not but at least I want you to start thinking about a forward-looking way of thinking about risk premiums that changes as the world changes around you I also looked at how the price of risk and Equity markets is connected to the price of risk and bond markets the price of risk in real estate markets so let's go back to implied Equity response because as I said I've been trying to sell people on this practice now for probably 25 years so one of the places I would go make the sales pitch is an equity research department at investment Banks or any kind of m a group or a lot of people are doing valuation I said look historical risk premiums don't make sense because they're backward looking and set you need a forward-looking premium especially given your mission which is to value a company given where the market is today and the response I would get at many of those places it doesn't matter that much you say what do you mean it doesn't matter he said all our analysts use the same Equity risk premium and as long as we use the same Equity risk what does it matter if it is wrong so I want to push you on that premise so let's assume that every person in an investment bank is using 8.17 percent as an equity risk that's a historical arithmetic average stocks are vertebrates and they've always done so everybody uses 8.16 and let's say the implied premium is 5.94 percent I have a very simple methodological question which is if every analyst is using an 8.17 premium and the market is pricing things to the 5.94 premium what is it analyst after analyst in the room going to find if they do their valuations honestly you can do cash flows right what are you doing to your discount rate by using an 8.17 premium you're pushing it up above what it should be you're pushing down the value and every single stock you value is going to look over value you can't live as an equity research analyst for that right so you know what they do they play games with the earnings and the growth rates to get to about it's a it's a extraordinarily unhealthy thing to do but you can see why it happens if I impose a discount rate that really cannot be justified in today's markets they find me no 50 stock should be buys you are going to mess up the earnings in the cash flows in fact the other thing that happens in implied premiums is they'll just make up premiums to be lower and lower just to get by recommendation I'll use three percent I'll use two percent so even if you decide to not go the implied Equity risk premium route at least be aware of what it is so when you use a premium that's different from that number you know what is causing you to find your stock to be undervalued so on May 8th of 2023 when you turn into evaluation if you decide to override the equity implied premium that's in the market then let's say it's five percent and you decide to use four percent and you find your company to be undervalued and they ask me to buy I'm going to push back and ask you do you want me to buy this company because it's undervalued or do you want me to buy this company because you think the S P 500 should be 25 because implicitly by using a four percent premium you're sending me a message about the overall Market I firmly believe that if you want to value a company without bringing in Market views you have to at least be close to the implied premium because otherwise you're going to get a market effect built into valuations any questions on that Dimension so I want to give you the ammunition because people are going to say we will always use six percent as an equity risk premium here why are you asking us to use this ever shifting number the answer is you have a job to do and that job requires that you be closed to where the market is but let's step back from this right I mean we can debate historical versus implied versus you know with some other way of estimating what are we trying to do we're trying to forecast what the market will do in the future right so let me give you my premise on a good Equity risk a good measure of equity risk premium should be a reasonably good forecast for what Equity markets will do in the future in other words if I give you the equity risk premium now and I give you what returns are in the next 10 years a good Equity risk scripture at least move in tandem so I I've been you know I've been Computing these implied premiums now since 1960. their historical premiums going back to 1928. so here's what I did I took four different ways of estimating Equity restraints one is just use the current implied premium as I said each month I do this I'll use that for the rest of the month the second is you might want to smooth it out why because it makes you feel more comfortable you're saying that's more stable okay that's what you do the third is you can use a historical pre which is what ninety percent of people do or the Ford is used actually a very simplistic way of getting Equity risk groups remember that graph I showed you of the b double a default spread versus the implied Equity risk premium over the last 55 years if you look at those two numbers the equity risk room has been roughly two times the b double a default spread so the b double a default spread is two and a half percent yeah it's a very simplistic way but you can say look I can go observe the bwa spread in the market double it and becomes My Equity risk and then I checked to see how well these four approaches forecast future returns by looking at the correlation with the actual returns next year the actual return to the next five years and the actual returns in the next 10 years remember you want a high positive correlation that means you're so let's start with the worst way of estimating equilateral scripts take a look at the correlation Matrix remember you're looking for high positive numbers what's the stand out here in the wrong direction if you're going to pick a horrifically bad way to estimate Equity risk premiums historical premiums actually push you in the wrong direction right when you get high historical premiums you get low Returns on stocks in the future so I said I don't understand why people are so stuck on historical premiums but I think one reason is they've lost the script this is not about getting a number for last year it's about forecasting the future and it does the worse and if you look across the other numbers you can see actually why I stick with current implied premiums it turns out that smoothing it out might make you feel better but it's not giving you a better forecast the current implied premium actually gives you a better forecast of returns than using a smooth DOT number you don't like my implied premiums fine just double the default spread you're going to be better off than using a historical risk premium it's an observable number go to the bond market see the default spread multiply by two move on you're actually going to get a better estimate of the equity risk premium than using a historical premium okay find a loose ends on implied premiums remember why I could not compute historical risk premiums for Vietnam or uh Cambodia or a Myanmar or no Bulgaria there's not enough historical data right because you need how many years of data 100 years 200 years 300 years and you're not going to get what do I need for an implied premium go back to the S P 500 calculation I need a level for the index right now right I need to know what the cash flows were on the companies dividends and BuyBacks last year and I need forecasted growth on these dividends cash flows I don't need any historical data I could do this for any Market I mean we talk about the estimation challenges but this is actually an implied Equity risk premium computed for the sensex in 2007. the index was at fifteen thousand four forty six right like the s p fund at the level of the index when I looked at the cash flows life was actually simpler with Indian companies and with us companies because there were no BuyBacks it was just debit so I took the collective dividends and then I forecast out a growth rate and here it was a little trickier and like the S P 500 we have all these people forecasting long-term growth but Indian companies people weren't forecasting and so I cheated I took a subset of companies that had adrs which are listings in the US or gdrs listing in the UK and they had five-year growth rate so that's the weakest link here but at a 14 forecast of growth for the next five years and then after year five what do I do I do exactly what I do for the s p 500. You could argue maybe I should have used 10 years of growth it's a growing market and that's fine that's it that's a that's an estimation issue when I solve for the irr I get 11.18 based on what Indian investors were paying for stocks at in 2007 they can expect to make a premium of expect to make a return of 11.18 you subtract out the risk-free rate and rupees because everything was done in repeat terms the implied Equity risk premium was 4.42 percent where would I use it if you're valuing an Indian company in September of 2007 the equity risk point for India is 4.42 I'm completely bypassing remember the way we went through it last week the contortions we had to go through start of the mature Market premium look up the default spread multiplied by one point forward we're saying let me skip that so the plus of this approach is you're going directly to the equity risk premium the minus is you're probably going to have to deal with some estimation challenges but I'll tell you why I think it's useful to compute this premium especially for a market like India last session when I computed Equity risk premiums by country and I started with the mature Market Prem and added spreads and I added Equity restrooms I was taking the perspective of an investor who has Global choices I want to take the investor we I was not it's not a U.S investment it could be a German investor it could be UK it could be a Singapore investor if I have choices I'm going to direct my money to countries based on whether I'm getting a sufficient Equity risk premium so in much of the world my map works fine but in India it kind of gets crimped by a very simple problem Indian investors have opportunities to invest outside India but they're severely constrict so if you're in Mumbai they say I'd like to buy a thousand shares of Facebook because it looks like the US market is giving me a much better Equity risk premium it's not like you can go online so look buy me a thousand shares of Facebook you might buy a mutual fund and there are some in India that offer you U.S exposure and even that's an improvement over 10 or 15 years ago where Indian investors had only one choice you could invest in Indian stocks or Indian stocks so if you thought 4.42 was too low a premium in 2007 unlike a German investor U.S investor would have put their money outside Indian investors were kind of stuck and that's not healthy because here's what happens you have no choice so you're going to keep pushing up the prices right see by Asian paints you're paid 48 times earnings for a good company but clearly much more than you should be paying because you know where else am I going to go so bubbles get created and eventually even Indian investors say I'm paying too much for these stocks so you sell stocks and what do you do you move the bubble elsewhere and you buy real estate real estate is a bubble hit bus you got a gold you're you have this moving bubble all over the place because you have no escape hatch China is a very into the same problem they've tried for the last 20 years to open up invest Investments for Chinese domestic investors outside but there are still significant constraints he said why was it why isn't this always been a promise it's always been a problem but 40 years ago India and China were small countries with small economies with not much wealth right but we have the second and the fifth largest economies in the world with these constraints you have a problem that's going to play out in markets later when we get to the appraiser you're going to see Indian stocks as the highest price earnings ratios and you can tell a good fundamental story for it but part of that is the fact that you kept this no almost unnatural Demand by keeping invest Indian investors hemmed into Indian markets so implied Equity restrooms might sometimes you're going to invest in an Indian company you might say look I'm going to get a more realistic valuation of a company by using the implied premium today than using this artificial mature Market premise country risk premiums you're right but you're assuming you have to invest in an Indian company so my guess is I will find probably 20 percent of Indian companies undervalued even if the Indian investor fund because as an outsider I have choices I don't have to invest in Asian paints and that's something to factor in when you think about what an equity or scream is trying to measure yes they said you go to the risk reader exactly the same way I got into the asset remember after five years what do we do is set it equal to the risk-free rate because that becomes a nominal growth rate that's why I said for a country like India where you might think potent higher just Increase five to ten and then at the end of ten years you still have to put in the risk eventually your growth rate has to converge in the risk credit but we can debate whether it should be not after a longer period for growing economies than for more mature economies one final page and then I will let this topic go start of every year as you know if this gigantic data exercise I go through I call it my money ball week it's always the first week of the year it's a great way to start the new year right I watch the movie first puts me in a good mood and then I download every publicly traded stock in the world this is the nice thing about s p Capital like you it takes me 20 minutes to download 300 data items and every single one of forty seven thousand publicly traded companies and one of the things I do in addition to Computing all of the data items is I divide those 47 000 plus countries into two groups develop markets in emerging markets and I make a confession I have to make some judgment calls for which I get backlash from both sides how dare you put Portugal in the Emerging Market side or how dare you do this and you know what I'm not doing this to insult you as a country I've got to put you somewhere and I'm going to put you on this side of the line so but I'm going to try so that about 25 000 emerging market stocks 21 000 developed market stocks and I compute an implied cost of equity just like I did for the s p 5 we did across those 25 000 developed market stocks and the 21 000 emerging market stocks so let me go back to the start of 2004. startup 2004 if you looked at how developed market stocks were priced and think about Computing an implied return these are all in dollar terms I can compare apples to apples 7.28 the emerging market stocks in the same day 10.55 percent that difference is what investors are charging for buying emerging market stocks and I could tell you a story right Emerging Market companies are riskier therefore you're charging a higher pring the nice thing about being able to track this number over time is you can get a sense of what investors think about this developed Emerging Market divide over time and you can take a look at the last column because that's the one that matters the most and take a look at what hap what's happened to that number over time so you can see it drifting down there's a blip up in 2008. and then it keeps drifting down and down and down in fact at the start of 2012 emerging market stocks were priced to earned roughly the same expected return in dollar terms as developed markets you might not remember the stories that were being told that but the story was 2008 has changed the game there is no such thing as a developed or an Emerging Market we're all Emerging Markets are all developed markets depending on the story you want to tell Brazilian stocks Indian stocks U.S stocks German stocks who really cares where you're from and markets that pushed the expected returns down now I didn't buy into that story I thought I I the basis for the story was okay but it seemed like there's still a difference to me between emerging and developed markets and you can see after 2012 there's a bounce back but it's a bounce back not to 2004 level so this is how I would describe what this this table tells me there's still a divide between emerging and developed markets but that divide is far smaller than it was 15 years ago 20 years ago 25 years ago and there's a lot more gray areas a lot more countries where I'm not sure what to put you so if you gave me Malaysia and you gave me Spain I'm not sure which country should go on which side of the Divide because the differences have started to kind of melt so it's a number that I track just to get a sense of what's Happening across markets but it's again that technique of computing an implied expected return that I wanted to take away so any questions at all about Equity risk cream so I'm kind of done with it I'm going to put it behind but it'll come back when you do your company's a risk premium there will be issues so we'll talk about issues as they come up but I want to talk about betas I'm sure as I said we're all taught beta is the same ironic regression the slope of the line is a beta horrifically bad way to think about betas because first it takes away all economic meaning right you think betas come from a regression they come from a service you stop thinking about what are the economics of theirs but there are far deeper problems with regression base one is this issue of standard error how noisy and you're going to be surprised that the magnitude of standard errors you're going to get a debate is for some companies second no matter how well you run a regression it's looking backwards right so if your business mix has changed as a company you're changing as a company your beta even if it's right is not going to capture your company as it is today it's going to capture your company as it was over the last five years in the last two years and third whenever you computer regression bait embedded in there is how much debt did you use and you can already see that's the number that shifts over time as well so very quickly let me start to dig a hole for regression beta so I can bury it so let's start with the first prop what did I say standard error right so this is a few years ago about four years ago and GoPro was soaring as a company you know what GoPro does right basically makes cameras for overactive over sharing people who put it on their head and go for three hour hikes and expect you to be fascinated at all the grass they're seeing along the way okay but GoPro for a while was this soaring company and I've you know valued it like five years ago six years ago on my blog and I went looking for a regression bait it was about a year and a half or two years into its listing and I got a number right so if you look at Bloomberg's description page for GoPro it'll reflected it would have shown a beta 1.4 and that's one reason you have to be careful about that descriptive page because they picked a number out of this regression first that's really not the regression paid it's it's what's called an adjusted beta we'll talk about that in a minute but the regression rate is 1.60 they've had a third decimal point 1.604 before you get too excited about those decimal points take a look at the standard error of the beta see it 0.497 you know what that tells you right even if you trust the regression beta to be 1.60 with a 0.50 standard error the true beta can be anywhere from 0.6 to 2.6 you might as well not run the regression you think what's your adjustment it sounds fancy right your visions of five people at Bloomberg sitting around the table saying how do we adjust GoPros beta maybe they're all wearing GoPros while they estimate GoPros beta because you can post it online say look how exciting our estimation was there's no people involved you know what the adjusted rate is for every company in Bloomberg it's a raw beta times two-thirds if you don't trust me pick up any company look it up it's a raw beta times two-thirds plus one third times one what your regression rate is 1.8 I'll make it 1.53 1.5 will become 1.33 0.6 will become 0.73 this is a regression beta move towards one services use terms like predicted beta adjusted beta there's nothing predictor adjustable under the regression way to move towards one good reasons or bad reasons but they're all crappy betas you take a beta with the range from 0.6 to 2.6 you move towards one it doesn't get less crappy that's a standard error problem just in case you're tempted by this great looking beta you should be even more terrified when you get a beta page that looks like this is a beta page I printed for Nokia in 2000 right after I think we got our first Bloomberg terminal this is a statistics class I'd get a prize right 93 r squared standard error close to zero every point is on the line but the reason is very simple take a look at the index I'll be quite honest when I ran this regression I thought I was regressing against a Witch's Curse so the hex has always been to me you know the hexes stands for the Helsinki exchange you're saying what the heck is Nokia going to Helsinki for I'm sorry is it Bloomberg going to Helsinki but because Nokia is a Finnish company they went to Helsinki because as I said they're incredibly parochial you see what the what the problem with this regression is going to be I had no idea what was in the heck so I went and took a look I wish I had not because at that point in time I think Nokia owned Finland 80 of the index either everybody works for Nokia has all their money Nokia God only knows what what was happening but this is a regression of Nokia against Nokia and what are we finding an awful lot of the time the two move together surprise but this is a completely useless regression right because you know who the largest single investor in Nokia was in 2000 is Barclays as part of the global Index Fund if you're adding Nokia to your portfolio maybe Global Index Fund you're not going to run the regression against a hex you're going to run against the msci and guess what you're going to find a big step standard errors are a feature the big noise term that I complained about are always going to be there if you run your regression right and finally you could see the game you know what happens when you take one slice of History remember we're running a regression two years three years you think that's a lot of time all you need is one big event during that period where your stock is pushed in one direction for an extended no two months or three months your beta is going to go to hell in a handbasket remember GameStop became this this target for redditors and you can have you know you can think it's a good but nobody would have contested you if you said GameStop is a risky company right this is in February stock had gone from 20 to 400 back to 150 so I looked up the beta page you know what Bloomberg told me the beta for GameStop was minus 0.62 they were telling me to liquidate all my treasuries and put my money in GameStop it's it's beyond riskless it actually is gonna it's nonsensical you know why it's beta they're negative right what does beta measure it measures how much your stock moves in relation to the market so if your stock that keeps moving up no matter what the market does guess what's going to happen to your beta the correlation is going to drop towards zero it might go turn negative you're going to get a negative beta anytime your company becomes the center of attention in good ways or bad ways Mark Spader went towards zero during the bioxx lawsuits because every every day all you'd be watching for is what's happening in the lawsuits so bad isn't noisy you can't trust them and they look bad you can't trust them and they look good they're a function of the time they could be screwed up and finally the gameplay remember those two betas that I showed you 1.69 and 1.96 for petrobras this is actually Bombardier the Canadian company I ran a regression against the Canadian exchange the U.S exchange let's say the obvious debate is going to be different you think who cares remember we talked about bias at the start of this class this is an instrument for bias right you want to increase the value of your company sit in front of a Bloomberg keep playing with the index starting point ending point weekly monthly until you get a really low beta print that page off because that'll document that you actually have backing and then use the beta nobody will know that you tried 57 iterations before you got this one next time you see a banker show a Bloomberg beta page ask them a question how many beta pages did you try before you got to this page they will lie said no this is the only page I got it right right this is a recipe for disaster no matter how you slice it which means that we've got to think about different ways of estimating betas so let me offer you some Alternatives okay the biggest reason you know that many value investors don't value companies which strikes me as a strange thing you claim to be a value investor but you don't value companies is they'll tell you it's because they don't like Payless this is like saying you don't like a surgeon because he has no hair he's not operating you with his head he's he's using a hand so you're picking the wrong argument you don't like betas I'll give you some more tarps and as I said the alternates will depend on why you don't like painters let's start with the the with the question do you believe in price-based measures and you say look I don't trust price-based measures then I'm going to give you a measure of risk that's based on accounting data remember you're jumping out of the frying pan Into the Fire because when you say you don't trust price-based measures and I give you accounting numbers you are trusting somebody right this so you're you're saying I trust accountants more and if you do then I can give you accounting earnings based measures of risk if you stay no no I believe in price-based measures then I can give you alternates cap him the Arbitrage pricing model the multi-factor models I'm also going to ask you do you believe that risk should be measured Through The Eyes of an investor who's Diversified and if you say no I don't like that then I'm going to come up with measures of of how to adjust that risk for the fact that investors are not diversifying in other words you tell me what it is about betas you don't like I'll give you an alternative measure of risk that works for you because what all I need is a number that replaces the beta right so here are some choices if you do not like the focus on marginal investors being Diversified here are three ways you can measure risk and they're going to end up looking like betas remember when you use betas you're looking at the portion of the variance that cannot be Diversified the covariance term but that assumes that the rest of the variance is diversifiable so here's one fix if that's what you're caught up on why not look at total standard deviation so let's say the total standard deviation in your stock is 50 so basically take the stock computer standard deviation by itself you think what am I going to do with 50 I'm going to compute that standard deviation for every company in the market not difficult to do and then I'm let's say the average across companies is 20 percent so your company's standard deviation is 50 the average company standard deviation is 20 I'm going to divide the 50 by the 20. I'm going to end up with a number that looks like a beta right 2.50 I'm going to replace the beta with this number and say this is the number that captures total risk you don't like betas use this instead the second is to use what are called proxy marks and proxy models you basically let something standard for us can people do this all the time tech companies are riskier and consumer product companies therefore I'm going to give them a higher cost of equity I don't like labeling all because tech companies now have some of the safest companies in the face but people do this because they don't want to use betas instead they want to use a sector they want to use the size of the company large companies and safe small companies are risky but basically these are proxy models now one of them we'll talk about some of the ways traditionally Services of classified companies more often they use proxies and finally there's a third set of models called capm plus markets you see what are those the Kappa we have a risk free rate plus beta times risk premium right lets you plug the numbers in and you come up with a cost of equity of eight percent for your company you look I said that looks too low any of those based on your history I mean so you know what you do you add some numbers on of course you can't just make up numbers so you look for basis for doing it lots of people when they estimate cost of equity for companies add what's called a small cap premium for small companies what is that an extra four and a half percent where did that come from it comes from fiction basically it comes from historical data that no longer backs it up but people keep using it widespread bad practices once they get embedded in valuation never leave then you'll add in the liquidity premium this company is not liquid you see where you're going to go right you're going to keep adding premiums till you get to the numbers I feel good with that which my response is why don't you just use that number in the first place why go through the charade of acting like you used to risk it you introduce 20 use the damn 20 don't look for ways to get there by acting like you're using a modern but that's effect in fact desperation time is when Anna's at what's called a company specific risk premium now you're truly desperate you're saying I need to get to 20 I can't quite get there with the small cap room I'm going to add an extra seven percent and to give it a facade of this is for companies what does that even mean company specific risk if your problem is with markets and prices okay I understand lots of people don't trust markets the question has how much do you trust accountants he said I don't trust accountants either then you're truly lost right because if you trust accountants then you can use earnings I can give you an earnings follow 30 measures let's say your standard deviation earnings is 30 and the typical company standard deviation earnings is 25 I'm going to divide notice how I try to make a number look like a beta because ultimately the nice thing about beta is is a scale so I'll divide the 30 by the 25 I come up with 1.2 that becomes an accounting beta if you want to call it that you could use debt ratios and say companies high debt are riskier but again you're replacing betas with an accounting numbers I trust that is my basis for risk services used to come up with these ranking systems for you know value language around for 50 plus years it isn't used by very many people anymore because it's stuck in time in the 1970s used to classify stocks into five risk classes one two three four five and basically no they put the safest dogs in one the riskiest stocks in five there are a bunch of things they claimed to use but that our analysts still do that break companies down risky safe and essentially use a higher discount rate for the risky companies an average discount rate for the savings you know what if that Rings your bell I can go along with that you know I want to get to the cat cash flows this is not where I want to fight so what I'm saying is don't let betas become your Battlefield don't argue with people about using betas it's not worth the effort it's not going to create the kind of consequence you want so I asked them what they would use instead then try to make it into a scale measure and move on but I'm going to take you back to what I think is a more healthy discussion available ultimately don't come from regressions they don't come from Bloomberg they don't come from Barra they don't come from Services they come from choices you make as a company and in particular three choices you make as a company drive your beta the first is what kind of business are you in what do you do what do you sell I used to use cyclical versus non-cyclical as a dividing line for companies I no longer do the question I often ask is how discretionary is the product or service you offer as a company you know what I mean by discretionary if your customers can delay buying this product they can defer buying this product you have a higher beta that if you have a product or service your customers cannot live with that so I'd expect grocery stores to have lower betas the discount retailers discount retailers to have lower betas than department stores and department stores have lower weights and luxury retailers in fact in econ what do we do how do we measure discretion there's a there's an econ term for it right it's elasticity of demand every other class you take is in service of this class you can see why you take an econ class one of the few useful things you get out of the class is the elasticity of demand companies with products that have highly elastic demand have higher base so that's the first stop what kind of business are you in second stop tell me something about your cost structure how much of your costs a fixed cost and how much a variable cost you're saying why does it matter if you have lots of fixed costs in Good Times you make lots of money right in bad times you lose lots of money everything gets magnified businesses with high fixed costs it's called operating Leverage we'll end up with higher betas than businesses with low fixed costs Airlines High beta businesses because think of the cost structure for now and almost everything is fixed hotels High beta business unless you have an entrant who decides to bypass and have a very different business model so who's disrupted the hotel business Airbnb right we can debate about airbnb's future but one thing they bring to the table is a more flexible cost structure so in 2020 when covet hit and the hospitality business shut down Airbnb basically scaled down to zero right this is nothing but mayor but Hilton and and and Marriott could not the hotels were still there you were stuck with so tell me something about a cost structure the greater the proportioning costs that have fixed costs so even within businesses you can see businesses have different bays and finally tell me how much you borrowed why does it matter because when you borrow money you create a fixed cost you did not have until you borrowed the money which is what's a fixed cost that comes from borrowing money interest expense you've got to make it in good times you've got to make it in bad times your Equity earnings get more volatile your beta would reflect it so rather than think of what does Bloomberg tell me the beta for my company is start off by thinking about what your company does I'd be serious don't even look at a beta say if I were reasoning my way to a beta for this company would I expect to see a high beta an average beta or a low beta that's the opening I'm going to use to try to come up with a better beta which beta as it's each business has its own beta what happens when you have a mutual fund what happens about mutual fund most towards one conglomerate base unless you borrowed money to buy all those businesses in which case all bets are off right but there's no mystery here you're in 50 businesses you have 50 betas you take the weighted average as a bait of your company so here's the process by which I'm going to try to come up with the replacement for regression bases and as I go through at least at a step you're going to ask but you're still using regression betas and I will be but I'll explain why it's okay I can still get to an end game I'm going to start off by estimating the beta of the business you're in discretionary non-discretionary if I can there's a big if I if there I'm going to try to adjust the difference in operating leverage so you're Southwest you have much lower fixed costs than a typical Airline I want to adjust your beta for those lower fixed costs but I'll tell you the Practical challenge you're going to face in adjusting for operating leverage which is one reason I don't do it very often and finally I'm going to bring in how much financial leverage you have as a company and in doing all of this I'm not just looking at what you look like today I can be preemptive and look at what you might look like in the future so let's start with the first the question of can I adjust for operating Leverage you know how a measured operating leverage fixed cost and variable cost right so one measure of operating leverages take the fixed cost a company has and divide by the variable costs if you can give me fixed and variable costs for every company in a sector adjusting for operating Leverage is actually trivial I can actually adjust every company's paid for operating Leverage but there's an information problem I challenge you to open up the income statement for any company in the world and tell me based on the income statement which costs are fixed and which which are variable because accountants don't break things in a fixed in variable is cost of goods sold there's sgna you can try to guess and say sgnas probably fixed cost of goods sold is probably variable but really there's no dividing line the reason I don't adjust for operating Leverage is not because we don't know how to adjust for operating leverages we don't have the ammunition so give me a steel company you know what I'm going to do I'm going to assume it's operating Leverage is very similar to that of other steel companies unless you have an outlier like Southwest where you have to try to figure out how to adjust for it it's best not to try there's not enough information it's not just about your company but about every other company in the sector now in financial leverage we have a much cleaner way doing it because companies do have to break out debt and Equity I mean sometimes accountants can't get their heads around what that is and we'll come back to that issue but there's debt and there's Equity everything in market value terms because beta is a market risk driven concept I'll give you the conventional way in which you adjust verbatas it's 50 years plus old but I'll give you the limits of the approach and why some people have trouble with basically the way you're just verbat is you start with the odd level beta so think of the odd level bet as the beta coming out of the business here and after adjusting for operating leverage so you have a number and then I ask you how much debt you have and I measure how much debt you have with the debt to equity ratio so the more debt you have the higher the debtor equity ratio so all I do is I take the unlevered beta and I scale it up to reflect how much you debt to equity relations see what's a one minus t doing in there why is there a one minus t in there debt creates a it creates a fixed cost but the government puts his arm around your shoulder so that's okay we'll soften the blow but by making it tax deductible they don't do that with equity so it acts as a partial cushion on that fixed cost it's called the Hamada beta it's estimated in the early 70s and it makes sense it makes an assumption that some of you might be uncomfortable with them it assumes that all the non-diversifiable risk in a company a market risk in a company is born by just the equity investors put differently the beta of debt is zeros not that debt is riskless but it has no Market risk attached which if you're a triple a double a single a even a triple beta company is not a bad assumption because what drives that trade is interest rates into fall spreads not what's happening in the company Bonds in a in a B rated or Triple C rated company there are high you know these are high you bots you know what they behave like they behave like stock right there's an equity component in other words the beta of debt is not zero so again people pick these things to make that their Battleground they say I don't like the way you're just verbators because I think the beta of debt is not zero open up the discussion okay so tell me what the beta of debt is they then Bluster inside I don't know what it is but I know it's not zero because if I can estimate the beta of debt I can actually adjust my beta for that because effectively I'm sharing my risk with the lenders right that's effectively what I'm doing is I'm taking risks that used to be entirely in my shoulders say hey you guys share some of this risk if you're interested in estimating beta data I actually have an entire section and I'll send you that section I never use it because I have never felt the urge to adjust for the bait of dead but if you have somebody who's a pure says I need a bait of debt I need to adjust it again the mechanism exists if you choose to take it it's a long story if you ask me to estimate the beta for a company rather than run a regression on Bloomberg or look up a beta I'm going to build up to a beta I call it call this a bottom-up beta you can call it whatever you want but here's what I do I start with the company and I look at what business of business is it even if it's a conglomerate I've done this with GE so 26 different businesses so let's say you're two businesses casinos and tobacco why because you want to drive the ESC people crazy you think you're going to fossil fuels just to piss them off so casino and tobacco she said I want a beta for my company here's what I'm going to do I'm going to go find as many publicly traded Casino companies as I can let's say I find 100 Casino companies and as many publicly traded what does my other sin tobacco 100 tobacco companies so publicly traded so what can I look up for each of them I can look up a beta for each of them hang in there you sing but you told me you don't like regression Vegas I'm going to start so I'm going to have a hundred Casino betas 100 tobacco baits I take the average I'm going to have an average tobacco company made in an average Casino company beta others betas that have debt in them or not are those leveled or unlevel baits he never thought about this until now right our regression bait is laboratory and levered they love it they reflect the debt the company had and if I know go and collect the debt to equity ratio for Casino companies the debt to equity ration for tobacco companies I can cleanse those betas it's called on Leverage but I'm taking out the effect I'm going in the opposite direction I'm going from 11 Bay to unleavened beta I end up with an unlevered beta for being in casinos and on level beta for being in tobacco I come back to you and say well how much value did you get from each of these businesses and your reaction might be I don't know how much value I got but I can tell you how much revenues I got 70 from casinos 30 from tobacco you know what I'm going to do next I'm going to take a weighted average I now have an unleavened beta for your company then ask your final question do you have any debt because remember you can run a casino entirely Equity funded if you wanted to but if you say look I have a 60 debt to equity ratio I'm going to plug your company's debt to equity ratio and come up with the levered beta for your company why am I doing all of this because I don't like regression pages right but I got 100 Tobacco Company betas and casino betas from regressions so where's the big savings it's the advantage of using a hat remember that standardize yourself a GoPro if I have a hundred companies just like GoPro all with send there's a 0.5 horrifically bad baits and I take the average of those hundred betas you know what the standard error of the average is going to be I picked the sample size deliberately as a hundred it's called The Law of large numbers you take the typical standard at 0.5 you divide by the square root of the number of companies you have which is square root of 100 is 10. a hundred crappy betas and the average is magically precise I never got this in my statistics less how that you know what's happening though right when I say the standard error is high what am I saying some of these betas are overestimated some are underestimated by averaging I'm just get averaging out my mistakes the biggest plus of using bottom of betas is they're going to be far more precise even if you're in one business if you're still copied using an average of 100 Steel company pay this is a better base but you're saying how do I bring my company and a beta is not supposed to reflect company risk it's supposed to reflect exposure to macroeconomic conditions say what if my company is an Indian company that's not a beta problem that's a risk premium problem you're going to get a far more precise second if I entered the casino business yesterday there's no chance a regression beta can reflect it right but when I do a bottom-up beta not only can I reflect the weights of the businesses you're in today you plan to be in the fossil fuel business next year I can bring that into your weights I control the process now I'm not at the mercy of some Bloomberg beta page and finally we have to value a company that is a private company or a company that where you want to sell a division go to Bloomberg and look for as long as you want you would not have found a beta for Porsche the middle of last year why it is still a privately owned company but he's doing an IP you want to Value the IPO this gives you an opening for getting a beta for untreated companies private businesses divisions it expands your toolbox you're no longer at the mercy of can I get a regression can I get a regression beta and it forces you think about what I think are healthy things what businesses and how much risk are they exposed so I'll give you two quick examples you can see this process player it's a beta page that I use my corporate finance class A company that uses Vale they're in four businesses there are brazil-based mining company largest iron ore mining company in the world but they also have businesses metals and Mining fertilizers and Logistics so I broke them down into four businesses I went looking for publicly traded companies in each of these and I looked at Global averages why because these are all commodity companies you're not competing against other Brazilian companies you're competing against other mining companies elsewhere in the world and do I have the law of large numbers working for me it's the nice thing about having a global sample you can never tell me that you can't find enough companies I take the unleavened beta from those companies I do estimate the value of each business rather than just use the revenue weights part of the reason for that is you have high margin and low margin business is a dollar in Revenue one business can be worth a lot more than a dollar in Revenue in a different one and the way I capture it is with the multiple of revenues that companies remember when I got the betas from those publicly traded companies I looked up their Enterprise values and the revenues and computed a multiple of revenues you multiply what Wale gets its revenue from each business by that you get an estimated value I know this is a long way to what seems like something that you could look up on Bloomberg but those weighted the the weighted average that you get across those base 0.84 is my unleavid beta for y you're the center and that number is 0.02 why because I have such big samples that by the time I'm done I feel much more confident that I've actually got a beta that I can use and notice all the steps I skipped I didn't have to worry about doing a regression of Wale against above us Pub I don't care and that will save you more time than any time it takes you to actually compute a bottom-up air last step I brought in the debt to equity ratio in the case of Ali I gave it the same debt to equity ratio for the four divisions because they're all infrastructure heavily capped but if they had four very different businesses for Disney I'm going to give a very different beta for theme parks and for streaming I now have the capacity to compute a cost of equity and capital for every business separately it's a simple tool 50 years ago the data would have been the biggest impediment right how the heck am I going to look up betas for 25 companies for those of you who haven't signed up for s p Capital like you please do because if nothing else you can enjoy the power of having all that data on your fingertips for at least the next 15 weeks perhaps the rest of your MBA live but if you go to work somewhere you're going to get facts that are capital IQ and I'll give you if you if you if if you want their now online data services which for a hundred and hundred and fifty dollars a year you can pull up the betas for every chemical company in the world we're getting that the data is not the prompt it's whether you're willing to use it yes so basically each of the 48 companies is an Enterprise Value right just Market but each of the 48 companies is a revenue so I divide the Enterprise Value by revenue for each of the 48 companies I take the media across the companies you don't have to right what what do I need for the financial statements Revenue but Enterprise Value just is market value Equity plus debt minus cash so it's four four data items basically all of which are among the most observable you can only look up Yahoo finance you can pull up Enterprise value for pretty much every company so if you are wanting to do this by hand it'll probably take you 25 minutes it's not a huge amount of time because the date is all there yes but that's fine right I mean in a sense there is it's what the market is willing to pay for the revenue you're not saying it's the right price you're saying at least it's correlated with whatever the values of the market is overvaluing everything by 30 you're going to build it in it's true there are sectors that are being mispriced relative to others by using the price you have from you know the fix for that is right go to an intrinsic valuation of every one of the 638 companies not going there okay there's some things in valuation we've got to say look I'm going to do the best I can but beyond that it's going to take a reach that I'm not willing to do but the alternative is to just use revenues which is effectively saying the Enterprise Value to sales for every income every every company the word is it I would rather take Mis price EB to sales ratios and assume that every every business trades in the same multiple of revolution which is the alternate right because we don't do it yes it's always market value they oh I'll tell you upfront the only place in finance we use book values only place is in Computing accounting returns everywhere else in finance you always use market value Equity is easy that you cheat right what do investment Banks assume because they're too chicken to compute the market value of data they give up to is they assume book Debt is equal to Market debt so when you use the book Debt there it's not because you want to use book Debt because you're assuming book Debt is equal to Market debt I'll give you a way around that if that bothers you but everything is in market value touch if I'm doing 638 companies the answer is yes right but even there there's a quick and dirty way you can convert book Debt to Market debt but remember book Debt and Market debt are not going to be hugely different unless you've interest rates change in a dramatic way book equity and Market Equity is where the real fight is fun yes story course if you use Book value right yeah the market value you don't have to do any of that stuff because the market presumably is updating everything but if you use Book value oh you're talking about Book value of debt or Book value backward I never use Book value record it's it's not even sure debt you might use Book value because you can't compute market value debt might be banked that's the excuse investment Banks use for using book Debt is a lot of the debt is not traded it's not Bonds it's bagged debt therefore we're going to use book Debt Mark Equity you don't have that if it's a publicly traded company there is a market value no because otherwise as you said it's a it's a Pandora's box of adjusting then we will have to come back to that because then I don't think even that book value makes sense but since there's no market value left to come up with the solution that's one of the things we'll debate about hey what do you do at private companies when you don't have a market value this is one of those places we've got to make a judgment or an estimation call and I'll talk about what I do it's not perfect but I think it works reasonably well yes so for the data is all thousands thousands they were all weekly Davis and we remember when the law of large numbers is one of the most amazing things is if you take an average of weekly betas or monthly the thing if you take an individual company changing from weekly to monthly will sometimes raise the beta sometimes lower the beta could take averages across 500 companies you could try this if you want you do weekly betas you do monthly betas you do daily betas it's amazing the numbers all look roughly the same because as I said the the divergences average out this is why when you do it an individual company your choices matter great deal you say should I go back two years of five years should the daily or weekly or monthly because your choices make a difference if you're doing bottom-up betas to be sloppy it's going to be okay sloppiness Cuts both ways that's one of the reasons I like Baltimore betas is I don't want to end up in the in the in the thicket of it making those judgments on weekly or monthly daily I'm going to take whatever I'm given average things out and hope my mistakes average are but the default in Bloomberg is weekly I use S P Capital IQ for my betas because that's a raw database they give you a two-year beta five-year beta you know they give you like eight versions of betas I picked the two here because I get more companies in and then average out across companies and say please God let the mistakes happen John let's talk about another example and this is I think to open this door on because many people when they take this approach assume that you have to find companies in the same market doing the same thing to get a beta so I had to estimate a beta for embrar and Briar's Aerospace company there's the unleavened beta coming from looking at Global aerospace companies now if you go to Capital IQ you can actually start your screen by saying I want aerospace companies if you say look I want to stay Regional because it's a Brazilian Aerospace company I want to look for other Brazilian aerospace companies that's where I started I said find me as many Brazilian aerospace companies as you can a minute later s p Capital IQ came back with a sample size of one you know what the company it found was embryer this is not helping me replacing a Briar with them so I said let's make it Latin American Aerospace company spins again comes back with a sample size of one and Briar I said what the heck am I doing here why am I even focused on Brazilian or Latin America because when I take a short flight in the US the jet is either a Bombardier jet or a number agent this is a global aircraft manufacturing company I said why am I staying focused on Latin American companies I'm gonna look at aerospace companies globally not a huge sample even that right but I get at least some companies coming and this makes some people uncomfortable they say it's a Brazilian company how can you survey this for U.S companies or european companies here's the counter that I would offer and be willing to use this counter and anybody who asked this question what's the average paid across all U.S companies but it's not a trick question it's what what's the average beta Cross of all Brazilian companies one what's the average beta the nice thing about bait is a scaled round one so when I say the bait is 1.2 in the U.S and 1.2 in Brazil I'm just saying these stocks are 1.2 times more risky than the markets are you see the nice thing about betas because they're scaled to one I can take very risky markets it's not like debate is for very risky markets are high and the beta's very safe markets are low because they can't be they're scaled around one I could take the betas for Indonesian companies Indian companies European companies and put I can't do this with most other metrics I can't do it with price earnings ratios I can't do it with with numbers without but betas I should be and that's a good thing because imagine working for a Bolivian analyst and saying look I'm going to stay with us Bolivian companies to do my bottom-up Beta good luck with that because what is the law of large numbers required large numbers right sounds like an obvious thing you're not going to get large numbers in Bolivia or Portugal because these are tiny markets having this capacity to go Global means that you can never complain that you can't find enough companies and of course you'll always get somebody to say what if my company is a new company it's in a new business there are no new businesses there are new ways of delivering old businesses Uber did not invent car service it invented a new way of doing car service you think what about Facebook what business is Facebooking please don't say social media advertising you think Facebook invented advertising no it's been around for as long as people have been around when you want to make the argument that there's a new maybe they're more fixed cost different you want to adjust the advertising way to be my guest but this notion that somehow you have a company that's never been tried before is delusional because every company is in a business that's been around and there's betas from that business start with that number and adjust it for higher fixed costs or more discretionary but you can always find companies one final mechanical point I don't know how many of you worked in Europe or Latin America prior to come back coming back to school but in much of the world when people compute debt ratios they compute what's called a net debt ratio so let me draw a contracts gross that you take the total debt you divide by Equity you have a total debt ratio right in the case of embroidery that is almost 19 that's what I use to lever up the unlevered beta 1.07 but and Briar actually has more cash than that at the time that I did this if I computed a net debt ratio the net debt ratio would have been minus 3.32 percent don't try to fix the minuses I don't like minuses no this is if you do net debt ratios they can be negative apple has a negative net debt ratio what does that mean My Level bait is actually going to be lower than my unleaded beta Now by itself this looks momentous right back at 1.07 with one approach 0.93 part of you saying well one's going to give me a higher cost you're right a gross debt ratio approach will always give you a higher cost of equity than a net debt ratio approach but what's your cost of equity going into a cost to Capital calculation right to go from cost of equity to cost to Capital what do I do I take the cost of equity multiplied by the proportion of equity I take the cost to debt and multiply by the cost and cost that is much lower than the cost of equity so when I bring in debt into my calculation it usually brings the cost to Capital down and that's what happens when I use my gross debt ratio is now I'll bring in the 16 percent of embryo that comes from debt and I give it a much lower cost my cost of capital is going to come out if I use a net debt ratio though and I get to the cost of Capital Stage tell me what the cost to Capital calculation is going to look like for embryo you're going to have a cost of equity based on the net what's my equity ratio is going if it's based on net debt it's actually going to be greater than a hundred percent right so I'm going to because your net debt ratio is negative that must mean Equity so I'm going to be multiplying the cost of equity by a hundred and two percent and the cost of debt by minus two percent and guess what instead of pushing down my cost of capital it's going to put I'll end up with roughly the same cost to Capital either way my advice is make your choice if you want to do net debt new debt use net debt all the way lever on level do everything with net debt don't go back and forth if you want to use gross debt ratios stick with that all the way through you're going to be okay in either case but what you cannot do is go back and forth between those numbers so it took us a long time to get to this end page but we talked about three numbers right for the last three sessions risk-free rates Equity risk premiums betas each is trying to convey a singular message what is the risk-free rate convey it conveys what you can make on a guaranteed basis on your currency of choice that's what risk free rates are there for they're not there to show you how risky you are as a country or what business you're in risk it the equity risk agreement reflects where you do business not where you're Incorporated so all that game playing about coming up so the equity risk reflects your Geographic exposure and your beta reflects the kind of business you're in your Risky Business safe business and how much you've added to that risk by using debt what I think by keeping each item isolated you you end up not double counting that's why I made that big deal about adjusting Government Bond rates for default risk because otherwise what you called risk free and your Equity risk premium are going to be get pushed up by the same forces that's why I said when you get to debate I said don't have it I'm in a risky country I'm going to use a higher beta I've seen analysts do that this has nothing to do with country risk keep things isolated where they are and you're going to stay in control if not you can very quickly start to double count triple count quadruple card things you shouldn't be counting I think so I will see you on Zoom a week from today and um have a great presidency I'm sure you have a lot of things planned for President's Day it's kind of a useless holiday if you ask me but no it is what it is a Monday off so enjoy the long weekend it's a good time to catch up on your project so I expect to see the master list completed by Monday so go in and enter your company NeXT I just want to make sure I was understanding why it's important to uh just think through whether or not investors are Diversified is that because when you're looking at your new your new investment you're assuming that all the other investors your that investor is comparing against a good portfolio and so the overall portfolio matches what the market would would hopefully be its Diversified okay everybody thank you okay when you have a lot of companies and you're trying to average the betas yeah um is still each company individually should be then be regressed against their own index in large numbers but only if you assume okay because right now we're getting a message the only problem is um [Music] but not everyone against the s p they knew we would you would just be assuming that the s p is the average which is equity so the msci is about 60 because they have such instance in fact in many indices which are unlimited to see if you want to get a better day they're going to see yeah yeah I'm from Brazil it's an individual company this is why it takes so long two days of discussion which index should we use when doing two years and weekly or money and if you had just one company my advice would be a company five years it's Yahoo finance standards five years thank you because less and less as you go um so I always had a question about the backward living nature of betas um would it be like a advantageous to use like implied volatility or some other forward-looking measurement instead of beta Spirit um yeah but it's so backwards yeah will give you normalizing against the average uh okay so can you give you a measure there because there's nothing to do with it yeah thank you um we're talking about the the market value in the book value of 10. so what is the ideal way to be calculating it if you have time like all the data but do you want to use a market value plan because the company is still paying the coupon and everything on the face value right is wrong we still have the coupons in the face values yeah okay the only difference is we had discounted back yeah okay so when you don't market value debt it's not like they're assuming they were deployed because it's a little more rounder app so you think market value then it's always the right thing to do because you're not assuming that there was not a thing if this is assuming this is you bring down the Enterprise Value subscription right now I think we're overestimate the value for stress balance you take Bed Bath and Beyond yeah the way they can do that Enterprise yeah they subtract that cash yeah it looks too high yeah because you screwed up a bit this is a company where there's a 50 chance we will not get it if I could give you the market value of the debt I'm not telling you you're basically trying to capture the risk of the company right and then you're talking about the cost of capital that they have and through which is you know unless I mean it doesn't need to Market very dead it might not look like a 90 damage you know 60 percent and I think that's that's reality the real problems but continue to Define in this case it's not the debt that's people you know it's the fact that the Ascension of the business foreign okay but there's a higher failure between the DCF might have plantations you might never get to the university okay and the second is the cash flows might be under the village towards the cemented it's a cash flow problem is negatives so I understand that concept but I'm just thinking on the maths over here the cost of debt that you're taking and I get that the Enterprise Value should actually have the market value of that because it's kind of the market value of the operating assets but if you're just talking about the cost that the company is still having to pay on that face value the debt right they're not paying back on the market value yeah but that would be for any new debt that they should right it's not available you always have to ask if I were borrowing all of this and the answer for Bed Bath and Beyond knowledge so use market value there to shrink the number but you're not going to attach a cost of debt that reflects the fact that they see rated and they borrow money they're going to pay a default spread of 12 over them it's free but why is that for example if Bed Bath Beyond has let's say a term one for 10 years or 15 years and they have a fixed let's say Term Loan right and that's let's say is that by invested that money elsewhere what would I make today and the reality is on something like that that from Beyond you're not going to make the four percent you've been demanding a much higher rate the notion of cost of that is always forward look in another city because you're trying to measure the True Values the assets and even try to measure the riskings so because the mechanics of course it happens it's going to put this across dependent you know it's not a cost of price we're trying to get at risk well yeah okay for that for that first purpose which is really the only purpose in this kind of cash flow evaluation yeah existing assets because you'll be selling car I took five percent three years ago I'm gonna lock it in with my costume ball we're gonna end up with too low at this time so I think you reflect the reality because maybe that I mean evaluations you face all these challenges the first side looks like you're better than you're making a dead Creation with respect to practice but really risky so the overall cost of capital effect because I'm probably an independent higher positive character [Music] and that's not the issue okay it's really an issue of business is left it down they're not going to think of money you know generally possibility and best capture that okay and one impression because uh you're talking about the like tobacco companies or aerospace companies and you're calculating the unlevered beta for let's say 100 companies across the floor so when you're calculating those you're calculating level datas and then you're kind of going back to one level 47 000 companies oh okay so I'm using a service code which means I'm at the mercy of whatever it is because especially these large samples you don't get through Facebook that would matter that you do bed bath and be honest that's right for the usual book that and Mark it up astronomically either meditate to others it's going to push up the audience itself so use millions and then clean up the baby and get an unleavid but the promise is you're at the mercy with the services so I tell you what Captain like to use this is understanding for the U.S services it uses the European interest it doesn't use local indices so it actually does better than that is because these local indexes [Music] easier again Emerging Markets I think they have a problem I directly to them about this but they use this composite and emerging marketing that you can do and it has a path because what it does is it understates the values for immensely emergency the way you can tell us is I speak to the average aggression data that important for most Market companies started 2073 of course was 25 000 American Market there's a problem here so I actually do this second step then for those companies which is I try to adjust those betas to move them closer to one because there's something in the estimation process that's leading to a lot of very low datas and a few probably larger market cap Emerging Market companies probably had by Foreign institution investors having reasonable debate isn't everything that's just dropped through the floor okay so it is a problem with the service I know it is there but the fix for me is for just SMP Capital like two babies to make them at least follow the basics in a round one number but then I I go with those the perfect world you know what I'd like to stop the s p at 500 for us company in Europe because essentially I want a single scalar it's much more consistent than a product but no service that I know is the mscs so right now the comparing so when they're doing this regression they're doing it with individual NDC right they're not doing it with the same indexes they're using three different angles one two US company so then the betas are not really comparable right not really comparable in what sense the average Elite because these different indices also move differently right so you're comparing let's say European country with a European I mean let's say you took three rooms the first one is people second or the average weight into the third rooms you obviously can't put the weights across but what if I uh every person Every Woman divided by the average weight of the principle I'm going to get a relatively in person yeah so I said you know find me the people with the highest relative work one the person who you know weighed 1.5 pounds more than the average person the first room 1.5 that's basically what pages so if your objective is to get producing but there's still different ways that's what an equity risk premium so I multiply by the average width right so in a sense think of the equity risk premiums taking care of the differences across markets and betas is looking at relatively so we have a discretionary product and you are a picture of a high vatic interior activity we have a discretionary product in India should have a high beta against Indian index yeah but both betas are relative to one so but if you have like two different companies in two different geographies with let's say 1.2 beta they don't have the same they should say it right I mean but let's say one of these indices is actually filled with more companies with let's say fixed costs so they have to have let's say higher beta in general like operating level that's going to be more business the operating levels is uh is a multiplier no the underlying thing comes from discretion non-described so you'd have to find a product that is discretionary in one region and maybe Telecom service is the wrong time it's a good example of this non-discretion in the U.S and you're a discretionary in Emerging Markets there's an argument there for looking at data disability Market costs and the reason you're doing it is you have a product or service that you're building is discretionary in some markets not so make it about discretionary non-discretion rather than cost structure and that's why I report Phi Beta Federal program for U.S companies one for European companies Market companies and then I do it for you know regions we have enough companies like India and China because there will be cases we say an Indian retail company is really not like a retail company anywhere it was a regulatory restrictions and things like Ubuntu so I'm going to focus in on Regional betas for that greens and liquid but make it with the groceries the right reasons are the business itself it's changing together but very much to do with NBC okay by the time you get to these big indices um yes nothing about me just a mix of business it's pretty much acrossing thing to see aesthetic now you might have a little more Tech than us companies yeah but there's not no it's not like you know a 50 Steam that's the reason you want to avoid those really narrow indices kind of sort of yeah see that then you can get some real issues okay so I get that point but won't it be just easier to just have all of these companies getting regressed against just one index across the world yeah so using MSC ape nobody does no none of these Services [Music] complete they've lost the script no U.S investors have Global choices I mean I'm a choose to invest in U.S companies it's so it was leaving something as reasonable as the investment will do it again so it's just the fact what's invested there's an investment Finnish investors ahead that's what drives designers do think in terms of that's the best day and the only reason they go to the ADR and the fct driver is the local index is giving you a strange looking number this I don't like this number let me go try the S P 500 million years so there's no well-taught convenience for wireless the reality is data estimation started in English go by 40 years you only companies that are database communism borrowers one of the first disturbances are they took estimated against people it's only in the last 25 years companies and replicated on the local basis in every Market that's basically what the import rules look does even the adjustments you might want is a borrow itself which started in 1970s so I think there's no good reason for life Services doing what they do other than the fact that they would let the Legacy choice and so my favorite things in all the way that they now cannot get out so tomorrow they replace the local index the mscia I'll wage they will get tens of thousands of complaints from around the world saying you can't do this but the nice thing about Bloomberg is that really stupid change the internet yes or something in December for the msci to take EST you replace it with that and you know your currency issue it's a non-dollar company but you know that we can even adjust it because the only problem is doing it for myself with 47 000 properties that I think now we have this mess the thing in terms of how they regret to use what indices foreign leverage so he said you know the accounting doesn't report the expressive variable but then we can use the sales versus earnings like a degree of operating leverage yeah exactly right yeah so it's like a Leicester City kind of measure that works if you have a company with the wrong history without major Business Schools foreign [Music] yeah so for example the like Facebook advertising you said you know you might have to adjust for fixed variable costs so there you would say yeah [Music] almost all of the parts okay it's a profession is going to push your data up once you recognize that this is instead of actually more expensive businesses and that network is like in contrast you wouldn't have much lower than a much lower effects because he wants to see a little bit I think it's possible to 80 percent if you share the products with a lot of it is very easy so sometimes it's looking breaking down in businesses this so how is it going to affect the prices I mean when you are about doing the validation as you said on these years I mean we have to pay if you are investing 100 rupees you need to pay 20 off rent for the Indian government and then only you can make sure first off but if you look at the demographic the number of people who trade I mean invest in foreign [Music] they are not able to get this opportunity now so they have to invest in Indian stocks itself so the price again as you said will increase right yeah so how how can we uh okay yeah okay thank you the question is like definitely so like with China um statements the Top Line it's like cash received well operations is foreign capital a bit different come down 
last question before we start you can be on the recording I have one more are you reading any books do you have any books to recommend I don't read I think we are reading is vastly overrated to be quite honest we read too much we think too little and I that sounds like an extremely strange thing to say but you know we read we read blogs we read books we read papers we spend so much time reading what other people think that we've forgotten how to think on our own so I'd say read let's think more take those one hour breaks walk your dog if you have one steal somebody else's dog if you don't and as you go think about a question and say how would I answer it and it's actually a muscle like everything else the more you work on your own reasoning the better you'll get at it the professor I uh I take it an exception to the reading rule is your material right not necessarily even my material you could probably reason your way to an answer for this class you have no choice but to read some of this stuff but uh I would say you know there's nothing no rocket science nothing that I'm going to write that you can't think through your on your own no it'll be hubris on my part to think that somehow I have this special Insight that nobody else does because I don't yeah okay folks welcome it's time to begin a recording has started the slides are up so we're going to start with a very quick test on cash flows because today we're going to leave discount rates behind and start talking about cash flows and I can't wait because this is where evaluations are made or broken is an estimating cash flows now one of your tasks is to value a company right as it went May 8th 2023 let's be very specific I want the evaluation as of May 8th a pricing as of May 8th and a buy or sell as of May 8th isn't what are you talking about he'd be surprised at least about 10 percent of every class that I teach turn in valuations as of January 1st 2023 first if you do give me a valuation as of January 1st 2023 and you tell me to buy as of January 1st 2023. what the heck am I supposed to do with that you can't act on evaluation from a previous point in time because there's nothing I can do about it if you want to act it's got your valuations have to be current second do you know why I get that January 1st 2023 on on the valuation what is it about the evaluation that leads you to think I think in you know for all the wrong reasons the evaluation is of January 1st 2023. and how many of you have calendar year end annual reports many of you do right when you have a calendar year end annual report what is the the end date for the report it's December 31st of 2022. so people think if I'm using December 31st or 2022 numbers I must be valuing the company as of January 1st 2023. no you're not why not on January 1st 2023 would you have had access to Tesla's December 31st 2022 report no in fact it wasn't until February that that report came out so today the first question I'm going to ask you is a very simple one if your job is to work come up with an updated valuation you want to order your numbers to be updated right now some of your numbers are Market numbers they get updated automatically like what the t-bond rate I mean I hope that you use a t-bond rate that's closer to me that you're not using a January 1st 2023 t-bond rate when you value your company I'm going to update my Equity risk for instance start of every month you might not have the time to do the May 1st update but hopefully at least you'll lose the April 1st update of the equity risk premium as your Equity risk premium but you're going to run into a prom with accounting numbers some of you might get lucky which is your accounting numbers will reflect the most recent annual report and the most recent annual report might be the one that came out no the the most free the it's the latest report that's come out but if you try to value your companies today and some of you should try sending that Excel spreadsheet and you're looking for updated numbers to use from a from an accounting perspective many of you still have 10ks as of December 31st of 2021 especially outside the U.S because people don't update that quickly many of you are still working with annual reports that are actually December 31st 2021. so value for the company might say that's my last annual report I can I'm going to use that so that's your first option the second is you might have had a quarterly report come out as of September 30th of 2022. even though you don't have the full year you could take that last quarter that you got and multiply by four as I go through this list tell me what think about what you would do and what you would not do you know so take a quarter and Report multiply by four the third choice is to add up the last four quarters of numbers that you have for your company it's called a trailing 12 month number it's easy to do and come up with a trailing 12 month number the fourth choice is to take let's say you have the first three quarters of 2022r but you don't have the last quarter is to fill in the Gap by looking at estimates for the fourth quarter so here's my question if you're doing an updated valuation of your company today and your 2022 annual report is not out yet would use the 2021 annual report would you take the last quarter which would be the third quarter 2020 to a multiply by four would you take a trailing 12 month number or create your own 2022 by taking the first three quarters of 2022 in the fourth quarter from an estimate anybody want to give that a shot take the one choice that I shouldn't shouldn't even be on the table which of those four choices is a non-starter so Professor option A should not should be non-starter option A shouldn't be a non-starter why uh we are talking about report that is almost it's old right your value in the Solar tech company I wage at the 2021 report is going to be ancient history and the old the younger the company the more you worry about it so yeah B should be off the table as well because what does that mean that you're traveling because court is a heterogeneous you have you know Christmas sales holiday sales Humanity right you can't multiply that by four you take a retail company you take the third quarter and multiply by four you routinely going to underestimate revenues because their biggest quarter is the last quarter of every year and you're not including it so option b is off the table but narrowing it down right so you're stuck between trailing 12 months and the last choice the problem with the last choice is you might be able to get analyst estimates for revenues maybe even earnings for a company for the fourth quarter but you're not going to be able to fill in the rest of the details you can't get capex and Acquisitions and depreciation and working capital so it's often most by default we end up with trailing 12-month numbers so if today you value a company the last annual report is still 2021 use trailing 12 month numbers but leave the door open forward hopefully sometime between now and April your company's fourth quarter number should roll in be ready to update your numbers you're saying won't that be a lot of work not really just updating numbers and evaluation don't wait till April to value your company value company today and update the numbers it's easy to fix So today we're going to talk about updating why it's so critical and why I mean people get caught up in consistency issues they're saying but the annual report is as of December 31st how come we're using the t-bond rate as of May 9th or May 8th you're being consistent you know how you're being consistent using the most updated numbers you can for every single input you can find it's not your fault that accountants don't update numbers every every two minutes or every day second today in the context of talking about cash flows we're going to talk about capex now I want you to think back to your accounting class right yeah accounting class you ran into capex or if you're an accountant you are under capex multiple times over your life in which financial statement do you usually report capex is an accountant income statement balance sheet statement of cash flows another statement s should be the statement of cash flows you can indirectly maybe get it out of the balance sheet but it's usually in the statement of cash flows and I remember what my accounting professor told me about what should go into capex I'll repeat what he said and then I'll question whether accountants are staying true to their own definition of capex my accounting professor who taught us is Accounting 101 said at capex is any expenditure that creates benefits over many years let me repeat that again capex is any expenditure that creates benefits of it as opposed to an operating expense labor materials where it creates revenues this year so I want you to hold on to that definition I'm going to list out a bunch of items and you tell me whether they passed the capex test using that broad definition and whether they pass the accounting test and actually show up as capex in the state and the cash flows building a manufacturing plant does it also show up as capex on the statement of cash flows yes so on manufacturing companies accountants do fine how about r d expenses for a technology company first is it a capex if you define it as an expense over that you expect to get benefits over many years yes yeah should be it might be uncertain you can argue I don't know but so uncertainty is not a dividing line on capex versus non-capex r d is super capex but is it show up as capex and a statement of cash flows definitely come to screw it up big time so today we're going to talk about r d and what to do about it but I'm not done let's say your consumer product company whose biggest value comes from your brand name a Coca-Cola is some of your advertising to build up branding it's not just get you to buy more coke it's to build a brand name right is that brand name advertising capex if you define capex as benefits over many years yeah that's so but here again accountants read all advertising is an expense what if you're a consulting firm think about your biggest ass human capital right what you spend on recruiting and training those Consultants is your version of capex but guess what accountants do the expense it we have a full-fledged accounting and consistency problem on our hands because accounting as we know it was designed for the old-time manufacturing firm and it's being stretched to the Limit and broken as the bulk of the world shifts away from manufacturing take a look at the 20 largest market cap companies in the world I don't think there's a single Manufacturing Company not one on that list technology pharmaceutical firms Financial Service firms so today I want to come back and talk about what do we do about this accounting and consistency because it is screwing up valuations around the world to follow the accounting statements and assume that what you see reported as capex is actually the capex for a company so I am going to stop the share and reshares I'm sorry I like doing the dance here so now we're back on the slides let's go back to where we left dove ah shoot sorry about that you can see the slides right but I can't see the slides so let me go back because if I do it on it's it's taken over both my displays and I don't like that foreign so where we left off you guys can see the discount rate slide right so so where we left off last session was talking about the cost of equity and the cost of equity is the function of the risk-free rate the bait and the equity risk premium it measures what Equity investors in your company demand is a return for investing in your equity but Equity is only one way you can raise capital what's the other you can go out and borrow money you can issue bonds it's debt right so today I want to nail it on two questions one is what is the cost of debt and the second is what should we be including in debt when we do Costa Capital let's start with the first question to estimate the cost of debt I'm going to lay out the ground rules again what we're trying to estimate is essentially the cost of borrowing long term today to a company let me repeat that again the cost of debt is the rate at which a company can borrow long term today two key words one is long term why do I throw that in there it's not true right now but in most years when you look at the term structure short-term rates versus long-term rates what does the term structure look like in most typical years in most normal years short-term rates are lower than long-term rates all right they generally tend to be lower right if I measure the cost of debt based on the maturity of the debt you use as a company you're going to play games with me you know how you're going to play games to make your cost of capital lower you're going to take on one year loans rather than 10-year loans and say look my cost of debt is only two percent and I'm gonna say no I'm not going to give you that benefit because at the end of the year you've got to roll over that debt into a new one-year debt so rather than treat you as having one year debt I'm going to give you a 10-year cost of debt even though you're one year debt makes your life a lot simpler because it means you don't have to figure out the tenor of the maturity of the debt the company has you just have to think about if they were borrowing long term today what rate would they pay the second word was today I don't care what Reiki board at two years ago for don't even show me your books don't show me your existing bank loans don't show me existing bond coupon rates because if you're borrowing today here's how I'm going to compute the cost of debt since the long-term cost today I'm going to start with the long-term risk-free rate and add to that at default spread what's the default spread it's a spread that lenders are going to charge you because of how much they wired that you might not pay how the heck am I going to get a default spread some companies there is a service out there or an entity there are entities out there that make your life easier right rather than you have to estimate the default risk they estimate it for you what am I talking about you're trying to get a cost to debt for a company what's an easy fallback if you don't want to do make the Judgment of how much default risk is there rating companies you look at Moody's or SNP of fetch they rate your company of course you're taking the risk that they might screw up but think of how much easier it is to look up the rating double a single B Triple B you're saying how does that help me if you can give me a rating for your company I can tell you what default spread goes with that rating I can update that rating and I'll give you ways of doing it you can get the most updated spreads for your company so if you have a rating for a company you can use the default spread base in the ready in some cases you'll actually find that your company has bonds outstanding and you might think that you've got an easy way out to get a cost of debt because there were bonds that are traded you can get the yield to maturity in a bond that's a current updated interest rate in the bond and you're going to be tempted to use it as a cost of debt but before you do that I want you to think about the answer to a question can a risky company issue a safe Bond yes they can and what would they need to do to make that Bond safe issue more um higher in the capital structure more um in other words the safest assets the best cash flows to back up the bonds and I can borrow at a lower rate than the rate for the company right so what I'm trying to say is you can have a company that is risky issue bonds that are safer because they've carved out the safest assets of the company and your job is to assess the cost of debt for the company not the bond this is why Moody is actually an s p rape companies but they also rate bonds most of the time the tool converge but you can actually have a double layer or a single iterated company issue a double a rated Bond on a specific segment of the company so if you find a bond don't get too excited the nice thing about having a bond is there's a rating that goes with it you can use the rating to come up with the default spread you're saying what if I have a company that doesn't have a rating for those of you who were in my corporate finance class I offer a way to get because remember 80 percent of all companies on the face of the Earth don't have a rating especially if you go outside the U.S small companies Emerging Market companies you can look up Moody's in s p but there's no rating for a company it's getting better but you still have a big segment of companies that don't have a ratings so what do I do with these companies act like a ratings agency give them a rating it sounds incredibly complicated but Radix agencies are in many ways the most transparent organizations in the world you know why because they tell you what the rating of every company their rate is it's public information they also give away the store they tell you the eight ratios they claim to use to come up with the rating Moody's and s p used to have that in their front page these are the eight Racers ebitdata fixed charges debt to Capital so basically celebrations so about 30 years ago I said I want to think like a ratings agency so I went and downloaded the eight ratios for every rated company I downloaded the rating for every rated company and then I did some reverse engineering you know what I mean by reverse engineering I sorted the companies based on ratings and let me try to figure out why Triple A rated companies are AAA rated looking at the ratios and here's what I found I found that one of the eight ratios was carrying the bulk of the load of explaining the rate it was the interest coverage ratio interest coverage ratio for those of you who forgotten your accounting is this earnings before interest in taxes divided by interest expense so if you look at embryo for instance I took the earnings before interesting tax I had normalized the numbers because they jumped around I looked the average divide by interest expense I come up with 3.56 what does that tell me for every dollar of Interest expenses they have 3.56 in operating in come away as a lender you want this number to be a high number or a low number what makes you feel you want it to be as high as possible Right you feel safer I compute so basically I looked at so I did basic statistics what explains the ratings of Interest coverage ratio and it created what's called a lookup table based on how ratings agencies rated companies simply put here's what a lookup table allows you to do you give me an interest conversation in the case of embroidery 3.56 I go look to see where it falls in the lookup table it's between 3 and 4.25 I assign a rating based on that a minus and I say if I were rating your company I would expect to see an A minus rating I update this lookup table on my website every year so basically if you don't have a rating for your company and this is a nice thing you have a private company you can still compute an interest coverage ratio go to the table use the table to go you're saying why are there two columns one is for larger companies and one is for smaller companies life isn't fair and larger and smaller years based on market cap it's a five billion dollar market cap and or a higher is larger it turns out if you're a smaller company you need a much higher interest coverage ratio to get the same rating so in this case with embryo the rating that I got from embryo was a minus based on their interest coverage ratio you think do I have to do this if I operating not necessarily but I actually do this just to check my rating to make sure that the ratings agency is not screwed up big time it's a good idea to actually it's called a this is called a synthetic rating because you're Computing the rating on your own essentially you're coming up with the rating based on the interest coverage ratio then we complete the story from Briar at the time that I did this I was doing my evaluation of embryo in U.S dollar terms it's 2004. the risk-free rate in US Dollars the t-bond rate was 4.29 now based on my rating for embryer the rating I gave them was a minus and the default spread is one percent now this were a U.S company I'm done I take the risk-free rate I add the default spread and I walk away 5.29 percent but this is a Brazilian company you're saying so what when you're a company in Brazil and you go to the bank to borrow you carry two burdens on your shoulder one is your company's default risk right and the spread that goes with it and the other is and this is the unfair part is the country's default risk do you think that's so unfair talk to some Greek companies about how unfair life has been for the last 15 years you're a Greek company try to borrow money you walk into a bank because I'm a great company the banker says that'll be a 15 interest rate they haven't even looked at my financials so here's what I have to do I have to bring in country risk into my cost of debt and the way I do this is I take the default spread for Brazil and most companies I just add the entire default spread for the country to the cost of debt because unlike Equity you kind of Base Indian companies even if they get their revenues outside India often are fully exposed to Indian countries in terms of cost of debt but in some cases like as in embryo they have so much exposure outside the domestic Market that they're able to be safer than the government for a long time petrobras and Breyer were able to borrow money in dollar terms at a rate lower than the Brazilian government because lenders felt more comfortable lending to them so here's what I have is my cost of that t-bond rate risk free rate plus one percent that's a company default spread plus a portion of my country default spread giving me a dollar cost of debt of 9.29 percent that's my pre-tax cost of debt for a Brian U.S dollar terms and I got there using the rates now this table lookup table I'll make a confession 30 years ago when I did it was almost all U.S companies because only U.S companies had ratings very few European companies were rated I mean things have changed today the table can be much richer because you have more companies rated around the world but I often use this ratings lookup table in countries like Indonesia or India or Brazil and people say but can you do that is that okay and I'll give you a qualified answer it's okay as long as you're looking at risk-free rates that are not wildly different from the dollar was created the reason that matters if you are in a country where the risk-free rate itself is 15 guess what you're not going to get interest coverage ratios of 8.5 and higher because even with a tiny amount of debt your interest expenses explore so if you're in a market with very high risk free rates and you work in a currency that's very that is a very high risk free rate maybe this table won't work that well but in most other cases it travels fairly well so once you get the rating you get a default spread right that default spread and I'm stating the obvious here is not a constant it changes over time but it's stake 2022 it was a momentous year not just for what happened to the t-bond rate but what happened to default spreads so what you have in this graph is the default spread on seven different ratings classes AAA double a single a triple B Double B single B and what's what is what it says zero is Triple C and below so the last column is high yield bonds so you look at the very first row that was the spread at the start of the year so let's say AAA the default spread at the start of the year was 0.51 percent by the time you get to September of 2022 which is the bulk of the movement in 2022. that default spread had widened to 0.65 percent it's about a 0.14 increase if you take a triple B the default spreads start 1.21 percent by September that spread was up to 1.87 and if you take high yield bonds 6.78 it'll become notice something that spreads effect is getting larger with high U bonds and width that invest in grade bonds and higher with investment grade bonds and with Triple A bonds last year if you remember Equity risk premiums exploded out of the box and you saw that graph the same thing happened in default spreads so even if your rating did not change through 2022 your cost of debt changed dramatically right because the risk-free rate went up and your default spread for the same rating went up which is a kind of a wake-up call of you don't say frozen spreads that are two three four years old try to get updated spreads and I'll give you a couple of sources that I use to get updated prints that are free that's a big no big thing for me is I look for only free sources I'm not paying somebody 500 a week a month to update it I'm not I can't pass this on to somebody so give me a couple of great sites we can update the spreads but a point about you know kind of keeping spreads update so January 2023 this is what the default spreads look like from AAA all the way down to D so if you give me a rating for your company or a synthetic or an actual rating that's a default spread I would use but I keep checking those default spreads to see whether they change during the course of 2023 because who knows what this year will bring so any questions about ratings and default spreads yeah Professor um one question when you consider the table for the synthetic uh cost of debt we're obviously considering that the company hasn't defaulted it's that in its history right because that's apparently right why does it matter that they've defaulted well because because a company that restructures their debt might have a better interest uh ratio that's perfectly okay you're lending to the restructured company not to The Old Company is an updated cost of debt today right so you can have a company that are in bankrupt every airline has gone bankrupt at some point in time in its history right but not led to United today or American today of Southwest today what I care about is what does it look like today is your question about the interest conversation not reflecting the restructuring because it's restructure the interest coverage ratio should reflect that as well right but but do rating agencies take the same approach in terms of look at the airline ratings if history I mean do they consider history yes but if you have great interest coverage ratio as an airline you're going to get a good rating notwithstanding your history if you're permanently tainted as a company once you go bankrupt you'd never be able to borrow money as an airline it's the restructuring chain I mean you're lending to a very different company if it's restructured so companies history is not going to be the key factor in whether you're lending you might you know you might play a role in credibility of the company and the business it's in but you're lending to the restructured company not to The Old Company Nabisco when you know defaulted on its dead came back with a new company new rating an entirely different game so let's talk yeah another question here you mentioned companies outside the U.S get a portion of country defaults countries let's do the entire one don't even do a portion because you have an Indian company so basically we're building up to a cost to that start with a risk-free rate in rupees add the default spread for the company and add the default spread for the country and in straight in a strange way you just reversing what you did to get to the risk-free rate right because the government bond rate included the spread so in a sense what you're doing is you're taking the government bond rate and adding the default spread for the company to it by doing it but I you know it's it is part of part of life is when you borrow money you are afflicted but I mean can you you know I feel sorry for that poor Venezuelan company that's still trying to borrow money you had two-thirds in here yeah that sort of arbitrary is that what you like it's like a Lambda it's you know I don't even try to do it anymore because it's just so messy to do I actually in 2003 found companies like embryer and looked at the actual cost of debt relative to to Brazil but it's so much work to do and so tedious I've stopped doing it I just add the entire default spread for the country now okay thank you foreign I wanted to know if it matters uh what currency the debt is in let's say you know you're an Indian company free rate matters right if your default spread is three percent and your risk-free rate is two percent and you're now moving to a risk-free rate of 20 from two percent obviously you're going to charge a much higher default spread than three percent right so if you are actually worried about the level of the risk-free rate being very different one simple adjustment is to take the default spread you get from this table which is a dollar default spread and scale it up it's inflate the same inflation effect we talked about what the risk rates is adjust the spreads for the same inflation effect which is if your inflation is 15 minus three percent take you know the default spread multiply by 1.15 divided by 1.03 it'll scale up all the spreads so the much higher risk rate or do your entire analysis in dollars and then do the the inflation adjustment on that that will adjust everything risk premiums and default spreads for the much higher level of rates um if uh yeah so if a company is say an Indian company is Raising debt from an Indian Financial pressure company they still need to incorporate the company is my default spreads and so if the question was India has a ratings agency called Crystal which has been around it's well regarded but it rates only Indian companies AAA from Crystal basically means relative to other Indian companies this is an extremely Safe Company so using Crystal ratings you're actually getting a company default spread that is india-specific you'd have to look up the defaults you can't take my my double A spreads and apply to a crystal double A it doesn't work so unfortunately I don't maintain those spreads I don't have the data to do it so if you want to use an Indian ratings agency as your basis then you're on your own in terms of coming up with default spreads based on that because I don't I don't have a lookup table for that unfortunately it's not difficult though go find other companies with similar Crystal ratings see what their what what the rates on their bonds are and see if you can back into a default spread Vicky uh hi professor um it's also about the two-thirds um so right now if I was I were calculating the cost of that do I just add the country default just add the entire country and the company just add those kind of companies as well so basically add the country and the company and that's the default built into the fcff ginzu simple spreadsheet that I sent you because you picked the country and I automatically look up the default spread and add it on so it's happening already in the background it using synthetic Ray from there okay got it thank you okay so let's go back to the cost today so cost to debt is the rate at which you can borrow money long term today based on your credit risk right but let's say your company has access to subsidized debt you know why would somebody lend me money at a rate below the market rate sometimes governments do that right because I want to encourage a certain export business is green energy I want to ask a question about what to do when you have subsidized it and I'm going to use embroider as my example if you remember the cost of debt that embryo should be paying given their risk is 9.29 on on the dollar debt embryo was actually being lent money by the Brazilian government at a six percent dollar cost of that it was subsidized why because Brazil was proud about the fact that an aerospace company and they wanted to get the so my question is a very pragmatic one when you compute cost to capital for embryer let's assume all their debt is subsidized it was but let's assume it was all subsidized should I use the six percent subsidized cost of debt is my cost of debt in which case my cost of capital will be much lower should I use the 9.29 cost of debt as my cost of debt the market rate which would make my costly Capital higher or is there some solution in the middle that you would pick for the company I'd go for B you'd pick B and then what about the subsidy then because it does there is a real benefit you're getting right I would pick b as well but I can't ignore the subsidy is there a way you can value the subsidy is it not the isn't the cost of debt the opportunity cost and so we're going to use the market rate I I agree with the rationale for using B but I'm saying notwithstanding that there is still this for the value the company is being pushed up because they are giving given subsidized debt right reflecting your cash flows in some way and interesting there's an easier way to do it right if you take this bond which has a six percent rate but let's take the debt at six percent red right their true market rate is 9.29 so if you take the debt and you revalue it using a 9.29 you're going to get a much lower value for the debt that difference is effectively the subsidy the Brazilian government is subsidizing You by 320 Million by giving you debt on which they should have paid only 680 million they paid they've actually paid a billing so and that's the reason I think it's a better solution than building the six percent into your cost of capital is because you're right you're violating a basic rule which is this is not the rate you can borrow money at outside and second you're running the risk of locking it in Forever it would and the danger there is subsidies end at some point in time so I think that the right solution is to continue to use the 9.29 percent yeah and take the subsidy as the absolute amount and just change yeah that's right valuation it's cleaner it's a much cleaner way to deal with subsidies in fact in general any kind of subsidy you get from the government it's better to keep it out of the valuation value it separately so you know how much of your values coming to that subsidy and how much will disappear the minute the subsidies taken away a lot of the order companies now for the next few years are going to get a subsidy from the federal government right because every time you buy an electric car you know I don't know how the the end law turned out originally was going to be it was made in the U.S and electric car made in the U.S there are those subsidies add to your value as an order company question is how much do they add and what effect will it have on your value foreign cash flows no not really right what cash flows do we discount with the cost of capital pre-debt cash flows if you're doing free cash flow to equity we wouldn't be doing cost to Capital in the first place then you're right that lower interest expense would push up your net income but because you're looking at operating into a free cash flow to the firm that subsidy is not shown up in your cash flows yet but that's a good question to ask have I already counted that in my cash flows and if you're doing Equity valuation you probably have counted it in by pushing up your net income with the lower interest expense let's talk about the last piece the cost to capitalize what weight should I use I'll give you the choices you probably already know the right choice but then I'm going to put you on the spot and ask you to justify what every Corporate Finance textbook as you do it as religion so here are the choices first is you could use Book value rates Book value of equity Book value of debt it's right there right shareholders equities Book value of equity the second is you can use market value rates market value Equity market value of debt but does every Finance textbook suggest you should use this weights when you do cost your Capital Book value market value Book value and I I want to make sure that you burnt to the ground because it definitely it's market value it's always market value weights so I want to ask you a question of why we push that because it seems like religion people talk about it and you ask them why do you use market value way they don't seem to have a good reason so let's see if you can give me the reason is it because the market is usually right the danger of opening that door if you say the market is right that's why I'm using market value rates tell me what you're doing with the cost of capital you're using it to value your company come up with a value per share which you're comparing to the market price and telling me the market is wrong and I'm going to come back and say but he told me the market is usually right don't put yourself in this part of having to justify the market being right it's not that could it be that market values are easy to get book values are just as easy right they're both easy to get is it because book values of equity and debt are meaningless if you truly hate accountants you'd buy into that statement even I don't buy into the statement they're not quite meaningless they're meaningful we can debate how meaningful you want to know the real reason we use Market valuates it's because every discounted cash flow evaluation is an exercise an acquisition valuation you're acting like you're buying the entire company in the market today so tell me what you'd have to pay for shares you'd have to pay the market price not your estimated intrinsic value not book value if you wanted to buy out all the debt you'd have to pay market value this is a transaction driven view that's what drives cost to Capital market value rates are driven not by the perception the market is right that's why we can get away with the inconsistency of using market value rates to get a cost to Capital and end the valuation by saying I got an intrinsic value per share that's higher than the price per share so file that away if somebody asks why do we use market value rates don't dance around don't talk about market efficiency don't tell me the market is right it's really about what you're trying to do in a discounted cash flow evaluation it was a long journey we're at the destination I want to compute a cost of capital for embryo which I've done in bits and pieces to the last hundred pages start with the cost of equity first I'm going to do everything in US Dollars I made the choice because in 2004 there were no Brazilian government REI bonds I didn't even have a choice of doing a nominal re-evaluation so my risk-free rate was a t-bond rate 4.29 then to get my cost of equity I got a beta and that was a bottom-up beta for embryo based on global aerospace companies multiplied by a mature Market premium and then brought in the country risk through a Lambda and a country risk premium and of course if I wanted to do this in one step I could have done a weighted average Equity risk spring cost of equity of 10.7 percent cost of debt we just went through t-bond rate plus default spread for the country four percent plus default spread for the company one percent nine point two nine percent market value of equity share price times number of shares was easy market value of debt is really is often very difficult to get directly you know why because much of debt is not traded it's Bank debt even companies that issue bonds will often have debt that's not traded it's an invest Banks you know what the what the rule is right because debt is so difficult to get a market value for you'll often see people use Book value of debt as a proxy for market value and say it won't be that different and 95 percent of the time you're going to be okay until you run into a Bed Bath and Beyond and what's the market value of debt at Bed Bath and Beyond going to look like Relic for the book value of that much lower or much higher much lower right the book value debt reflects what they're expecting to pay but because you're in so much risk you're not sure you're going to see a market discount so here's what I'm going to do to convert Book value debt to market value it's a neat little trick find it away even if you don't use it sometimes you'll find it useful the book value of debt at embryer is 1.953 billion that came off the balance sheet their interest expense came off the income statements 222 million the maturity of the debt which came from the footnotes was four years so here's what I know I know the book value of debt is 1953 million I know the interest expense is 222 million I know the debt comes due on average in four years and I also know what the current market interest rate for debt should be based on my pre-tax cost to debt calculation 9.29 percent I treated the debt on the books as if it were a gigantic coupon Bond so hang in there with me how do you value coupon Bond you take the present value the coupons and then you add the present value the face value the coupons here are 222 million a year I take the present value of a coupon every of four years at 9.29 so then you calculate you're entering 929 as your payment n is four years discount rate is 9.29 you hit the present value you're going to get a present value of nine 222 million for four years the 1953 million is like the face value of the bond it's coming in at the end of the fourth year I discounted back four years at 9.29 I add the two numbers up I've converted my book Debt a 1953 million to market value debt of 2083 million I'm home free I've got an equity value and a debt value I take a weighted average the weights turn out to be that equity and debt value right 84 Equity 16 debt my cost of equity is 10.7 percent my pre-tax cost to debt is 9.29 percent which I then proceed to multiply by 1 minus a tax rate plus why am I doing this again why you know with Equity I don't seem to be multiple why am I multiplying my cost to debt by one minus the tax rate Ed is it paid pre-tax because 9.29 is what I pay pre-tax and what is the tax score in much of the world allow me to do um so give your tax shield right okay the interest expense is a tax deduction right I'm I'm reflecting that Equity it's it's extremely unfair because if I have to pay Equity investors it's got to come out of after tax cash flows but with that it's almost like the government bends over back with saying borrow more money which then leaves me with the pragmatic question of hey what tax rate should I use using what do you mean what tax rate you have a choice of two tax rates one is what's called an effective tax rate anybody want to just Define for me what an effective tax rate is Meredith what's an effective tax rate is it not just the interest expense or sorry the tax who you currently pay on your earnings each year it's if you go to the income statement the accrual income statement there's a tax line item and a taxable income line item it's taxable tax it's accrual taxes divided by a cruel taxable income basically it's if do any of you use um you know Turbo Tax or a tax software to do your software taxes every year I do I've done it for a long time and it always pisses me off after I've gone through and input the numbers at the very end here's what TurboTax will come in and say congratulations you're done with your taxes this year you paid 27.83 percent of air just gross income in taxes and what they do is they take a total taxes paid divide by the adjusted gross income which is my version of taxable income and report a tax rate that's like an effective tax rate companies do that all the time they take taxes paid divided by taxable income think of it as an average tax rate across all your incomes what's a marginal tax rate the key word is marginal so what is the word marginal indicate Daniel want to give that a shot what does a marginal tax rate it's the tax paid on the last dollar of earnings you made not tax paid in the last dollar and where would I get that let's say you're in the US you're a U.S company the tax rate up paying the last dollar up on my income I'm going to start with the federal tax code right what's the federal tax rate on corporate income 21 21 it used to be 30 it used to be 35 one of the highest tax rates in the world it's now 21 am I home free as a company I pay federal taxes but the U.S actually has this three-tier tax system right states often have corporate taxes well depending on which state you're in California is a state corporate tax and sometimes you can have local corporate taxes you're in La you can have a local corporate tax in the USB ad state and local to the federal you end up with about 25 percent that number can be closer to 21 if your taxes base near very low corporate taxes it can be is 27 in New York and California but it's about 25 percent the average effective tax rate for U.S companies last year was about 18 percent so the question I'm asking would the cost of debt is which of those two tax rates should I use to get the after tax cost to debt should I go with the effective tax rate which is going to be 16 17 18 or even as low as 9 for some companies or should I go with the marginal tax rate I think margin effective I heard one effective one marginal so I'm going to give each of you a chance to explain your answer so let's start with the marginal tax rate person give me the reason for using a marginal tax rate I couldn't tell who it was yeah so it was me so I think it's marginal because you if you think if there is no debt versus there is debt you are paying the marginal marginal tax on these on the idea you are saving the marginal tax on the uh interest basically so again let me use TurboTax to illustrate the point let's suppose you have a million dollars in taxable income if I'm insulting you add an extra zero make it 10 million if that makes you feel better it's you have a hundred thousand dollars in interest expenses so tell me what happens you take the million you subtract out the hundred thousand you report nine hundred thousand dollars in taxable income right so think of where you saved on taxes you didn't save on the first hundred thousand you can serve in the middle hundred thousand is saved on the last hundred thousand interest saves you taxes at the margin and I'll give you a very practical example to illustrate this Apple's effective tax rate last year was about fifteen percent you know why it's so low it's because you have income from other parts of the world where taxes are much lower than the US 10 tax rate countries fifteen percent when I compute Apple's after tax cost today they have about 100 billion in debt I used the U.S tax rate of 25 percent and here's why in spite of the fact that Apple has operations all over the world guess where they borrow money they borrow money in the US because they don't borrow money in Ireland for their Irish sub they borrow money in the U.S it doesn't make sense for companies to borrow money in low tax locales it's a choice so I'm going to go with the marginal tax rate even if your effective tax rate is low because I know you're going to find a way to get the maximum tax benefit on your interest expense let the cynic in you come on because if the cynical part of you says hey these guys can figure out a way to maximize tax but you're right that's exactly what happens the bottom line here is my caustic capital for embryo in U.S dollar terms is 9.97 percent and it's 2004. you computed this cost of capital you're feeling pretty good right you're done two weeks later you decide you made the wrong choice you know what I mean by the wrong choice you should really have been writing this company in realize not in dollars and you say what was I thinking I should have done everything in realize sounds like you have to start from scratch right so I'm going to give you a quick and dirty way in which you can go from a US dollar cost to Capital to a real cost of capital and this is actually going to be in response to anurag's earlier point about default spreads and what if you have a risk-free rate that's very different do everything in US dollars in this case 9.97 then look up two numbers one is the expected inflation rate in Brazil and the other is the expected inflation rate in the U.S it's the same same differential inflation we talked about in the context of risk free rates what that will do is almost instantaneously convert your dollar cost to Capital of 9.97 into a nominal re-i-costic capital of 16.44 percent it's an incredibly useful trick to have in your back pocket because it basically means that if you have a cost of capital in any currency and you're talking to a client you're talking to a colleague who thinks in a different currency they think in rupees you're thinking in dollars you can both start talking apples to apples if you convert your dollar cost to Capital into rupee cost to Capital and all it needs is bringing inflation into play one final point and this is something that some of you will run into and my cost of capital notice there were only two components debt and equity and I tried really hard to make sure there are only two components but sometimes companies can throw curveballs at you and by cobos I'm talking about what are called hybrids you know what a hybrid is it's part that part equity and it's In One Security I'll give you two examples of hybrids one are convertible bonds somebody explained to me what how a convertible Bond Works Jackie how does a convertible Bond work a convertible Bond um means that you convert it into Equity you don't have the radio you don't have option to convert equity and when would you exercise the option when stock prices are soaring when stock prices are dropping when stock prices are soaring in other words it's a conversion option that becomes very valuable if your stock price keeps rising at some point you say I'm going to become one of those guys and you convert your Bonds in that way a convertible bond is two pieces to it a straight Bond because as long as you hold it as a bond you get coupons like any other Bond you get face value so you have the choice of leaving your convertible Bond as a bond collecting coupons and face fat that's a straight Point portion and you've got this conversion option which is really equity so I'm going to talk about hey what do we do with convertible bonds the other and this is the more messy hybrid and thank God most sectors don't use it is preferred stock preferred stock has different meanings in different parts of the world in Latin America preferred stock is this common stock without voting rights in the US though preferred stock is more like bonds because on preferred stock guess what you get you get a dividend that's set up front so unlike Equity we get a residual cash flow in preferred stock a promise to Dividend seven percent just like very expensive debt you know why it's very expensive that because unlike that where you get the tax benefit from interest expenses on preferred stock you get no tax benefits by itself preferred stock is an extraordinarily inefficient way to raise capital it's a stupid way to raise capital why do companies do it you know what the sector that use there are two groups of companies that use preferred stock one is very young companies that issue convertible preferred stock but that's really not it's really almost all conversion option the other is financial service companies and the reason Banks like preferred stock is it allows them to play the regulatory capital gain now normally if a bank borrows money It suffers in terms of Tier 1 Capital ratios The Regulators measure their Capital ratios and debt is not counted as part of tier one or two or tier three capital but preferred stock for whatever reason is treated by the regulatory authorities as Equity not debt subsurd rationale but Banks can now issue preferred stock very expensive debt but because it gets counted as Equity meet the regulatory Capital requirement so if any of your value Banks don't be surprised if there's a third component of capital you got Equity you've got debt you got preferred stock treat it as a third component give it its own cost the cost to preferred stock is just the preferred dividend deal the dividend divided by the price and you've got it nailed down but let me go back to the convertible bond which I said was part debt part equity and talk about how you might be able to separate the two components let me give you an example let's suppose you have a company that is a hundred and twenty a convertible bond with 125 million dollar face value in a four percent coupon rate usually convertible bonds will have lower coupon rates because they give you this option as a kind of a sweetener and let's say this convertible bond is trading in the market for 145 million so the face value is 125 million the coupon rate is four percent and the market value of the convertible bond is 140 million and it's a final piece of information let's say if this com this company is a rating of single a and that single a rated bonds have a interest rate of eight percent so if this company had issued straight bonds it have had to pay an eight percent coupon instead it issue convertible bonds so here's my task for you you know the total value of the convertible debt is 140 million you're trying to figure out how much of that is debt and how much is equity here's a trick a neat little trick in which you can separate the two check your eye to the conversion option act as if this were a straight point with a four percent coupon rate and a one thousand one twenty five million dollar face value remember how we valued a bond you take the present value the coupon plus the present value the face value using the eight percent rate which is the current market rate you come up with 91.45 million you're saying what does that mean if this convertible Bond were just a bond there was no conversion option it would trade at 91.45 million what's it trading at 140 million what's the extra 48.55 million for the conversion option you take that you put into Equity the 48.55 you put the 91.45 into debt you got rid of the hybrid it's now debt and Equity you can move on I've been doing this for 30 years I heard that IFRS now requires companies with convertible debt to now do it eventually accountants catch on that convertible debt is not zero one which magically goes from debt to equity that it becomes gradually Equity as the stock price Rises because the conversion option becomes more and more valuable Professor why would we not do we not do we not treat the call option within the convertible okay because there are two pieces right you can either value the option part of the Dead part which you think is easier I think the debt part is easier why bring in a black shoals model to Value the option you're right that's the other way I could do it is to Value the conversion option and treat the rest as debt I just think it's easier to Value the debt portion but you're right I could value the conversion option in fact if you don't have a market value then you might have to Value the conversion option with an option pricing model and come up with the value of equity like you do with employee stock options exactly yeah okay got it so let's recap the cost to Capital so cost of equity comes from a risk-free rate a debate and Equity risk I mean the cost of debt is the rate at which you can borrow money long term today just for the tax benefits the weights a market value rates can those weights change over time for your company yeah which means your cost of capital can change over time do you open the door in fact I'm going to argue that most valuations your cost of capital should shift over time as your company changes a company with a stable constant cost of capital should be the exception not the rule any questions on discount rates because we're going to put discount rates to rest and start at least on the discussion of cash flows okay so let's start talking about cash flows I'm going to set the table often I hear analysts talk about free cash flows I you know you go to Bloomberg it says FCF you go to Capital IQ it says FCF and I'm always left puzzled because FCF isn't complete right to whom to equity or the firm so let's set the table free cash flow at Equity versus free cash flow free cash credit Equity is an after debt cash flow free cash flow to the firm is a pre-dead cash flow and if you look at the calculation I've set them side to side so you can see what you do in parallel and what you do differently free cash flow Equity starts with net income why because it's an equity cash flow I'm looking at Equity income free cash for the firm starts with operating income because it's before interest expenses free cash for the firm I actually have to compute a hypothetical tax on their operating income because the taxes and the income statement reflect interest expenses being tax deductible so net income is the starting point for free cash flow Equity after tax operating income is the starting point for free cash flow to the firm and then in both calculations you subtract out what the company is reinvesting in what both long term and short-term assets so measure what it's investing in long-term assets I'm going to include okay I'm going to take the difference between capital expenditures and depreciation why the net effect because depreciation is an operating expense but it's not a cash expense it pays for some of capex it's called net capex net capex measures what you're putting into long-term assets and change in non-cash working capital measures what you're investing in inventory receivables short-term assets first let me ask you a question do you have to reinvest as a company is there some law that says you have to reinvest now you can put no reinvestment so if you show me a company and you say I'm not reinvesting anything I'm not going to fight you until I get to your growth rate you know why I'm going to fight you there because if you said my company will grow 20 a year and I'm reinvesting nothing I'm going to say well how the heck do you put pull off that magic the assumptions you make about reinvestment are tied to your growth assumption we talk about the explicit die but reinvestment is what you're putting back in The Firm when you do free cash flow to the firm you subtract our reinvestment you're done but you're doing free cash flow Equity or one final cleaning up to do think like an equity investment when you take on new debt when you borrow money the minute after the borrowing is approved what happens cash comes into the company right from the lender and every time you repay that that's cash leaving the company so the final element you're going to see in free cash flow Equity that you will not see in free cash for the firm is this net debt cash flow how much am I borrowing that's a cash inflow minus how much am I repaying which is the cash outview so keep this page handy because you're going to see people being extraordinarily sloppy about free cash flows and you want to hold them accountable and say what cash flow you're Computing are you being internally consistent in how you're Computing free cash flows so if you're going to break down free cash flow computations I break them down to three steps first step is you need earnings right net income or operating income which means if your accountant is playing games with me you're screwed right because your earnings number is screwed up everything else is going to be screwed up we're going to talk about accounting fraud and why your evaluation can't tell you about accounting fraud because it's built on accounting earnings we'll talk about some of the checks you can run but that's your starting point second you got to figure out how much your company's reinvesting to grow and third you got to look at these cash flows from that so let's start with you know by by setting this up at least in generic form as you go through the past quizzes and this is my unhappy duty to remind you that your first quiz is a week from today so I'll send it and I've sent you the practice quiz the review session and as you go through the past quizzes you'll see me compute free cash for the firm and you're going to keep thinking there are a dozen different ways this guy seems to be using to compute free cash flow there's only one but algebraically I can take that one way of computing free casual and express it in different ways let me explain the long way of computing free cash for the firm you just saw is after tax operating income minus this capex minus depreciation plus change in working capital that's a correct computation that's what you see in every textbook but what if I took this number capex minus depreciation and change in working capital and Consolidated and called it reinvestment it's the same thing right I'm just giving it I'm just consolidating the numbers after tax operating income minus reinvestment is free cash flows of firm as well so if I give you a prom and I said that reinvestment is 50 million the reinvestment includes net capex and change in working capital or I could take the reinvestment stated as a percentage of the after tax operating government said 30 percent of your after tax operate income is reinvested I'm saying the same thing just in different form ultimately all free cash flow firmware after reinvestment but how I get there can be different depending on whether I did the Long Way the shortcut or using the nation but in all of these computations there's one thing that you're going to see missing my free cash flow The Firm does not include the tax savings that I get from interest expenses I'm open about this I don't include it which is strange right because that's a real tax savings so why am I excluding those tax savings from interest expenses when I compute free cash flow of the firm what is my rationale for excluding it because this is free cash flow to firm and not Equity holder so it's we are not actually but where is your answers do I just ignore it as a disappeared in here I mean I have to show it in my valuation ultimately right so where if it's not showing up in the cash flows was the only other place it can show up or do I discount these cash flows back in go to free cash flows from get discovered discount rate you use for free cash flow firm wow and what caused no cost of capital we just went through the calculation cost of equity Anna it has caused that um the tax benefit from interest expenses shows up in my discount rate that's why I don't count the same tax because that'll be double counting right if I increase my cash flows to the same tax benefits and I lower my discount rate I'm dabu County that's why the tax savings from interest expenses should not be part of your free cash flow firm why do you do that is it because the tax savings are sort of because what's the alternative if I wanted to show my cash save a tax savings in my cash flows what should I use as my cost of debt when I do cost of capital pre-tax free tax cost to debt you can do it either way I think it's easier to adjust the discount rate because then you can capture the fact that I might have to wait three years so you can pick one or the other but you got to pick your poison you can't do it in both places because there'll be double double counting but you're right I can count the tax savings in my cash flows and then use the pre-tax cost to debt my discounted to make my discount rate higher and is your method gonna give a cleaner view of the cash the business is throwing up as opposed to the temperature because often people describe the free cash flow the firm as an unlevered cash flow which is the cash flow you'd have had with no debt the minute you start adding the tax savings from debt to the cash flow you can't use the word unleavit anymore because clearly The Leverage is affecting the cash flow so to the extent that you want your free cash for the firm to be an operating cash flow unaffected by your leverage choices it's probably better to keep it in the discount rate because then you can keep the two things separate makes sense talk about free cash rate Equity again I'm going to lay out all of the different Pathways I can get to free cash flow Equity the long way I start with net income subtract out reinvestment then bring in the cash flows and debt that's what you saw as my calculation the second I can take the the chain capex minus depreciation change from working capital call it reinvestment not bring in the net debt cash flow come up with free cash flow equity or I can make the net debt net it out against reinvestment called Equity reinvestment effectively all I'm saying is when you see these different terms my endgame is still the same I want to come up with after that cash flows so if you find one of these equations confusing just go to whatever equation you find comfortable because if you do it right you should get exactly the same answer no matter which pathway you use ultimately free cash flows Equity should be after all debt cash flows so I'm going to send you a link to a blog post I wrote in October of 2022 because I got sick and tired of seeing fcffs and fcfes on equity research analyst reports that were neither fcffs nor fcfe because people are messing up on every single dimension so I took Microsoft and I used to illustrate all so basically you'll see links to the financial statement so it's very pragmatic that this is where I went to the statement of cash flows this is what I did and essentially I go through both the free cash for the firm calculation that's what you see to the right and the free cash for the equity calculation for Microsoft if I said this chart tells you nothing but read that post because if nothing else it'll make you comfortable with what you're doing differently in the two approaches and why it's dangerous to mix and match okay so let's get started on getting cash flows right so when you think about getting cash flows right you know clearly the starting point is Onyx that's why I said you know you got to trust accountants at least a tiny bit to do free cash for the firm because the earnings numbers are coming from them already talked about updating I'll add a couple more things to it but you want the most updated earnings you can training 12 month numbers work fine in some cases I've actually used unofficial numbers because until recently there were some parts of the word where you didn't get quarterly reports you got these bits and pieces of reports I want the updated numbers in some cases you might find yourself normalizing numbers I'll come back and talk about this more in the next session you think when would I do this you know oil companies were the most profitable companies in the world last year and that just two years ago oil companies were among the least profitable companies were 2020 you think what changed what do you think changed what's the difference between 2020 and 2022 that explains the swings and all kinds of oil prices oil prices right so you can already see when valuing an oil company if I use my base your numbers they happen to be a really good year I'm going to overvalue companies and if I use my base year number it turns out to be really bad here I'm going to undervalue companies so simple fixes a rather than use last year's numbers why don't I normalize easier said than done but you're trying to average earnings across the cycle so commodity companies and cyclical companies sometimes you might replace last year's numbers with a normalized version but there's one thing you need to do whenever you use earnings and that is clean up after your accountants because internally they have these inconsistencies that can affect what you see as earnings I've kind of opened the door for that a little bit when I talked about r d with the start of the classes it's really a capex they treat us an operating expense and until 2019 there was a financial expense that accountants routinely categorized as an operating expense you know what I'm talking about they do it finally they've got come to their senses what's the financial expense at pre-2019 was treated as an operating releases operating leases it was I never understood why they did it finally they came around in 2019. so I want to talk about cleaning up after accountants but let me do a quick stop on updating why do we update because we want to Value companies as of today not as of six months from now nine months ago and for younger companies it's critical that you update get the most updated numbers you can and to get trailing 12 month numbers many of you might think I need four quarterly statements which is a pain in the neck all you need is one annual report and my your most recent quarterly report if you have the most recent annual report in the most recent quarterly report Computing trailing 12 month is a simple exercise if you don't believe me I think this week's valuation tools webcast will show you how to get to trailing 12 month from a 10K and a 10q or an annual in a quarterly report it's not difficult to do I don't know how many of you who have signed up for Capital like you yet I hope most of you have if you haven't please use your access it's free while you're an MBA student it's no longer free once you leave the school but the nice thing about Capital IQ is it actually gives you the trailing 12 month numbers you know so you can actually they do it for you use the most updated numbers but I have a bigger task in front of me which is I want to clean up after my accountants after and as I said there are two items on which I worry one is this financial expense that accountants have routinely miscategorized as an operating expense I'm talking about leases and the second is capital expenses like r d that they've routinely miscategorized as operating expenses so I want to take you through the process of capitalizing both using why bother with leases they do it I want to show give you a window on what accountants are doing with leases now that they all always should have been doing so you can get a sense of what exactly are accountants doing when they capitalize leases so let me set the table on leases in some businesses leases are not a big deal this is not a big issue but in some businesses are a huge deal so here's what I did I went into companies financial statements and looked at lease expense as a person of sales because that's going to give me a perspective on which sectors is this a big issue the top air transportation what are the lease almost every aircraft is leased no but no Airline buys its aircraft at least its aircraft Trucking trucks at least they're not bought restaurant and dining they know they lease the spaces retail these are the businesses where leases are a big deal so I'm going to start by giving you my rational for why leases have always been dead notwithstanding the accounting mistreatment I mean here's how I think about that debt is any source of capital that gives rise to contractual commitments you know what I mean by that you take a bank loan there's a contractual commitment you've got to make interest expense you issue corporate bonds as a contractual commitment to pay coupons when you sign a lease a 10-year lease is a retail store did you enter into a contractual commitment it's not a trick question of course you did right you signed the contract agreeing to pay a million dollars every year for the next 10 years in what universe is this not debt leases have always been dead we can argue with that senior debt or or a secured debt or or less secure debt but it leases have always been there so for 30 years now on my data sets I've always capitalized leases I couldn't wait for accountants to come to their senses and here's what you need to do to capitalize leases you take the contractual commitments you've already entered into you take the present value of those commitments so if you tell me you have contractual commitments of 100 million every year for the next five years I'm going to take the present value of those commitments using the pre-tax cost of debt as my discount rate I'm going to end up with a debt value of leases I'm going to put that on my balance sheet now balance sheets of a very unpleasant requirement which is that they have to balance right so if I put a 500 million dollar lease debt on my balance sheet what do I have to do on the other side to make balance sheets balance I've got to create account set to Lisa and once I create an asset what do I have to do in subsequent periods to depreciate the damn thing you see this is a pain in the neck you're right it's a pain in the neck but you have to do it which means when you capitalize leases you're going to see the following changes in your balance sheet you're going to see debt show up which wasn't there before your operating income now has to get restated because you no longer can subtract out the entire lease expense because you can subtract out only the depreciation portion of it everything changes when you capitalize leases so the final exercise for today here's what I'd like to do I'm going to take you through a company where I capitalize leases I actually did this for this company 25 years ago because they thought that an accounting change was imminent now eight almost 20 years ago they thought an accounting change was imminent first thing I said when I walked in was I said an accountant's definition of imminent is very different from the definition for the rest of us because this was in 2003 you know when that imminent change actually occurred right it happened in 2019 now but they were it might happen in 2004 so they said what will happen to our numbers we capitalize leases so I took them through the process I first took the least commitments it entered into and U.S companies have had to show this in the footnotes for as long as I've been looking at footnotes for 40 years I took those lease commitments so these are not expected lease payments these are actual contractual commitments discounted them back at the pre-tax cost of debt for the gap which was six percent what I got as a present value is 4.4 billion dollars that's now going to show up on my balance sheet as debt and wherever I use debt in my calculations like in the cost of capital you're going to see me add the 4.4 billion to that conventional debt the total debt for The Gap is much greater than what you saw on the balance sheet I also restated their operating income I took their actual operating income which is about a billion dollars added back the lease expense why because I should never have subtracted it out in the first place not an operating expense and this thing what's this 43.97 divided by 7. see this 4397 debt value it creates an asset right with a seven year life because that's what the lease commitment is I said I'm not playing games with my you know accelerated depreciation some of the year I just took straight line depreciations This is the acid being depreciated over seven years so you add back the least expensive tract our depreciation you get an adjusted operating income if you're if you're really in a hurry there's a shortcut you can use but it's only for your really in a hurry you can take the operating income and add back the imputed interest expense you'd have had on the debt because if you claim it's dead there'd be an interest expense do it only if you're in a hurry the first approach with 1362 is the right one so I'm going to leave you with a final table because this is the table I showed the Gap and they went through various stages of delirium as I showed this table because initially they thought I was giving them good news and finally they had no idea what I was then they thought I was giving the bad news and finally they had no idea so I gave them the good news first I said if accountants capitalize leases you're going to show higher operating income right 1.012 will become 1.362 because you're adding back the least expense subtracting our depreciation they were very happy I said but there's some bad news on the balance sheet instead of showing 1.97 billion in debt you'd be showing 6.4 billion debt they were a little worried look more Levitt and I said but that's good news on the cost to Capital basis because because you're more debt your cost of capital will go down from the 7.31 percent I thought it was now they were hitting the roof they thought this is great I have higher earnings I have lower cost of capital life is good and I said there's one final catch the way we measure quality of Investments we compute the return and capital you make on the investment and we compare to the cost of capital in the if I stayed with conventional accounting all I counted in return and capital which because you look at Book value of debt is the 1.97 billion the return on Capital I get is 12.9 percent which is better than the 7.31 if I capitalize leases my return on Capital drops valid dramatically to 9.3 percent at this point they were they didn't know whether they were coming or going so what does it all mean I said that Ned effect the spread effect instead of looking like you're making 5.5 more than your cost of capital you're only making only three percent more than your cost of capital that net effect will dominate and I actually value the company using both and it turned that the value per share that I get for The Gap is lower after I capitalize leases because the spread dropped by so much so it depends on the company for some retail firms capitalizing leases will push up value for summer to drop really value relatively unchanged for some it'll drop value and the reason we capitalize leases to get a much better sense of both what you owe which is a good thing to know as well as what you're making on your projects so when we come back on Monday and we'll be back in in class we'll talk about capitalizing r d and how it plays out negate the intent is to get a much better measure of what am I really making on my investments because it's almost impossible to value a company if you don't have a sense of that so I will leave you with that and I'll talk to you next Monday so have fun folks thank you Professor thank you thanks I'll stay on for about five minutes if you have questions Andrew you have a question thank you uh yeah hi professor um I want to ask a quick question about like how you recommend uh what do you recommend is the best way to prepare for the quiz next week well do a lot of problems don't here's the one thing you cannot do don't just review the notes and say I kind of get this I'm going to be okay because you're going to get to the quiz it's open book open Notes you don't have to memorize equations but if you've never work through prompts you're going to be in trouble so first step review the slides and get it from the material then go through the practice quizzes the first one or two you can use the solutions as a crutch right so you can check it but then try to use the solutions less and less and have at least one or two that you take without looking at the solution for the 30 minute time frame yeah I would say at least six quizzes is a good idea so two that you do with complete support do what you do with partial support and two without any support I think that's probably the best way to get ready okay cool and is that like is this quiz like in person like in the auditory everything is in person okay got it thank you uh Professor uh I got a question at the uh size one zero nine uh about the we will be decomposing the convertible bonds like yeah oh the the goal we're trying to do that is deposing it into the debit and the equity and in the market value version but here when we do that as a method we mentioned in the thread it seems like we put the depth to the present value which is basically that is always present value so if you show a bond what's the market valuable Bond [Music] it's always present value yeah that is never Book value that's why with embryer I converted the book value into a market value so when you do debt in a cost to Capital don't show what you owe based on the balance sheet you got to convert that an estimated market value right but that's always the end game so this is not the exception this is what you do with all debt not just convertible debt all debt normally the market value of debt can be close to book value because we take if this Bond had been issued at a fair market rate let's say there was no conversion option let's say it issued the bond with an eight percent what did the present value of The Debt Pay be exactly equal to the book value the reasons market value and Book value vary is because you borrowed money at a rate that's different from the market interest rate today [Music] oh yeah yeah so English method we still have the market value of debt that and the equity of the common proponent exactly okay thank you you're welcome so what up another question what do we do here is just about we want to separate it and uh throw the equity in with the market cap of equity to come up with the total value of equity to use in the weight you take the 91.45 million added onto your other debt to come up with the debt portion that then becomes a wait for your debt and equity in your car oh that's always when we capture that's where it meant yeah yeah thank you thank you so much Professor I will take my question next time my question was more on capitalization of lasers let's wait till next time because I will start next session with capitalization of leases and I'm going to ex expand and argue that it's not just leases is there any kind of contractual commitment is that and I'll give you examples Netflix yes when it gets the rights to the Seinfeld show for the next five years and agrees to pay a half a hundred million every year for the next five years is effectively borrowing money yes right so I'm going to argue that this is any time you have a contractual commitment over many years you got to treat it as debt because you're effectively you've locked yourself in you've used up some debt capacity I'd know what uh PSG plays messy but I'm going to look it up before I come to class but I think they pay him what 30 million a year for the next three years or what in fact even better is what Ronaldo is making from alness I think he's making what 50 million for the next five years that's that's effectively boring money to contractual commitment you got to pay it in good times and bad times so basically it becomes like that so Professor these days we have Cloud subscriptions and we pay for now a cloud good challenges if it's a renewable subscription it's not debt if it's a subscription you've locked yourself in for multiple years I'm yeah so I've locked myself for the next three years you know and but I'm paying it monthly it doesn't matter as I said I don't care whatever what what what accountants do from the evaluation perspective you borrowed money I I wanted to pay my three million dollar from uh Capital Money rather than earn that money but I ended up paying with Oldham last year and I'm not saying you did a good thing or a bad thing I'm just saying you have a contractual commitment I'm going to treat it like that so we should talk to FSA be something to fix fix them no don't don't waste your time because you can do it yourself why do you want them to do the right thing I'd rather than them give me the right the the raw data so I can do it myself Connor follows the rules from FS Liberty and they our accounting team doesn't budge they don't give us a capital treatment so that becomes a challenge every year that we face you got to fight that fight it's an it's not easy to fight it takes them forever to change thank you oh Professor um I just remember that uh during the explanation at the cost one of our classmates said that we can use a black shoes model to capture the option value of the converter convertible option but if we use a black shoes model it's not I think it's not the market value of the option of them but three days as a equity part if the black children I think we measure is intrinsic value of this same comfortable option same thing you know why are you drawing a line between intrinsic and market value and unless you know you could have the bond that we just valued is not a market value it's an intrinsic value okay so if you want to play that that game that basically means that you're almost you have no Moorings at all because no the weights are supposed to be market value weights you're saying market value is not equal to intrinsic value then everything has to be intrinsic value right market cap is not intrinsic value we use it anyway why do we use it because that's what the market that's what you have to pay in the market today yeah so I I don't think that's a big issue okay we know the total value all it means is you're putting more into one and less into the other oh yeah yeah that's true that's true okay thank you take care see you uh Professor just wanted to clarify so exactly how are you using the Black Gold formula to Value the company like use black shots you don't value the company the conversion option a convertible bond is an option it's a very small piece yeah the whole process so I'm not sure what you mean by how to use the black shows you have to all of the options inputs would be in the conversion option right there's an s a k or an R so you just plug the numbers so the using of the Black Shoals is the easiest part of this process because all the parameters will be given to you in the conversion option right but um in terms of like estimating the volatility because black shows formula treats that has a given but it's not actually like for example if a company is not it's the easiest cavali inputs look up there's a publicly traded company right stroke is traded you have oftentimes the price um of an option like doesn't match the actual underlying volatility that's the discrepancy between implied and underlying volatility right I think you you're lost in in the in the forest of options this is you know that's not a problem with the black shows it's the problem with how you compute variants if you're asking should I use an implied variance from options issued by the company or should I use a historical variance no you know you can make your choice but that's the least of your worries you know that's you know that's a third decimal point problem uh okay any model out there that doesn't require estimates that could be wrong I mean black shows probably is the least exposed to mistakes on your inputs because the fewest outside estimates I see got it thank you so don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good true yeah understood take care and talk to you later 
thank you babe thank you foreign a lot to do today so let me get started first remind you first quiz is Day After Tomorrow first 30 minutes of class no so so don't show up late yeah now we will write on the quiz but you know you can bring scrap paper my suggestion is you keep your work as much as you can on the quiz because it's not multiple choice so yeah I look for steps to see if you got through each step so no but I made it one-sided so if you make a mistake you can scratch it out right in the back of the page so there's plenty of page to write it but if you want to bring scrap paper so you can do calculations on this side you're welcome to now but you can bring a calculator if you don't have a calculator create a calculator on your phone create one on your iPad you know because more and more people seem to have no physical calculators it's some virtual calculator you know but no Excel you kind of if you open your laptop it's only to check slides now so no you can't go into Excel go into any of those and it's for your own protection because once you do that it's you know mutually assured destruction in terms of where we go second I did send out a couple of emails about the fact that I will have extra office hours tomorrow from five to seven I want to delay it as much as I could because there's no point having office hours about a quiz before we've actually prepared for the quiz so you got past quizzes you can look at review sessions my suggestion is if you've just started preparing don't start with 1997 and work forward that's the wrong strategy start with 2022 and work backwards right because they're more relevant in terms of material I cover it's going to change in fact the original exams are midterm exempts I used to have one in the middle of the class I think the 1997 might be a midterm rather than a quiz so work backwards right and at least have one or two quizzes that you have as hold out quizzes we don't realize how much you use a solution as a crutch until you don't have it so you know you see the solution you say that was pretty obvious and you move on sometimes it's good not to think it's obvious take 30 minutes see how far you really get because that's going to tell you and do it earlier tomorrow rather than at the very end because if you find out at midnight you're not quite ready what the heck are you going to do right so it's a good way to see if you are in fact ready for the quiz yes 30 minutes there is class after the quiz so stay after you're done don't leave because we will continue after the 30 minutes okay so today we're going to we're going to flows which is what the quiz will cover but I want to start today's um today's start of the class quiz by looking at a couple of things we're going to run into today okay one is um you know some of you are valuing money losing companies and many analysts value money losing companies one of the ways they deal with the fact that there are losses is by normalizing earnings sounds like they're doing something fancy but their version of normalizing is take the average earnings over the last five years and replace the current earnings with that number now I wanted to think about what your implicit assumptions are when you do that when you replace current earnings with an average of five years I'll go through these assumptions and you tell me whether you're making these assumptions and you replace last year's earnings the normalized number first is that you're assuming that last year's loss was unusual and that they're going to revert back to a more normal time are we assuming that yeah I think so that the problems that cause the laws are pretty much disappeared yeah I think so too because you're replacing that loss third the business has not changed in any fundamental ways if you have disruption going on and your business is actually becoming worse averaging by using the last five years is not going to help you that too and the company is not scaled up or down let me explain why that matters when you take the average dollar earnings over the last five years even if that's normal you're missing the fact that your company might have doubled in size over the last five years using dollar earnings will basically mean that you're understating the earnings for this company assuming that this is the normal earnings there are ways of getting around it you could use average margins over the last five years and apply to revenues but basically any time you normalize by using average earnings from the past you are in effect making all of these assumptions so how many companies do you think you can get away with doing this very very few maybe old-time cyclical companies where there's been a recession you can normalize Onyx but if you have a Peloton for God's sakes don't normalize earnings it's not going to get you anywhere for most of your money losing companies it's not going to work we'll look at ways of getting around that there are other things you can do second we're also going to talk about free cash flows Equity towards the end of today's class and we all know how to compute it right it's an after that cash flow so you start with net income you subtract reinvestment you subtract out net debt cash flows you come up with a free cash flow equity and sometimes that number can be negative in fact for many young companies the number will be negative because you have losses and you've got reinvestment on top of it and in our discounted cash flow valuation just a number right minus a billion minus a billion minus a billion etc for the next four or five years so when you forecast out these free cash flow equity and they're negative for the next five years and on a spreadsheet you see negative numbers what do you implicitly assuming the company will be able to do each year for the next five anybody want to try it's not dead it's free cash rate Equity it actually has to be Equity you raise right it's got to be external Capital but it's got to be equity is that a bad thing not necessarily but for that to happen markets have to stay open and accessible is that a safe assumption I'll give an example I'm going to show you evaluation of Amazon I did in 2000 peak of the.com book negative cash flows without a batting of an eye I assume that they could raise the capital you know why because I was caught up in the mood of the moment.com company raising Capital how easy can it get at the peak of the.com for one year later I valued Amazon still negative cash flows but now I was more cautious why because I could see how quickly markets can shut down a lot of companies that thought markets would stay open and accessible in 2021 are discovering because Venture Capital put up risk Capital pullback that you can be right on your cash flows but be unable to raise the equity to go so what happens if you cannot race so you come up with a negative let's say free cash rate Equity is estimated to be a minus a billion you come in exactly as estimated good job right you got to forecast right but you're unable to raise the billion to keep going what happens to your company then it's done the game is over Nirvana is not showing up you're not going to get to terminal value you could but if you are the kind of company we're talking about right the assets you're going to sell are going to be a fraction of the going concern value these are not large physical assets right you're not selling infrastructure you're not selling plant and Equipment you might have some patents brand names you could sell but remember your bargaining position is shot to hell everybody knows you need cash the biggest reason.com companies went bust in 2001 is not because they're dead but because they just ran out of cash and could not raise fresh capital so when we talk about free cash flow Equity we're going to talk about the life cycle of a company and how free cash flows Equity vary across and how companies at some stages in the life cycle are more exposed than others to Market shutting down so lots of stuff on our agenda let's talk about going back and let's talk about leases we talked about converting leases to debt somebody give me the intuition why do we convert leases to that what is it about lease leases that make them dead oh anybody want to try what what makes Lisa's debt yeah it's a contractual commitment right and by not trading leases that think of what my what accountants did they misstated operating income why because they were taking a financial expense and trading it as an operating expense notice the word as it used misstated now are not under because it can cut both directions they also when you looked at the balance sheet were not telling the truth about how much these companies owed five years ago if you looked at Walmart's balance sheet you saw debt which was conventional debt what you were missing was all of those least commitments it entered into so the debt was misstated the operating income is misstated so in the correct releases which hopefully accountants are doing right now here's what you're doing first you restate the operating income what does that mean you take the existing operating income you add back the least expensing I should never have subtracted a doubt then you subtract out the depreciation you'd have had at the least answer the messy process but you're effectively saying If This Were debt I'd have create NASA the answer of depreciation you restate the operating income in most cases it'll push up the operating income for companies with lots of lease commitments in some cases it can pushed down but most cases will push it up so to make your earnings look better you go to the balance sheet and you look at a Walmart today you're getting a much better sense of what they actually are as long as you don't try to remember is the weirdest thing is accountants sometimes do the right thing you know what analysts do they reverse it so with stock based compensation accountants that the writing treated as an expense and let's add it back I've seen analysts now add back the lease debt or take it out saying no I'm uncomfortable because I've always treated just traditional debt but if you follow the debt in the balance sheet now you're getting a clearer sense of what these companies actually are sir um no you're not subtracting the first payment right you're taking the asset that's created then you're applying some kind of depreciation method to it right say we have a 10-year lease you in fact have a 10-year asset so you take the present value the least it's almost like you're writing off one tenth each year you just take consistent the notion that if I capitalize something I should appreciate it especially if it's a finite lease so it's not just adding back the first years maybe there's a timing issue your depreciation should be based on last year's lease asset maybe that's what you're talking about in which case I have to go get the least commitments from last year I can't take this year's lease commitments in law Prof one because the contractual commitments had last year are going to be different from the contractual commitment I just don't want to be giving you two years of financials that's why I take the shortcut but in effect I'm restating your earnings I'm restating your debt and it changes my perspective on your company what kind of return and capital do I earn what kind of all of those numbers now get altered because I'm trade taking what I think is a more realistic measure of what leases should be basis anybody follows IFRS a gap has to it's not a choice anymore so 80 of the word capitalizes leases Asia though you can come into countries which have their own so it's really a very it's smallest segments of the world that are uncovered so Asia in particular is not fully covered by IFR as a gap they have their own accounting systems and some have started capitalizing leases but they give a lot of loopholes okay one example I think in Indian accounting if you have a renewable lease it's not treated as debt the argument being well you have the option to walk away even though you might not but it much of the word is at least that is now that you don't know if it's a U.S company you could almost guarantee it it's there but the nice thing is they still give you the least commitments as a footnote so you can double check that's why for the last three years I've been capitalizing leases even though accountants have done it for me because I just don't trust them hey so accounting did come to its census finally in 2019. 70 years after they realized there was a problem they're capitalizing leases now it's part of debt in much of the world okay yes that was going to be my next point right let's look think of examples I think I mentioned did I mention the Netflix example now let me mention it now Netflix has a commitment that we should be capitalizing as debt and the commitment is content commitments all those movies and shows that I don't know what they paid for friends when they originally guarded or the rights for The Avengers it's usually a five or a seven year contract you agree to pay 70 million a year for the next seven years it's essentially that this is not just leases any kind of long-term contractual commitment where you have no Escape classes is effectively that you know you've heard about Nasser it's a it's a Saudi Soccer Club and now they have a three-year contract with Ronaldo for how much a year 75 million each year for the next three years it's a contractual commitment it is that if you had to Value all NASA you better be treating that as debt so this is part of a much broader question of hey you've entered into contractual commitments you've effectively used up debt capacity it's really cautionary note to companies don't go out and add to that by going out and taking a bank loan because it'll make you even more in debt so as I said I've been while I've accounted to be doing this since 2019 I've been doing my own calculations using the lease commitments to see how close I get so let's take the US the U.S if you look at my estimate it's 1.152 trillion the accounting estimate is 9.50 you know I'm within and I may I you know I don't allow the the even the little Escape hatches that are counted so I just treat all commitments as that but I'm pretty close if you look at Australia not bad 61 percent you're up I'm starting to lose some traction 47 you go to emerging markets and Japan you completely lost me because what accountant Street as debt is very sporty so my advice to you is with every company capitalized leases in some cases you're going to capitalize that that was a waste of time you can just use the accounting debt in others you will have to do the capitalization on your own and for company like Netflix none of that none of the contractual commitments content commitments are treated as debt you have to do that that's why I've left the lease worksheet as part of if valuation gives a spreadsheet just in case you have some items that you want to capitalize yes thank you once companies just enter into one-year leases to make the debt go away right what's the same thing lend trees are there's different words for the same thing a one-year lease is like a one-year I mean effectively it's no if the one year lease wouldn't show up in your balance sheet either there'll be no commitments right it's a much more flexible company but there's a consequence right it has less debt but what's a danger every year you've got to go to the landlord right to renew your lease God knows whether you get the lease renewed whether you'll get a 15 increase so everything is a trade-off here it's true that by entering into short-term leases you could reduce the debt on your balance sheet but you've also made yourself a much riskier company in terms of your operations because without those stores you can't operate what if real estate values double over the next year you'll have to go out and then re-lock at a much higher lease right so it's true if you if your only objective becomes I don't want to have least debt I can give you a way to do it I'm not sure you could survive as a retailer a restaurant with that kind of business model well it's a riskier company may have higher may have less having less debt doesn't make you a better or worse company right it's just a different company so would you rather have a more indebted company with a more solid business model that you know is renewable or a company with less debt with a business model that every year has to get renewed based on what the lease Agreements are I'm not sure one wins out over the other right so it's not as if you're giving companies an advantage or a disadvantage by converting leases to debt you're just treating them realistically from a valuation perspective let's move on to the second big item that accountants schedule now we talked about r d r d is a capital expect because it creates benefits over many years and in some some sectors you can see it's a huge item no surprise a lot of pharmaceutical companies note in.com retail companies technology companies r d can be a huge percentage of Revenue as an expense and their sectors where it's not an issue beverage what kind of r d you're going to do if you're a beer company right where to form more form less form I don't know what you do research on so r d is not an issue in many businesses but in the businesses where it is an issue I think accountants miscategorization really screw up screws up the numbers they're taking the biggest capex these companies have and treating it as an operating expense I've always struggled with the accounting reasoning for doing it about 12 years ago I was asked to give the keynote speech at the aicpa conference you know the aicpa conferences right a lot of CPAs it was in a big hotel room in Vegas which already struck me as a kind of a strange place to have an accounting conference but Vegas has the biggest hotel rooms they're like a thousand accountants in the room close to my vision of hell they asked me to give a keynote speech I don't think I'm going to be invited back because the title of my speech was 10 things accountants do that I don't quite get at that time I listed leases as one of them why do you guys keep taking a financial expensive treaty but I got this is already I said I really don't get this my accounting professor told me that if you have an expense that creates benefits over many years it's a capital expense and here you have the ultimate Capital expense you know r d and you're expensing it tell me why but think like an accountant for a few minutes but then snap out of it because it can ruin your your way of thinking if you think like an accountant what's your accounting rationale for treating r d as an operating experience the key word is uncertainty they said the benefits are really uncertain I said what if I built a factory in Kazakhstan to produce computer tablets in a very risky business I mean Borat could come in and burn it down next year right you don't let me expense this okay so any investment is risky uncertainty it's never been the dividing line and everything else why are you insisting it on it just for r d they switched at they realize uncertainty was a dangerous place to go so they fell back on the classic accounting reasoning which is we're just being conservative you know in what sense expensing r d is conservative right you lower your income they say which we're reporting lower income we can have a debate on whether we want our income to be estimated conservatively or realistically I think realistic is better than conservative but I didn't even want to fight that fight I said let's assume that you are being conservative and you're lowering income what do you show on your balance sheet when you expense something it's a trick question nothing when you expense r d you've taken your biggest assets off the book so when I compute the return and Equity or the return and invested Capital technology firm I'm going to get numbers like 80 100 try it out for any Tech firm you're going to get 150 200 percent it's not because these companies make 150 Returns on their projects they're profitable but not that profitable it's because your biggest assets are off the books that's not conservative to me there's no good reason he's saying why aren't they doing something about it remember it took them 70 years to deal with leases it might take another 70 to deal with r d I can't afford to wait for them to do the right thing so let's do it right it's not that difficult to do to capitalize r d here's the process I'm going to go through I'm going to start by asking you a question it's going to be a tricky question to answer but a question that I think any business that spends a lot in Rd has to think about on average how long does it take between the time you do r d and a commercial product emerges notice I threw the words on average up front I understand some r d might might never pay off some might pay off in three years some in seven some in ten let's say on average takes you five years we are already to pay off here's what I'm going to do I'm going to go collect the r d expenses you had last year two years ago three years ago four years ago five years releasing why are you going backwards in time because if I decide to capitalize r d i can't just start now I've got to be doing all the way through and if my r d takes five years to pay off what's a logical thing to do take one-fifth of it each year right I'm going to keep track of how much of that is being written off this year and how much hasn't been written off yet so it sounds too abstract so let's just try it on a company German company called sap I'm going to try to move that up I'm sorry you've heard of sap it's a German software company it competes with Cisco it's a business to business company very well run technology company now I I totally amortizable life I'll give you a very simple indicator what I use as amortizable life for pharmaceutical companies in the U.S we got to go through an FDA approval process and all kinds of testing I use a 10-year life that's a maximum I use if you're a software company I use two to three years no software company does already expecting benefits in 10 years compute with sap because it makes Hardware as well I'm going somewhere in the middle five years you're saying what if it's six what is for doesn't make that much video If you think four is better than five or you want to use six it's not going to make that much of a difference I collected the r d expenses from the last five years and the most recent year here's what I'm going to do I'm going to take the r d expense from five years ago 745 million remember I've been writing off one-fifth of it each year I write the last one fifth of this year and it's gone for my book so I keep track of what I'm writing off and what's left over already from four years ago I write off one-fifth there's one fifth left over aren't even three years ago right up one-fifth there's two fifths left over so I'm keeping track of both what I'm writing off and what's left of it if you add the last column you get 903 million euros you're saying what what does that capture if I've been capitalizing r d all the way through that's what I'd be amortizing this year on my income statement like depreciation this year from pasca you think what about the second last column 2.9 billion that 2.9 billion euros is now going to go to my balance sheet and I'm going to call it for lack of a better word my research Capital asset is basically what I've invested in research capital but of course balance sheets have to balance right so if I put 2.9 bill in the asset side I've got to add 2.9 billion to the other side and I have two choice I can add it to debt or I can add it to equity which one should I add it to it came out of equity earnings it's going to increase my book Equity questions because timing in a in a discounted cash flow evaluation is very weird so when I start my valuation I say this is Time Zero it's almost like I spent the money one second ago so whatever you show in the most recent year because of the way we they you know I assume everything happens at the end of the year so when you do evaluation at the start of 2023 using numbers to the end of 2022 because you're assuming that everything happens at a point in time you've just spent the money and you've just spent the money you can't depreciate it yet so if you did mid-year then maybe you have to do some Messier calculation of a half year depreciation but because we're using end of the year cash flows that number has just been spent it hasn't been depreciated yet and that's why it's still intact right yes [Music] where did the money come from right it came out of your net income it came out of after debt you know income so it is your income as so if I hadn't done that it'll come to you as retained earnings right so that's basically why it goes to equity because Equity investors are effectively paying for the RIT yes because it's one-fifth or whatever that the so this is one-fifth so it's not that it's different nature it's the expense from that previous year being right one-fifth of it being written off this year okay so as you're if you're already has been rising over time your amortization is also going to reflect that so here's what happens remember that operating income that we can that we saw in the income that was after r d expenses and now I'm saying I shouldn't have done that that wasn't no the number right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that operating income add back the r d expense it's very similar to what I'm doing with Lisa shouldn't have subtract that and I'm going to subtract out the amortization so my operating income is going to get increased by 117 million this sounds like a good thing right but wait there's another shoe waiting to drop and here's where that other shoe is when you do the calculation you're operating income will increase why because I've added back the r d subtract the amortization and my r d exceeds my amortization by 117 million there's a tax thing that I'll come back and deal with a loose end but my operating income will go on so I'll have higher earnings if you go to my balance sheet my book value of equity was 3.768 billion that's now going to be higher by 2.9 billion so my book value Equity went from 3.7 to 6.4 billion because I've added that unamortized portion I'm bringing your biggest asset onto the books capital expenditure if you look at the statement of cash flows is 2 million okay looks like the company's reinvesting nothing but that's not true if you add the 117 million that you're putting into r d that increases my capex from 2 million to 119 million so you see what's happening my income is increasing by 117 million my net capex is increasing by 117 million so what's my effect on free cash flow higher earnings higher reinvestment there's no effect exactly offset so you say why did we go through this torture if the free cash flow to the firm is not changing because it changes the composition of your free cash flow it gives you a much better sense of what your company is actually earning and what it's reinvesting my problem with tech company earnings right now is they're incredibly opaque they're off the capex a tech company can make its earnings look much better by cutting its r d to zero do you really want to invest in a growing tech company which not but that's exactly what happens when accountants routinely miscategorize your biggest capex yep the total amount to take one-fifth probably not no so you're just going to add up the five years of numbers mathematically you should get exactly the same number right but you should be adding up the five numbers and divide and it shouldn't make good it would it should if you're keeping track of the remaining Book value yes [Music] because remember the reinvestment ratio looks at what you put back into the firm divided by after tax operating coming the original sap calculation the reinvestment is 2 million on top of whatever the original operating income was I think it was one thousand two eighty five looks like they're reinvesting almost nothing right about one percent now you're going to see 119 million divided by 1 362 million so it'll increase your reinvestment rate which is I think much more realistic because the way we're doing things with these companies it looks like they're investing nothing when in fact they're putting huge amounts back into the business so let's be very clear we capitalize r d not because we want to get a better estimate of free cash for the firm it's not changing the free cash flow but because we want to get a better sense of what a company is earning and how much it's reinvesting fundamental questions you should be assessing when you're buying a company so if you think in terms of what accountants are doing now and what we're doing to correct for them accountants right now are misstating operating income and net income by expensing r d they're probably pushing them down the Microsoft's and the apples of the world actually make much more money than we think with think about it I mean you could take account like apple that's already profitable and then you clean up for the Rd your margin goes from 48 to 55 percent they're much more profitable than they truly are but accountants are understating profitability but the bigger problem is book values have lost all meaning at these companies that's why when people talk about Price to Book ratios for the S P 500 climbing over time one reason for that is the composition of the S P 500 Exchange for manufacturing companies where accountants at least have a sense of the book value to technology and service companies who they have absolutely no idea but just as with leases tip of the iceberg are there other expenses analogous to r d that you can think of that we should be capitalizing any give me an example you with an audience you take the biggest expense with consumer brand companies advertising right you watch the Super Bowl ads some of those ads are getting you to try to buy stuff right now but a big reason you run Super Bowl ads is not to get current consent but to build up a brand name okay and if your biggest asset is brand name then at least a portion of the advertising maybe not all of it should be treated as a capital expense I did this for Coca-Cola using a 30-year life because brand names build up over time it makes a huge difference to what you see as income and Book value at the company oil company there's something analogous to r d at all companies it routinely gets expensive I think should be capitalized exploration costs nobody explores saying I want all tomorrow how about a consulting firm think of your biggest asset human capital how do you build it recruiting and training expenses maybe not the annual salaries but the portion of the salary that you pay because you want to keep people working for you long term it changes the way we think about it and now I think we routinely miscategorize items outside of the traditional manufacturing companies and in valuation you're not bound by accountants coming to their census you have to do it yourself one final example if you're a company like uber or Netflix how do you measure success what is Netflix now get out and they do a non-export what's the number they they push Above All Else subscribers Uber's writers customer acquisition costs user acquisition costs subscriber acquisition costs are like capex this is a huge issue and I think we need to confront it directly because without doing it we're really valuing companies without having a sense of what's operating expense what's capital expense what's a financial expense any final questions on now let's do some cleaning up let's suppose you look at your company it has a loss about half a value but it's loss is coming from a one-time charge and it's truly one time and I'll be I'll explain what I mean by truly one time of a billion dollars your job just got very easy right to Value this company if it's a truly one-time charge remember all you care about is earnings in the future what are you going to use his earnings next year you have a loss of a half a billion ever one time just use a half a billiona's profit act like you're this is your easy scenario in your money losing company there's one big line item and it's truly one time just cross it out recompute your earnings without it you've normalized your income you've removed that one time but it's got to be a truly one-time charge it's like what does that even mean truly one-time charge let's say you look at your company for the last 25 years and every five years they have a one-time charge of a billion dollars you know what you should read in that this is not a one-time charge this is an annual expense that you're lumping up and taking every five years saying why would you do that because the extraordinary or one-time charges show up below the operating income line you can report earnings before extraordinary charges after extra and companies have become really good at playing this game of moving operating expenses into extraordinary or one-time charges and it's your job in my job to make sure that they don't get away with it so my advice to you is look at the you know if you can download the history of your company assuming it as a history look at their history of extraordinary charges if you see an extraordinary expense showing up once every five years in this case a billion dollars act like you have a 200 million dollar expense every year because that's basically what they're normalizing in which case you'll replace the half a billion dollar loss with a 300 million dollar profit you see why 300 million you're going to add back 800 million of the billion saying the remaining 200 million is going to be an expense anyway so if you have one time at extraordinary charges check to see whether they recurve they recur every year then they're clearly operating expenses if they change signs Year to your foreign exchange gains and losses then you can average across time maybe to disappear maybe it's again one year lost in another year but use your best judgment on those items don't just take last year's earnings even if they have extraordinary items in them and make that the base you're for building on my nightmare scenario value companies is valuing a company whether it's accounting fraud because let's face it you're building off accounting earnings accounting book value and if there's fraud the whole thing could be no just a everything could come over and the problem is after the fact we know but it's too late so the question is is there something we can look for before the fact to get our antenna quivering saying this company I should worry more about fraud is a whole branch of accounting perhaps the only branch of accounting that I would even think about entering which is called forensic accounting Toyota forensic accounting that's what short sellers hire forensic accountants what do forensic accountants do they go through financial statements looking for things that don't gel red flags one red flag by itself doesn't mean to come but if you see a dozen red flags and they keep recurring over time there's something going on I'll give you a few examples of red flags first is a company that reports income from unspecified sources shell companies you know andron did this year after year nobody had any billions of dollars coming in Again by itself it might be okay but if you see it in conjunction with other things time to worry income from assets as a job without a dent in Revenue so they're selling off half the business but their revenues stay intact how do you do that how do you sell off half your assets and keep getting the revenues sudden changes in expense items I don't I'm not a great believer in Computing percent of revenues but one of the nice things about doing person of revenues is when you see SG a go from 21 to 48 of revenues are from 48 to 21 you can stop and asking what the heck happened here you know where did that 27 go frequent accounting restatements if you go to the SEC side for your company every time you file a 10K you will see the 10K file but for some companies you'll see the 10K for 2021 and then you see 5 out of the 10K filings for 2021 because each time you restate your 10K you have to go back to the SEC so if you see a company consistently restating things again by itself it might be just an honest mistake but you see it recurring there's something going on one of my favorite measures is actually if you look at the net the income statement you get a measure of a cruel income you go to the statement of cash flows you get net income plus depreciation minus working cap but it's measure of cash income in any given year one can be higher the other can be higher but for some companies a cruel income consistently runs ahead of cash income year after year after year after year now again maybe you have a business model that explains it away but again that's something that might give rise to suspicion so if you get a chance take a look at your financial see if any of the red flag if you're interested I'll send you a couple of links for forensic accounting books that are readable most of them are completely unreadable I wouldn't even try but actually give you indicators one is by a guy called Terry Smith the UK based accountant great writer so you can see some of the things he looks for but I would look at companies let me know the short sellers like Hindenburg and Citron because that's their skill set that's what they do well they're not good at valuation but they're pretty good at forensic accounting which brings me to the money losing company at least one out of every five of you should be valuing a money losing company if you followed my instructions yeah am I looking at what just net income cash flow is okay yeah so you have negative net income and positive cash flow thank you is it close enough to zero the because remember the negative net income and positive if you're really close to zero I would treat it as a money losing company anyway which is you can't build off that net income that's what I'm saying now so let's talk about what to do about the money losing company so those of you doing money losing companies this is your page where you decide the template you're going to use if you have a one-time or extraordinary charge that's your easy scenario just take it out recompute the income you're home free it probably maybe for one out of every 100 companies so you can get away with this your company might have been affected by some macro effect 2022 was not an issue but 2020 oil prices dropped every Oil Company lost money those two factors you could fix by normalizing Onyx both cases assuming there's some kind of a cycle you're going to come back so if you have a money losing company either because a one-time charges or because of a macro Factory you think the cycle will you can replace so you can value an oil company even if it's losing money by looking at income over a cycle those are easy scenarios let's look at the more difficult ones you're valuing a young company you can't normalize the earnings and make them positive this is part of being a young company it would take them years to get to positive earnings you have to map out that path it's more difficult but there's no way around it we have a company with a structural problem something in its business model that's not working it's fixable but not fixable overnight maybe you're a manufacturing company or you abandoned or they're not taking taking care of your manufacturing facilities for a long time they're inefficient you got to make them efficient you can't make them efficient overnight in those two cases you can't replace losses with profits next year you've got to map out a pathway from negative income to positive income I'll show you some of the ways to map it out but that's the target margin where you use the target margin as an indicator that's where I want to be this is where I am I have to get them from here to there yes [Music] and in some cases you might decide that there is no way they can ever get two plus I'd be quite honest you could be Bed Bath and Beyond to value now there is no pathway I can see for them to make money no this is not a question if they'd cut costs that's why you know when you see a new person out as a CEO you gotta ask what's in your head what do you think you can do with this company so some businesses you might conclude there is no Pathway to value in which case the equity is worth nothing probably could get a liquidation value if you liquidated but that's entirely okay that's part of valuation as well is deciding not to push the envelope don't normalize every company don't make every company go back to help because that might not be and in fact I I think you straight you stuck you hit the nail on the head when you said is it the Management's fault or is it the fault of the BET as your business done bad if the business has done bad no management can really fix it it's on in a sense almost unfixable and so any questions on earnings because now I want to kind of tie up a few more loose hats so all of this work is to get the operating income or the net income out of the income statement but let's assume that it's operating income that you got out of the income State let's talk about what to do next remember you have to do after tax cash flows if you have operating income you've got to convert it to after tax operating in other words you multiply the operating above one minus the tax rate I remember when we talked about cost of debt what we talked what we said about tax rates what tax rate did you say we did we say we should use for cost of 10. the marginal tax right the argument being we're looking at savings on the margin interesting but here we're applying the tax rate to all of your operating income not to the margin so the debate becomes a little different so I'm going to give you some choices on what tax rate to use and I want you to think through the consequences of what will happen if you use that tax rate and value your company the first is you can use the effective tax rate which is the taxes paid divided by taxable income in the income statement is to give you perspective that number is about 16 or 17 for U.S companies so many U.S companies in apple last year at 12 effective tax rate Tesla at nine percent so you can use the effective tax rate the second is you can use a tax rate you compute it's not computed by anybody we take the taxes paid and divide by the operating income in other words you're Computing some kind of tax rate on operating income based on actual taxes paid let's call that a cash tax rate the third approach is to use the marginal tax rate of the country you're in that comes from the tax score the U.S it's 25 in Germany 29 So based on the part of the world you're in the fourth is you can use some kind of weighted average marginal tax rate of all of the countries you operate in the fifth is maybe it's none of the above but if that's none of the above you better give me what you're going to use instead because you can't just leave it on but this the final choice would be great if it were true which is use a tax rate but be consistent you know why it cannot be true if that were the case you know what tax rate we're always used in valuation just use the zero it's just a zero tax rate why mess with taxes if all you have to do is be consistent so let's take F off the choices it's not it let's take e off unless you have a really creative solution and think about effective versus marginal that's basically what it boils down to remember what I said effective tax rates for companies around 15 16 17 marginal tax rate is 25 percent if you use the effective tax rate you're going to increase your earnings increase your cash flows might be okay if the reason your effective tax rate is lower is permanent what do I mean by that Apple's effective tax rate is lower than the marginal tax rate because they generate income in other parts of the world where tax rates are lower than the US this isn't going to go away next year two years from now they're going to have almost a permanently lower effective tax rate because they're operating in countries with lower tax rates but remember well as you know or 10 years forever so basically unless you think Croatia is going to jump to the tax rate that that Germany is in you know now it could happen and if you think there's going to be some kind of convergence around a global tax rate then you can use that as your end game but if it's permanent then you can leave it at 16 but a lot of companies that have low effective tax rates the reason they have lower tax rates is because they've deferred taxes what does that mean they've taken taxes and pushed them to a future period right you have tax lawyers who can help you do this you have depreciation methods you can use some kind of credits you take and the tax court is full of things you can use to defer taxes the keyword is deferred taxes if I use that lower tax rate now as my tax rate forever you know what I'm effectively assuming about tax defer that you can defer taxes forever and there's a padded cell in a federal penitentiary waiting for you if you think that's a legitimate way for taxes eventually catch up with you you know when they start to catch up is when your growth starts to level up you'll see effective tax rates start to climb if that's the case you know what you need to do you can start with the effective tax rate because you're still deferring taxes but remember as you go through time you're allowed to change the tax rate you're not stuck with that same tax right you can move it towards a modular tax rate and in fact if you think Global tax rates are all going to converge in 25 we're going to end up with some kind of tax reform if that becomes the case you could push your tax rate start at 16 end at 25 percent he said why didn't I just go safe and just use the marginal attacks right all the way through you can but you're going to undervalue company right because for an apple you're definitely then overpaying taxes and understating cash flows by assuming they'll jump to 25 right now so use somebody being able to adjust tax rates over time and you could take advantage of the fact that your company has reasons for paying lower taxes now but those reasons might disappear yes it could if you have deferred taxes actually you could argue they're going to be as not permanently but you'll have a period so does everybody get the question which is you have 16 tax it's purely tax deferral when you start to grow you'll actually see 16 become 18 20 21 23 25 for a brief period you'll end up 28 29 31 before dropping back to 25. it's probably not worth the if eff effort of keeping track of that because when you get to the margin the terminal value you can use only one tax rate so unless you want to it's a big enough item that you want to keep track of it it's probably just best to leave it at 25 there's going to be some tax deferral things that will catch up with me but it's not worth the effort of trying to bring it into my cash flows okay so here's a simple rule if you're if you're if you're looking at free cash for the firm and you look at the tax rate you can you know you could start with the effective tax rate move towards the marginal if you're a multinational I still use my the country with Corporation for my tax rate partly because so many of my companies are either us or european I'll tell you when you might not want to use the country of incorporation if you're a Ryanair right you might not want to ever assume your tax rate comes to 12 which is your no so that's the decision you've got to make is is when you have a company that's in a low tax rate Locale you might have to look outside but I would say just stay with the contributed Corporation for the marginal tax rate look at their effective tax rate make a judgment on where you want to fall relative to those two one final point on on taxes you know and you all know this but I want to reinforce it if you're a money losing company remember not to leave your losses behind you know what I mean by that right you lose money you don't have to pay taxes but you do get another benefit which is you can carry those losses forward it's called an nol or a net operating loss in fact if your company has a net operating loss if you search your 10K or annual reports somewhere they should tell you how much they're carrying forward in that operating losses he said why would it matter the three billion dollars in net operating losses what that will allow you to do is not pay taxes in the first few years that you make money in fact if you have net operating losses on a company that you expect to keep making losses remember your nol will build up over time you need to keep track of it because it'll save you taxes in the years when you first start to make money so here's a very simplistic example of how an oil works you have a company with a billion dollars in net operating losses it's finally turned the corner it's starting to make money in fact it's expected to make half a billion every year for the next three years I've chosen the numbers so that you can do it in your hair you can already see what the bill in nol is going to allow you to do right year one how much you're going to pay in taxes zero your two zero and you're three you're going to pay your marginal tax rate that's what I've built into the spreadsheet is I keep track of the NOS so I ask you what's your nol then I keep track of your losses the first few years that you make money you'll notice you don't pay much in taxes or no taxes at all it's my way of bringing the effects of the nol into your free cash flow as opposed to what a lot of Bankers keep the animals separate treat it like an asset then they multiply by the tax rate to get the value the reason that's dangerous is first it assumes you get the tax benefit right away but you don't second it assumes the tax benefit is guaranteed right remember you have to make money eventually by building it into your free cash for the firm you're bringing in the time value of money and the risk that you will not be able to cover that nol it's a much cleaner way of dealing with nols foreign capex capex minus depreciation right again if you trust the accountants in the statement of cash flows you take the difference before we look at the mechanics of what goes into netcap X I want to step back and ask why do we have net capex it's because you want to grow in the future your assumptions about net capex have to be tied to your assumptions about growth notice I used your assumptions on both because you assume both and you have to be internally consistent so if you tell me I have high growth and high net capex I'm not going to fight you on it so what do you think about the company you say you have loan growth and low net capex I'm going to say that's perfectly okay but if you give me high growth and low net capex I'm going to push back and say how are you going to pull this up and your answer might be have a lot of excess capacity I don't but I need you to think about how those two internally inconsistent assumptions coexist in the same valuation the reason I emphasize that in banking valuations you get line item focused you know what I mean by that you do revenues you do operating income you do capex you do depreciation and after a while each line item takes on a life of its own right you're making assumptions about each one based on historical data based on Research what you fail there is to think about as I'm assuming more growth am I also thinking about capex because you cannot de-link those items in fact one thing to do actually is to link directly what you're assuming into reinvest into your growth rate so you're forced to think about what will it take for me to get this higher growth rate my simplistic device for that is that sales to Capital ratio where I say okay you want more growth this is how much reinvestment you'll need and you can overwrite me and say you know but I don't need it for the first five years I have excess capacity but essentially you have to think through what does growth mean in terms of how much I need to reinvest so let's think about the items that should go into net capex the accounting definition of net capex and we've nailed we've already said this multiple times it's too narrow it's built primarily on physical assets and for a copy like sap you're getting almost nothing so the first thing we did was we added back that r d effect and you could see what it did to you so with with the not just you know technology companies but with customer driven or subscriber driven companies you're going to get a big jump in netcap X once you capitalize those expenses but there's another way you can grow that I we haven't even talked about if you're in a hurry to grow and you don't want to take projects you don't want to acquire customers one at a time you go out and do an acquisition of another company I've never understood why Acquisitions are not treated as gigantic Capital expenditures because that's what they are I'm not saying they're good or bad they're just gigantic I mean Disney in one day when it bought Fox spent more on capex than it did on all of the movies it's produced over the last 50 years 74 billion dollars so I'm going to count Acquisitions as part of my net capex as well and this makes life difficult because Acquisitions can pay be paid for in one of two ways you can pay for the cash if you have a lot of cash on hand or you can pay with shares cash Acquisitions you find in the statement of cash flows but when you pay with shares it kind of disappears into the footnotes you can try to figure it out from the balance sheet but it's much more difficult to find and the the irony is your biggest Acquisitions they're often stock based they're not cash based so I'll give you an example from a company that was riding high in 1999 company called Cisco Cisco's market cap increased from 4 billion in 1990 to 400 billion at the peak of the.com boot a hundred fold over a decade and what made Cisco unique among technology companies was grew almost entirely through acquisitions of small technology companies so this is just one year 1999 I was trying to Value ciscals trying to figure out how much they reinvested that year very simple question they had very little RDA cleaned up for the r d but then I got to the Acquisitions and six of their Acquisitions were cash Acquisitions in 1999 accounting actually had two ways of dealing with Acquisitions if you paid with cash was called purchase accounting if you paid with shares it was called pooling purchase accounting get record Good Will yet pooling actually disappeared into God only knows where so there's six Acquisitions were purchased I was able to get the numbers right out of the statement of cash flows the other three I found in the footnotes but not in terms of actual money paid but in terms of number of shares they used to do the acquisition I had to go look up the average chip right around that day it was a pain in the neck but if you look at the three biggest Acquisitions they were all stock based Acquisitions my total Acquisitions in that year were two point was 2.516 billion dollars this was Cisco's big capex and again a company like Cisco it's particularly critical you do this because they do this year after year after it's not a one-time deal with Fox if you forget about acquisition I'm sorry with Disney if you forget about Acquisitions you might get away with it because they might never do an acquisition like the acquisition of fox but with Cisco this is their engine for growth in fact my Cisco net capex if you you know that was the accounting net capex statement of cash flows that was what they showed capex and depreciation 98 million was my net capex by the time I finished adding for the adjusting for r d and Acquisitions my total net capex at Cisco was not 98 ml it was 3.7 billion so what's the bad news and the good news when I have this much reinvestment what's the bad news the free cash flows The Firm are much more negative right what's the good news when I project our growth I can be much more expansive about my growth assumption this is not so that's why there's no good news or bad news about capitalizing something I'm not saying this company is going to get more or less valuable all I'm saying it's reinvesting a lot and that's going to drive growth so it's going to affect my cash flows and it's going to affect my growth as well any questions on net capex yes it's not saying the whole story yeah you know I as I said I I like roic as a metric but I think it's you know I've also talked about how flawed it is as a metric because first what's in the numerator operating income and accounting number what's your new denominator it's actually a book value of equity it's the only place you have one accounting number divided by another accounting number this is the stuff of nightmares right because everything accountants do to one of those two numbers are not due to one of those two numbers it's going to screw up your roic you don't capitalize our r d you screw it up there you take a big restructuring charge you've screwed up your roic so I think it's a metric but it's a very flawed metric for mature companies that have settled in you can get away with it you try roic on Peloton what are you going to find it's going to be completely useless so it's a metric that I think is worth tracking because eventually if you compute it right you want it to be higher than the cost of capital now but getting it calculated right can be messy we'll come back and talk about roic corrections you have to do but one of the things I think we need to think about is how are Acquisitions playing out in that Ro I see because roic of acquisitive companies are going to be lower because you pay market value up front right you pay that's why people people try to correct for it by by netting out Goodwill okay but it's kind of a flawed correction so it's one of the many things you worry about with Ros s yes that's really most certainly there's no certainly around any cash so let's take the word certainly out everything is uncertain it's a Continuum right so you're saying this is even more uncertain than the usual Investments no so so what's the rest to this like creditors Union these numbers ultimately the money's got to come back one way or the other right you know what Facebook's biggest problem was or matters because I'm going to call them Facebook is they said they're going to spend 100 billion dollars in the Megabus so they gave us the bad news first but if you're an investor and you want to assess cash flows what do you need to know business in the metaverse are you going to do are you going to make money on transactions you're going to make money in subscriptions that was my biggest problem with Facebook is not that they spend 100 metaverse but they gave us almost nothing on what their business model was going to be the metaverse so I you could give them all the pain of the reinvestment but none of the ammunition to protect predict out any gain from it so guess what happened to Facebook stock price people assumed you'd reinvest 100 billion and they said you have no idea what you're doing otherwise you'd have told us so we're going to assume you're going to do nothing so you're right it's a job we constantly face we're trying to make our best judgments we make the best judgments we have to think through what is that investment mean what if Facebook has I hope they have thought about what their business model is no matter was then I can start to proceed to build it the expected earnings and cash flows from it it's going to be uncertain like everything else about the metaverse but I have to do it otherwise you know there's no way you can invest in a company that's making bets in the future yeah yes accountants do it for you in big bundles you know how good Goodwill gets impaired right they admit they screwed up and then they write it off right so it used to be that it used to be a constant amortization until the 2001 you wrote it off over 40 years equal amounts now it's done this this it's keep accountants employed because basically every year they've got to come back they've got to reassess your Goodwill and if it's gone down in value not if it's gone up in value they've gone down in value they can impair the good world so it happens and it's usually an admission of a screw-up and a past acquisition but the physical assets will get depreciated right the physical assets required will get into your into your depreciable base talk about working capital accounting definition of working capital is current assets minus current liabilities right like everything else I'm going to screw up the accounting definition evaluation the working cap and we're talking about is the difference between non-cash current assets and non-debt current libraries let me do the easier half of that first if you look at current liabilities what are the items you're going to see help me out cash is current assets so current libraries payables supplier credit short-term debt short-term portion of long term debt deferred this deferred that deferred something else okay I take the short term debt in the short-term portion of long term debt take them out of current liabilities and make them dead in my cost of capital so they're out so I can't count them because I've counted them as part of capital so what am I left with supplier credit accrued liabilities deferred taxes deferred this silicon let's go to the current asset side help me out here what am I going to see there here you'll see cash what else accounts receivable inventories and other current assets God only knows no short-term Investments usually don't show up as part of current assets is separate from those but you know sometimes they might but let's take inventory you know why we worry about inventory when we do cash flows because inventories are wasting asset what do I mean by that if you have a lot of inventory while it's sitting on the shelves you can't make money on it receivables are a wasting asset if you sell items on credit and you don't charge interest for it is cash a wasting acid oh let me rephrase it what has to be true for cash to be wasting us I'm sorry what did you say if it doesn't generate interest it's almost there but if you are in Europe three years ago there was no inflation there should be so if it doesn't earn a fair rate of return you're saying what's a fair rate of return well cash is investing usually liquid and short-term Investments right so right now if you have cash you'll be earning about 4.7 you know how I know because just last week I bought a six-month table where I locked in a four if I can do it on the treasury auction a company with 10 billion should be able to do it so if cash is invested at 4.8 percent it's earning a fair rate of return you can't compare the acoustic Apple because this is riskless in liquid so if your cash is invested in commercial paper and tables it's not a wasting asset you know 50 years ago if you had cash in your balance sheet it was actually a wasting asset you had to even large companies invested their cash in Banks and checking accounts sometimes with no interest because they said what else can we do that is a wasting us when you earn below Market rates or leave your cash some place where you know you're not earning interest if you have a CFO it's a hundred billion dollar cash balance it's left it in a checking account I check his house for toasters maybe he's getting a lot of toasters and that's why it's chosen the bank but the next thing I do is fire the guy right because you shouldn't be having that much cash wasting away my rule of thumb now with companies if you have a significant enough cash balance you probably are investing in a fair market rate of return cash is not a wasting asset unless I know what kind of business you'd have to be in for cash to be wasting asset maybe you are running a cocaine debt and you need a lot of cash sitting around because you got to use cash I mean I don't want to value a business to begin with because I'd be worried about the consequence of getting evaluation and wrong but I can't think of a legitimate business where you're going to have a 10 billion or 15 billion or 20 billion dollar cash as part of working capital it's not a wasting asset so don't get caught up in one of the most wasteful arguments in valuation which is people say is it an OP is it operating cash or non-operating cash I don't care the question we have is it wasting cash or non-wasting cash if you're Walmart you need four billion dollars in cash and operations but you keep that four billion investment tables and Commercial paper I don't care that you need it for operations this is not about liquidating your company it's about is it a wasting ass so I take cash out of current so when you look at working capital a few things before we leave working out the first is if you if you want to you can break working capital into detail you know what I mean by that right receivables inventory pay I have never in my lifetime ever broken working capital to detail partly because I have I'm incapable of forecasting days receivable within the next 30 Years if you can by all means break things down but don't do it just because you can so don't break working capital detail unless you feel your information on those levels of detail second it's an incredibly volatile item changes in working capital are notorious for jumping from positive to negative which means if you take last year's change in working capital and you make it your basis for forecasting cash flows you might be doing some very strange things what can you do to fix it average things over time I actually take working capital as a percent of revenues because it's a much more stable predictable number and easier number to forecast on and about 25 percent of U.S companies now have negative working capital a lot of software companies for instance because their business models are built around negative working capital and that creates a creates a strange phenomenon where as you grow working capital becomes a source of cash rather than the use of cash don't fight it it can happen you'll have other reinvestments that make up for it but you have business models that are negative working capital models you can actually generate cash as you grow from working capital so none of those are a game changer so as you go through your cash flows keep those in mind which brings me to free cash flow equity when you think about freecast as equity and you think about the difference from cash flow firm the key is these are cash flows left over for Equity investors now often had long arguments about how do you measure potential divot because that's what we're trying to measure I've seen analysts say well earnings are potential dividends and you can see that reasoning right if a company wanted to they could pay all their earnings artist dividends 200 percent of their earnings as divided they can liquidate themselves but they usually say earnings can be paid out as dividends I've seen people discount earnings back to the present for banks and financial service companies saying I don't know what capex is but earning some potential dividends if you go down that road I won't fight you when you use a hundred percent of earnings as dividends but I will fight you and use a five percent growth rate on those earnings you see why if you take all your earnings and pay it out of dividends how the heck can your earnings keep growing at five percent a year so not only are earnings not payable they're not cash flows earnings are not potential dividends what a potential dividends potential Dividends are cash flows left over after you've met every conceivable need the way I describe free cash flow equities think like the owner of a business you're sitting in front of a cash till and every time you have a payment do you pay it out every time you cash goes I mean they go into the top it's the cash left in the till at the end of the year after you've met every conceivable need working capital reinvestment debt payments it's whatever is left over so measuring free cash for Equity is perhaps the easiest thing to do in finance because it comes out of one financial statement you know it's statement you're going to focus on if you're trying to estimate free cash flow equity just go to the statement of cash flows everything is right there I'm going to take a statement of cash flows and reorient it to my needs but basically everything is coming out of the statement of cash flows to get to free cash flow Equity I'm going to start with net income why because it's an equity cash flow I'm going to start with Equity income I'm going to subtract our net capex and change in working capital the change in working capital will be in the in the operating cash flow section the net capex will be in the investing section and then I'm going to look at the financing section to see if I borrowed money which is a cash inflow or repaid money which is a cash card so start with net income I subtract out reinvestment I take that effective debt I come up with a free cash flow equity that is my potential dividend I can pay it out I call it potential dividend because I can pay it out without damaging the company I've already reinvested so you can't say I'm cutting back on reinvestment I've already paid my lenders this is my potential dividend so let's seems like a free lunch right you're boring money paid but if you're a growing company remember new debt is also if your debt did not grow because if you're the debt you borrowed doesn't exceed the debt you repay and you're growing company what's going to happen to your debt ratio over time your company will get bigger your debt will stay fixed your debt ratio will go down a healthy growing company should generally have a net debt inflow every year because if you don't you're going to become an all-equity funded company over time and that might be your plan but if you're growing you keep your debt ratio fixed which is what you've done in your cost of capital you're in effect assuming that there'll be debt borrowed every year to keep up with the growth of the company to keep that debt ratio stable so it seems like a free lunch the equity investor is borrowing money and paying it out as a dividend money is fungible it goes all over the place so the way to think about is I'm taking the net debt covering some of my reinvestment with debt which reduces my drag as an equity investor and therefore I have more cash flows available to me as an equity investor if you're a shrinking firm then we can argue that maybe this is not you know in a shrinking form you should expect debt repay to exceed that you bring in but in a growing firm you should bring in more debt than you repair okay so go to your statement of cash flows for your company go through the items as I said everything's there except for acquisition to pay forward stock and that's why they're tricky because you go to the footnotes you got to look at what they did but the free cash flow Equity is your potential dividend okay there's actually a neat little trick in the statement of cash flows that you can use to check your free cash flow equity now what's here what's the end game in a statement of cash flows what do accountants use it to explain the change in your cash balance right if you take the change in your cash balance and add the dividends and the BuyBacks you did that year you're almost going back to the free cash flow equity in a different direction so try it out take the change in your cash balance take the dividends paid and the BuyBacks that tell you you put them together you're getting a free cash flow Equity going in the other direction get comfortable with the statement of cash flows to me it is the most honest financial statement there because it's about cash in cash out you really can't play as many games with the statement of cash closes you can do with an income statement or a balance sheet and learning a potential dividend is critical so let's see what we have is free cash flow Equity start with net income you subtract out reinvestment and if you are using that maybe you get a cash inflow from debt or cash outflow let's go through the life cycle and said see what will happen to the free cash flow equity you're a young company startup maybe even a young toddler company what does your net income look like probably a net loss here are all your futures in growth your reinvestment is huge and odds are you're not borrowing money if you're sensible right so there's no cash flow from that so it's a free cash flow deck would look like big negative number it's called cash but it's a feature not a bug with young companies as you mature as a company as you grow your net income is going to go from A Loss to a profit but it's still a high Growth Company you're still a big reinvestment needs so just because you've turned the corner and profits doesn't mean your free cash flow Equity is turned that will take a little while so your free cash flow Equity is going to lag your income it's only as growth starts to level off that if free cash flows Equity are going to turn positive you see why because as your growth levels off you're not reinvesting as much as you did before your existing Investments are starting to bear fruit in terms of profits your free cash flows Equity turned positive I could use this as a graph of when companies should start paying dividends right because as you mature you're going to see a free cash flows to equity kind of become more positive and get more positive and then you're going to decline the company starts to shrink again I think this is all very abstract I tried this on Tesla it's actually a pretty interesting story because you know as you know I've been valuing Tesla since 2013 when I started as a young startup huge money losing company the green I'm sorry the green numbers here are the net income numbers so it's been money losing for much of its life it's free cash flows Equity we're actually much more negative than its net income which makes sense right because you're losing money of reinvestment it actually turned the corner far sooner than I thought it would you got to give Elon Musk and Tesla credit when I looked in 2018 I didn't think they would turn the corner to 2023-24 they turn the corner very quickly in 2020 you see for the first time they're making a profit the free cash load Equity was actually zero that's why it's not there 2021 you got net income of 5.5 billion free cash flow Equity of 2.3 bill as Tesla matures here's what you can expect to see net income growth is going to start level up free cash flows Equity are going to climb towards net income right because your reinvestment is going to drop off there's nothing special about young growth companies just have to figure out where they are in the life cycle and graft them out of attack so if you get a chance try this for your company especially if it's a company that's if you take a craft answer Coca-Cola it'll be pretty boring right net income free cash flow Equity pretty much the same every year your company evolving over time you should see the net income and the free cash flow Equity right in fact one of the indicators I used to figure out where a company's life cycle is I look at the net income and the free cash flow Equity if the two numbers are catching up with each other you're probably reaching the mature face of your life cycle if the net income is running way ahead of your free cash flow equity that means you're probably growing but if the free cash flow Equity is higher than your net income you're probably starting the declining phase so it's actually an indicator you can use to detect where your company is in the life cycle so it started last start of every year I compute these numbers for every company so what I did it started 2023 we went and looked at the net income in the aggregate for companies every publicly traded company by part of the world so there's a net income I completed the free cash for that quitting the accurate because the numbers that I need are all there in fact if you look there are China free cash flow equities actually negative in the aggregate by itself does that trouble mean no not necessarily you've got a growing economy maybe you're reinvesting a lot okay I also look at the dividends and BuyBacks and the interesting thing is I actually change the stable from your graphs I'll send you this table is I computed the percentage of cash flows that Equity investors in each region of the world get from BuyBacks and you can see it this is something that now well established for the last 20 or 30 years the US has 64 percent but the US is not alone this is something you're starting to see more and more of the world a greater percentage of the cash returned takes a form of BuyBacks many parts of the world the cash return if you think of dividends plus BuyBacks is well in excess of free cash flow Equity U.S for instance in 2022 at 231 billion in free cash flow Equity they returned 1.5 trillion in dividends and BuyBacks remember I said you could use net income versus free cash flow Equity as a measure where companies in the life cycle you can also get a sense of where a country is in the life cycle about how much cash is getting returned to investors relative to what's being put back one of the most drug troubling components in the US has been the amount of cash that's being returned relative to the cash being put you know that's actually available suggests that you know this long-term shrinkage happening at companies perhaps in sectors where disruption is happening but you're you know this table kind of gives you an indication of how much companies could return so I'm going to stop there on after the quiz we'll complete the free cash flow Equity calculation especially how leverage can play out in free cash flow equity and uh talk about growth rates whatever the stock quote is like the history of never paying dividends which are you going to use you know so sometimes the brand controls are absolutely noises in the right place the right time sometimes your comedians he went to pushing me when you become so you define branding uh pricing Powers so 95 of 100 companies that played with another brand new remember to talk to you at a brand new then and likely charged at the time I can charge to say advice you know by definition your profits will be hidden away sold the name and captured Sarah it's valid anticipated in the SEC yeah and I'm convention because the person's buying the brand name would get the pricing part not the person holding the serum that basically means that brand name has less to do it keeps in these consumer product companies with brand name is the biggest version less to do with what your product does or what people think about your product but it's part of quantity but this and that's why it's almost mystical about how it gets created right we don't have a template or this is how you create a valuable brand you can throw hundreds of millions of dollars of ads and have nothing to show for it you can get a magical brand name out of nothing but you know once you've acquired a brand name you don't want to let it go because you know it it has a lot it's the same part yeah right people working but at some point even brand day right crowded Heinz kind in the same extensions of consumers age so nobody wants liquid cheese they need you know the crowd of times it goes you know and I think about aging Brands yeah it doesn't mean the margin they're going to draw but it means they're not getting the growth of the month so basically like tobacco right yeah you're gonna have people who drink Coca-Cola I mean I think Warren Buffett's children's Coca-Cola and sits on the you know they're going to be completely in Coca-Cola for the rest of their life but they don't have a whole lot of life now yeah yeah so I think brand name is yeah but it's because of that permanent value not necessary and Scottish but it has a great escape by the most of the competitors we have different Industries where the ability to invest in a brand is easier it also depends on the kind of consumers you're getting apparently businesses brand names have lesser value because they've paid much more could be their fat right so today you want Zara tomorrow you want something else and it's been a special it depends on how young your young customer base is tend to have lesser brand name power than all the customer bases because younger customers are more likely to switch so if you ask me to accept the valuable brand name I'm going to examine who you sell yourself to what kind of customers do you have hello how much you know is there the more initiative in the process the greater the value and I think that it will vary across even within businesses are there and I think you know if you look at um nightsing versus some startup shoe company you might be very different yeah size the market and and I think it also depends on how much of your products real benefits come from not what the product is offering but the psychological I mean let's face Coca-Cola sugar water crap yeah that's right there's really nothing special about a carbonated soda and so the reality for almost all of the valley for a Cookie Ball that comes from spread none of it comes from servers with apple You could argue that the chunk of the value comes from your operating system from this dialing there is so the more substance there is to your product uh the less you worry about your brand name being the one that disappears the less substance the more you have to think about it it's all brand new so the mystery disappears it's like you know Wizard of Oz they're going to evaluate examples you get the tax benefit because you choose where to borrow and you make sure you borrow in those parts on the world we're going to get the tax 25 tax but wouldn't make sense your understanding your tax benefit because you choose where to borrow so apple is revenues in other countries they'll never borrow another countries they borrow in the US to get the maximum offense that they can from the dead yeah um there's no problem just get two or three years of financials in here and then you your valuation will be more dependent on looking at industry averages or public companies you want to get a sense of with my margin than usual and of course you've got the country as well which is not alcohol is a unique markets you have to think about what what are you competitive advantages in Morocco and uh you know by the other business model that works that and perhaps even us because it's something that is scalable and you know that you could move into other countries and go after other countries is it North Africa you're talking about are you talking about Europe I mean potential markets so it requires a story that you will tell for your company would reflect how ambitious the owners of the company are how willing to take risks outside the domestic marketing because it would be risk they're more unknowns and um obviously willing to reinvest um right right you don't get the cash because the end of the year you get them over the course of the year the middle of the year is probably closed surgery but from if you want to convert traditional entity evaluation to Media evaluation you know all you have to do get the value multiply by one plus three across the capital raised to the power of 0.5 you've effectively done what those guys did with all their media because that's all the effect is right the half your discount rate effect the problem with materials in the nectar 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 but people think somehow it's more precise because you're sticking with metal gear from present by the standpoint so you need to make something in the evaluation yeah do a retail company as long as you have a whole Year's financials in there it is what it is right you you're capturing the Christmas season in your Revenue the fact that you're putting it at the end of the rod in the middle of the year you would argue is actually a unpread the retail companies because they're actually loaded towards the end of the year rather than the middle of the year so we could play this timing game although all over but I don't think it's worth it foreign they have to come down I don't know where they are I am here they are they're those things right there yeah but they have to come down right so how do you get this down that's what I was going on too because to me it has to do something that has to do with the uh the system oh okay so we just can't pull around right you know so really it's gonna come let me just confirmative it's time for a few minutes on the computer down yeah I'm not touching this I can't yeah mm-hmm I don't really have a clue if I get it down so I'm not even going there should I call Caroline and ask her yeah yeah is it worth it is working let them know we do and I do what you would ask but right that's what I know where he is before we get it down um thank you very much really you're not able to get balanced down are you really as we see them they're like up here don't cut like if you don't know how to do it don't worry you don't do this right I got it there [Music] foreign in person yeah their face all right here's another thing what's going on um um foreign foreign thank you apparently foreign foreign thank you okay thanks foreign response it's gonna be any worse um foreign [Music] everybody sorry you know she died thank you um thank you foreign thank you guys thank you very much thank you everybody's wondering do you happen to know like when the final exam would do this talks about me okay thanks 
foreign so here's what's going to happen one of the Tas will come down in about five minutes take those quizzes up to be alphabetically sorted and once I finished my second class the second class ends at 4 45 let's start grading that's great this quiz first and once it's graded I will let you know that it's been great and you can pick it up I'm not going to hand it out in class it's incredible waste of time and you can pick it up on the ninth floor of kmac it'll be outside face down in alphabetical order right that's why I asked you to write your name in the back because I don't browse this is Barnes Noble so basically you know where your name is alphabetically you shouldn't be saying I don't know where it is I've looked through every Quest it look I'll be phased up so I know for some of you this might be an incredible invasion of privacy so if you feel exposed because your quiz is going to be out there let me know and I will keep the quiz in my office the downside then is you got to find me in my office to get the quiz so if you want to get your quiz back you'll probably have sooner than you think from me okay so watch your email and when I send the email I will send a solution then I won't send it right now because I know exactly what will happen if you get the solution now is all these dire scenarios will play out you'll be convinced you got only two on the quiz because you don't think any partial credit is going to matter so I'm going to hold off till you have your quizzes and you can check it against the solution and I tell you I make mistakes so check the solution if I screw it up bring it in I would love to tell you that mistakes on both sides will be brought to me but this is a very asymmetric gig which is mistakes in your favor will probably get exposed in mistakes will not get exposed mistakes that don't work against you you're going to bring to me that's fine I understand that but um I will put the solutions out there'll be little uh when I say when I send the Excel spreadsheet on the solution there'll be a grading template so you can see how many points I took off oh it should be pretty transparent so if you lose a point and a half it should specify exactly where you lost the point and happen and unless I've overlooked something maybe you wrote on the back of the page and you never I never looked at it for the most part it should be directly related to what you did on the quest okay okay so let's go back to where we were the end of the last class we were just finishing up with free cash flow equity pre-castrated equities remember it's cash flows left over after debt payments and we did the full calculation right net income minus reinvestment and then we had these cash flows to and from debt that issuance is minus debt repaired shortcut that can sometimes be used keyword is sometimes and that shortcut can be used only if you're willing to make an assumption the Assumption has to be that you're willing to keep a debt ratio that is stable and fixed from this point on so let's suppose you tell me that from this day on you're going to finance 25 of your reinvestment from that here's the shortcut you can use to get the free cash flow I'm going to start with net income subtract out the 75 of the net capex that comes from Equity because after all as an equity investor all you care about is how much do I have to come up with subtract out the 75 percent of the change in working capital you're saying what happened to that debt issuance and debt repayments if your debt ratio is stable remember all debt repayments are going to be covered by new debt because if you replace them with Equity or debt ratio will change this basically allows the debt to increase as your company grows so it keeps your debt ratio stable over time mature companies if you ever actually estimate free cash flow Equity you can get away with this approach because of debt ratio is stable let me try this the company I'm going to use to illustrate this is a company I've been using in my corporate finance class for a long time and this is my very first edition of the book when I was doing it in 98 or 99. I was trying to compute a free cash flow equity for this so let me go through the numbers net income of 1.533 billion dollars net capex was 612 million difference between capex and depreciation and working capital increased by 477 million so netcap X is 612 working capital increases by 477 million that debt ratio was about 25 so basically I'm sorry 24 percent 23.83 to be precise let's assume they're going to maintain that debt ratio from this day on the start of net income subtract out the portion of equity which is 76 of equity of 612 million 76 of 477 million is 363 million I subtract those are I come up with the free cash flow Equity of 704 million you can try the full approach in fact take this and you work out the full approach you should get exactly the same number if you put a dollar debt issuance in dollar debt repayment it's just a shortcut that works if your debt ratio is stays good so it's not a different equation it's the same equation that simplifies because you have a stable debt ratio any questions in the mechanics here so it basically makes forecasting easier because all you have to do is forecast net income net cap exchanges working cap and then give me a debt ratio you don't have to debt issuances into payments which are a pain in the neck to forecast because you got to decide when that comes to you what debt you're going to whether you're going to issue debt or not this saves you the trouble I'm going to take this calculation and play a little game the debt ratio I'm using here is 23.83 right let's assume I used a 30 that ratio as an equity investor tell me what this does to your free cash flow Equity so take a look at the equation starting today I'm going to issue 30 percent your net income is unaffected because that's based on what you've already borrowed right if I'm borrowing 30 or 23 24 percent the equity portion that I have to come up with gets smaller my free cash flow Equity gets paid that seems too good to be true if I raise my debt ratio my free cash flow Equity keeps climbing and climbing and climbing and you're saying this is good value of equity is tied to free cash or Equity free cash flow Equity gets higher if my debt ratio gets higher my value of equity should go up that can't be right what am I missing here this is half the equation I'm looking at cash flows these are free cash flows Equity to Value Equity what do I need to Discount those cash flows at the cost of equity what drives the cost of equity what's the only input that's company specific in the cost of energy the beta right because there is free rate and the risk premium are Market set numbers and how do we estimate betas we look at the business you're in and we lever the beta up right based on your debt to equity ratio do you see the other shoe waiting to drop as I raise my debt ratio my cash flow Equity will increase real estate developers know this right they keep talking about how much they will benefit from borrowing money you're right your return Equity will go up your free cash flow Equity per share will go up but guess what your cost of equity is also going up and the net effect is what's going to determine the value so my last question on the free cash and Equity calculation is about the net effect so let's summarize increasing your debt ratio increases your free cash flow Equity increasing your debt ratio also increases your cost of equity your discount rate is rising your cash flows Rising I'm going to read a series of statements and you tell me whether this is the way to think about that in the context of value first statement is that increasing leverage will increase value because the cash flow effect will always dominate the discount rate if that were true I would be every where should every company end up at 99 that right so that can't be true otherwise leverage would be this gift that keeps on giving how about the second stable increasing leverage will decrease value because the discount rate effect will always dominate the cash flow effect if that were true no company should ever borrow money what about the third one it's very strange statement but hang in there increasing leverage will not affect my value because my cash flow effect will be exactly offset but my by my Discord trade in fact since I'm highly familiar from your corporate finance class let's remember Miller Modigliani somewhere in your corporate finance class you talked about Melanie right it's this homage you pay in finance right great gods of Finance Martin Miller and Franco modularity but what's a mathematical energy theorem sir okay that's the assumption but what's the conclusion of the model that the value of the firm is going to be unaffected by that and people are always mystified how can that be in a world where your cash flow effects are exactly offset by your discount rate effect you know what that word would have to look like there could be no taxes because taxes still the scales and there can be no default risk because default risk still if you take those two big things out you essentially will end up with your cost to Capital staying the same no matter what your debt ratio is it's not magical because your cost of capital is not the cost of raising money it's a risk in your operations at driving it right changing a mix of debt and Equity can't change that risk so fundamentally Miller and frankly are pointing out something that people Miss which is playing games with your debt ratio is not making your company more or less valuable unless the government lends you a helping hand and that's what taxes do all puts in a penalty which is what bankruptcy does so in a word with no taxes and no default risk your cash flow effects will be done offset exactly by your discount rate but that's not the world I live in I don't think that's a word you live in we live in a world of taxes we're approaching tax day and I haven't done my taxes yet and I'm sure you all have to do your taxes as well and we live in a world with default risk right companies go bankrupt they're unable to make debt payments in that word increasing leverage will sometimes help you and would sometimes help you that's why we have an optimal debt ratio so if you do in corporate finance the way we do this is we're minimize minimizing the cost of capital this is another way to get to the same end game change your debt ratio see what happens to cash flow Equity see what happens to your discount rate compute the value of equity there will be a mix of debt and Equity at which your Equity value is maximized that is in a sense your optimal debtoration so that's it for cash flows talk about whether rabba meets the road up till now whenever you're asked to estimate something you can point to let's say accountant's fault I got the beta from the modern online there's always somebody else to blame now is the time to take ownership evaluation because you kind of reject out the future nobody cares what last year brought so I want to talk about what it is that drives growth but before I do that I want to put a statement on the table that I've said before but I want to re-emphasize there is a sense at least in investing that growth is good that high growth companies are better than low growth companies right when is the last time you heard somebody get on CNBC I really like this company it's got shrinking revenues growth is good not growing is bad and that's a very dangerous conclusion to reach because growth can add value growth can do nothing for value and growth can actually destroy that to understand the trade-off and bro let's think of the good side of growth the good side of growth is as you grow your revenues get larger your income gets larger cash flows get larger in the future what's a bad side of growth to get that growth you have to put money back into the business if you're a Manufacturing Company in plant and Equipment if you're a technology company in r d so what you're giving up are cash flows now for growth in the future and already you can see why sometimes the trade-off can work in your favor and sometimes it might not we'll come up with simple metrics for capturing whether growth is good or bad but I think this is something I want to put on the table because I you know when you look at the percentage of companies globally that actually destroy value while they grow it's just astonishingly large so clearly companies have taken this to heart we need to grow at any cost and you see companies say that we want to grow at any cost it's a horrifically bad objective because you can grow at any cost just go to Acquisitions every year you'll get bigger as a company but you'll get less valuable as a company so with that leading let's talk let's talk about the ways in which you can estimate growth generically when you have to estimate growth for your company and hopefully you've already picked it company I won't harass you anymore so your master list is the least populated of my three Masters right now so either you're holding your company mysterious you don't want to let me know you haven't picked a company I don't even want to go there if you haven't picked a company but once you've picked a cup and you got a forecast growth right look at the three places you go first you look at the past orological sense right if you're going to grow make a growth project you want to see how quickly your company has grown last three years last five years so we're going to start with what's called historical growth a fancy word let's look at history and let's see how quickly as our companies grow that sounds like it should be a fact right we're looking backwards if I ask you what's a historical growth rate for Coca-Cola for this room and you all came back next Monday with a growth trade we should all agree right but we would because there are choices you will make on what you know the time window you look at the metric you focus on is that revenues is it operating income is it rabbit diets net income even the way you estimate growth rate can make a difference you can use arithmetic averages or look at a compounded average so I'm going to start with historical growth look at how to estimate it and why you should be a little careful about just extrapolating pastor Feb you should be very glad that future growth cannot be extrapolated from past growth you know what if future growth is going to be extrapolated for fast growth why do you need a human being in this process chat GPT forget about chat GPT you've been able to do this for four years just take an Excel spreadsheet make every line item growth past growth rates you're done right but that's a good place to start look at historical growth but you're going to be you know when you look at that historic growth you're going to say I don't know whether I'm right I don't know much about this company I just picked this company two weeks ago I've never done a valuation before the second way we estimate growth is we Outsource you're not into outsources maybe we ask somebody else what growth rate should I use don't let that somebody else be me because I'm not going to give you an answer but in valuation you constantly look outwards you know what most private company appraisers you know where they get their growth rates for their earnings and revenues they get it from the management of the companies they've had they go to ask mentioned how quickly can you grow talk about bias forecast right but this way if something goes wrong they say the managers gave me this number I just use those numbers if you're wearing a publicly traded company you look for experts people who spend all their time looking at these companies in public markets you know those people are right you're well in Coca-Cola there are 55 animals cell side equity research Iris whose entire life is focused on forecasting earnings in Coca-Cola you might think that they know more than you do you're mistaken but you might think that they do and use their growth rates as a substitute saying look I don't know much about the company but they much so we'll talk about analyst estimates of growth and whether they come in closer to earnings and using some time series model so you can look at the past you can Outsource your growth rate or you can go back to the business because ultimately you and I don't have the power to go around endowing companies with high growth just because we like them growth has to be earned what does that mean to grow you got to pull off this trick of reinvesting money and reinvesting well at the same time you know why it's a trick it's easy to reinvest a lot of money anybody can do it but if you reinvest a lot of money often you're earning a lot of touch it's easy to earn a higher return if you pick only one project a year and just say I'm going to suspect what project here but to pull off this trick of reinvesting a lot and reinvesting well at the same time is what creates quality growth we're going to create this what I call a sustainable growth equation and it's not an equation it forces you to think about the business how much it's reinvesting how well it's reinvesting and coming up with the growth based on that so let's start with historical roots today getting past numbers for any company's trivia I hope you've signed up for s p Capital like you're another nag I've made now but let let it hang out there if you haven't done it you could pull the last you know if you if it's Coca-Cola you can put that entire lives early Going Back 40 50 years in one Excel spreadsheet think about what the choices are that you make that can affect what you end up with as a broker the first is I said purely statistical choice if I gave you 10 years of earnings for a company and say what growth rate did this company have over those last 10 years you can compute an arithmetic average you know what that did was take a growth rate each year add the numbers up divide by 10. or you could look at a geometry average or a compounded growth rate we take the earnings in 10 years ago the earnings today you don't need any of the intermediate numbers they say what growth rate would get me from where I was 10 years ago to what I am today there are people who actually bring in you know heavy ammunition into this game they bring in regression models but basically they're doing pretty much the same thing do I want an arithmetic average or a compounded average second the time period you put can affect your growth rate if you weren't sure really high growth rate for your company the easiest way to do it is to pick a base year that was a terrible year you take 2020 as your base year for a hotel it's going to look amazing because you had nothing in revenues that you're in your billion dollars you could say that's a hundred percent growth right the time period matters and the metric you're looking at also matters are you looking at revenues or operating income growth in earnings is a meaningless statement unless you tell me is it operating income is it net income is it ebitda can get very different growth rates and finally there are these mechanical issues that we sometimes Overlook when we think about growth rates we think growth rates are always going to be calculated that they're you know let me give you an example we're going to run into an issue let's suppose you have a company that is minus a hundred million in that income last year as a plus 100 million is net income this year I challenge you to tell me what the growth rate in this company was we know it is a good year right minus 100. think about it what's the growth rate you would give this company I'm going to take you to the mechanics of computer growth rate and you're going to get a completely counter-intuitive number if you just plug the numbers and we use for typical growth rates we have to talk about how do we deal with negative numbers to come up with growth right we also have to deal with the fact that as companies scale up their growth trades will decrease it's almost a mathematical given when you have a dollar income doubling that income is not a big deal when you have a billion dollars a hundred percent growth rate is a lot of income so we're going to talk about that scaling issue and how to bring that in when you estimate growth so let's start with the first of these questions talk about the medic averages versus geometric averages first reaction most people have is how different can they be so I took this as a very old example a Motorola the late 90s at five years sick five years of growth rates in revenues have a dynamic I'm showing you three different metrics I've completed the arithmetic average just add the numbers up and divide by five and the geometric average which is basically take the ending number and the starting number and then you know you know how to compute the geometric averages take the ending and the starting number and raise it to the power one-fifth basically because it's a compounded growth rate let's take revenues the arithmetic average is 7.08 the geometric average is 6.82 already is saying what a waste of time I'm pretty close to the same number you're right with revenues we were pretty close if you go to ebitda there are medical average is 10.9 percent the geometric average is 5.39 I'm getting twice the growth rate when I use the nearest mini garage and when I go to Ebbitt my arithmetic average is 42.45 my geometry average is around four I'm getting 10 times as higher growth rate why as I shift metrics there's actually a statistical reason why the arithmetic average in geometric average and diverging to see what that reason is think about the only condition when they will give you the same answer what has to be true about your growth rate for arithmetic and geometric averages to exactly match up they have to be the same the more standard deviation there is the volatility there's the growth rate is the bigger the Divergence there will be between arithmetic and geometric averages that's why what stalker does I made such a big deal about compounding geometric averages because stock returns are incredibly noisy with tables it doesn't make that much of a difference there's not that much variance so as you go down the income statement you have to be more and more careful about whether you so if somebody's telling you growth rate for a company stop them and say first what did what grow what earnings are you looking at earnings per share after early Warriors and arithmetic average or a geometric average because you can get wildly different numbers second let's talk about money losing to money matter now Time Warner in the late 90s was coming off a big lbo they had a lot of debt they were losing money in fact they went from an earnings per share of minus five cents but they turned the corner to a earnings per share of 25 cents before we compute growth rates this is good right you went from negative to positive let's assume you compute growth rates mechanically the way you compute growth rates is you take the change in earnings and you divide by the earnings per share last year it always if I use that measure for growth my change in earnings is 30 cents what goes in my denominator minus 25 cents um minus five cents which gives me a growth rate of minus 600 already that's starting not to make sense right I had a really good year and there's a minus in front of my growth rate is there an easy way to fix it yeah just take the pencil board that way it becomes plus that's one trick that people play when they have negative to positive is they use the absolute value of last trade you put a mathematical spin on it looks more sophisticated than just drawing a lot but makes minus 600 to plus 600 percent here's the second trick you can draw what's the problem here is the numerator or the denominator denominator right what if I took the higher of the two numbers and put in my you know you can see we're really playing games here but if I took the higher the two numbers I'll take the 30 cents and divide by the 25 cents I get 120 percent you can already see that when you go from negative to positive while I can try every conceivable game here the bottom line is the growth rate becomes almost useless because remember the reason we're Computing growth is to project out the future minus 600 doesn't work plus 600 doesn't work plus 120 does it you're saying what would work how about nmf the most honest way not nmf is not meaningful it's better to say look there is no meaningful growth rate when I go from negative to positive I can't use historical growth still have other ways of estimating growth it's better to not try to estimate growth when you have these mechanical issues so when you think about about negative earnings don't give up but at the same time recognize that that growth rate you get might not be a number you wanted one final thing you know at least caveat about pastoral let's say of a young company it's a small company that's actually had a very good five or ten year period you look at its growth rate over the last five or ten years and you you do things carefully you compute a compounded average growth so you're following all the rules you come up with a really high number and then you feel tempted by saying look this company is still good it's got great management it still has a great product I'm just going to extrapolate that growth for the next five years be careful what you can create you can create monsters with growth rates are extraordinary I'm going to illustrate this with a company called Callaway golf was a company that came out of nowhere to become one of the most successful golf companies or sporting companies in the early 90s you know what they're the product that launched them into Fame was right but now it's golf ball so when you say caliber people say God but the original product was the Big Bertha which was a golf club and the thing about golf is everybody is terrible at golf but they're always convinced that it's because they have the wrong club or the wrong ball or the wrong Pro or the wrong I mean you blame something else which is great for merchandising because look if you buy the big Berta you're going to play like Tiger Woods took off and to show you how much it took off this was the five-year historical date I was looking at in 1997 when I looked at Callaway ball their net income went from 1.8 million to 122 12.3 million so let's start with facts did they have a great five years absolutely they're compounded rotary the geometry cabinet was 102 percent here they're still run by the same people they still have the golf club saying why can't I just use 102 for the next five years because this is what will happen to your net income if you do effectively we all even we don't play golf we'll have to buy big birthdays and put them in our closets maybe as Weapons every American will be required to own a golf club and it has to come from you can see the story is frayed but in a sense using high growth rates can sometimes lead you to numbers you look and say there is no way my company can do that so start by looking at past growth rates but be careful it's not a fact there are estimation judgments you're making and for most companies historical growth is not a great predictor of future growth in fact now one of my favorite studies partly because of the title of the study in the early 60s the Englishman comes over and gets a PhD in economics at one of the one of the what are the US universities and he writes a thesis an anesthesis he was examining the question it was a very simple question he said can I use past earnings growth as a predictor of future earnings growth remember those days you didn't have huge databases so what he did was he took the growth rate from 1950 through 55 in earnings for every company and 56 or 690s for every company and he was like if I know the earnings from 50 to 55 how well does it help me forecast 56 or 60 earnings growth the earnings historical growth is a great predictor of future growth what should you expect to see as a correlation High positive and even if it's not high positive High earnings growth should lead to high earnings growth I I won't give away what he found I'll give you the title of his paper it's one of my favorite research you know titles ever called the title of his PhD thesis was higgledy piggledy broth you know what he found is a correlation what's your worst case scenario if you're using historical role negative one would be great because then what you do is you take whatever the past growth is you put a you know you go to the other end of the spectrum your worst scenario is it's close to zero which is which is what he found you know when you see these Investment Banking valuations where everything is forecast using historical growth numbers maybe you should buy copies of higgledy Piggly growth now you don't even have to read it right leave it on the bookshelf it'll be a reminder to be cautious when you keep extrapolating past growth so start with passgold don't get too dependent on it because it is not a great predictor feature so let's move on to equity research I'll wait it no matter what company you pay it could be the most obscure emerging every company now in the world seems to have equity research analysis in fact if you have access to Capital IQ or you go on Ibis and you know zax you can get forecasted earnings growth for your company it seems like a godsend when you value a couple there's a growth rate right there But first you have to remember what analysts forecast growth analysts don't forecast growth and revenues they don't even forecast growth in abide they forecast growth in earnings per share that's the metric islands are most focused on but it's true analysts spend all of their time tracking 15 or 20 companies and it's true that they spent a great deal of their time forecasting earnings per share in future periods so today would be a much better than the rest of us and I mean think of the resources they have the time they have therefore passive earnings per share must be much better than some time series model or just looking at the past right I'm going to show you the research on analyst forecast and it's a little depressing especially if you're a sales are at equity research analysts so think of the tens of millions of dollars we spend on South Side equity research all the time going to forecasting I'll start with the good news when you look at that forecast of earnings one way to measure the quality of a forecast look at how different it is from actual earnings so if you get perfect forecast the standard error view of the difference should be close to zero in other words you're always kind so you want this number to be as low as possible it's been studies over time last 50 years probably 10 15 studies and compare analysts forecast of earnings with time series models with chat GPT or AI could do or in just a computer can focus the good news is if you look at one quarter head forecast you know what I mean by one quarter next quarter's earnings analysts forecasts are better than time series models but barely the difference is the standard error of a Time series model might be 32 percent the analyst forecast is at 28 not at zero percent or two percent but at 28 you'll buy yourself a four percent Improvement in forecast with all the tens of millions of dollars you say I'm okay with that that's one quarter ahead if you go go to two quarters ahead even that Advantage disappears five years forecast just looks like a Time series model so I actually present this to equity research analyst and they don't like it but it is what it is you know what their excuses right if it's New York based they say a lot of very bad cell side equity research analysts out there none of them are in this room they're bringing down the quality of your focus if you focused in on the very best equity research analyst I'm sure they do much better so I said okay I'll focus on the very best equity research address you know how football you've got these All-American teams where they go in and pick in each position you know sales at equity research analysts that are all America teams institutional investors been doing this for 40 years where they're going to each sector and they pick the All-America analyst in that sector if you're a self-site equity research that is this is the Pinnacle of your life there's no further up you've got Mount Everest you hit the you know all America see in fact once you become an All-America analyst it becomes part of your name you're no longer Joe Brown you're Joe Brown all-americans that's how you introduce yourself to others to your own family you ask your kids to call you just all America for short you know because you want to remind everybody I'm an All-American and there are studies that look at these all-americans they're the best of the Lord they must be better right and they find something very strange and maybe you can explain this too they look at the forecast areas of these all American Airlines in the year before they become All-American so you know what they find they're actually a little worse than the typical apps and then they look at them the year after and something magical happens they're a little better than the typical animals think this is self-esteem playing hard you become a better forecaster if you think more of yourself I don't think so what do you think happens after you become an All-America analyst it might make you a better forecaster more conservative conservative will mean you're under shooting right conservative can doesn't necessarily mean that you're making a better forecast more access to management remember the only Advantage you get as a sales side analyst is these little twinges of information remember in the U.S it's illegal for companies to actually give you explicit information as a sell-side analyst if you're not giving it to the market and companies enforce it pretty strongly because the SEC can very quickly crack down so you got to get people little little nuggets which are not quite information things like our shelves are getting empty and then you read in whatever the rest you want to read into it if you're Joe Brown equity research analyst you call Coca-Cola they say who are you again oh Joe Brown we'll get back to you hang up the phone you Joel Brown All-American let me get the CEO for you because he might want to talk to you their access improves and there's another magical thing that happens you know an analyst put out buy and sell recommendations says a price effect because people are not people pick up on the buy they start buying as well they pick up and sell with all American analysts I'll tell you what the price effect is and maybe again you can explain the disparity when they put out by recommendations the stock goes up about three percent when they put out sell recommendations on the date of the recommendation the stock price drops about 4.7 using it makes sense but if you track these stocks about four six eight weeks after the recommendation by recommendations the three percent you got the recommendation day completely disappears but with cell recommendations it not only persists it actually gets worse in other words there seems to be a much more lasting price impact when you make a sell recommendation than when you make a buyer recommendation what do you think that is yes but had a cell recommendation this company must be in the verge of disaster because remember what we said you never say the word sell it's nine to one right nine buys forever just be twenty to what nine to one so the fact that you put out a cell recommendation must mean you're seeing things here that must be catastrophic second you are burning your Bridges right that must mean that there is something why you might pronounce it maybe the equity research ad has got a big dinner at you know whatever the most expensive restaurant in New York was and you put a buy recommendation on it you're not going to put a seller recommendation just because he got a big dinner because you think what you're leaving on the table so if you look at forecasting accuracy analysts are not bringing much there's a price effect but it's more on sales than buys which then raises the question why is this happening I mean we have all these I mean these are not surprisingly large number of people who go through this class have ended up at Southside equity research act I wouldn't name names in spite of all of my efforts to talk them out of doing it they've ended up a Southside equity research they're bright people they know evaluation so why aren't they adding more value so I've come up with a list of reasons if any of you are going to sell side equity research you have to fix these problems to make sales that equity research some kind of value-added proposition the first is tunnel vision remember ourselves had equity research works you put into a sector you're given 15 companies what are you told forget the rest of the world exists this is your universe That's not healthy in investing why because you get so focused on your 15 companies you forget the rest of the word is out there and here's how it plays out remember you're a.com analyst every company in your sector trades at 500 times revenues company comes along that trades at 300 times Revenue so you think it's an incredible bargain your perspective has been skewed so we you know what we need to do to fix this right I think we need to take away the sector Focus maybe rotate equity research analysts through sectors not only will this solve the tunnel vision problem it'll also mean you're less inclined to worry about what will the management think about me because I would work with these same 15 companies second you gotta a whole lot of lemmingitis in Southside equities the way sales at equity research works is they revise their remember I said they make earnings per share estimates sometimes you see a revision to address that an analyst said Goldman Sachs has raised the expected earnings per share for Tesla from 10 cents to 12 cents keep your eyes on the news no the news wise for the next three or four days you're going to get a whole bunch of other analysts also revise the earnings up because you want to be part of the crowd the third is what I call you know what I think of is a variation of the Stockholm syndrome remember the Stockholm syndrome of the 70s it was concocted to explain why a hostage after a while starts to identify more with the hostage takers than the people trying to rescue them I think it was in the aftermath of The Paddy Hearst kidnapping in the early 70s he said what's that got to do with equity research if you think about equity research objectively your job as a sales ad analyst is to be objective look at a company say is it being run right is it fairly priced at some point in time though the relationship becomes so blurred that the equity research actually seems to think it's his or her job to defend the company against people who might attack take a look at some of the people who followed Tesla and equity research ads you can't call them Equity they're cheerleaders I once saw Tesla sells at equity research analysts get into an argument with Elon Musk and tell him he was underestimating the expected potential of Tesla I won't name the name this guy's actually a very high profile equity research analyst that's the minute I said I will never ever read one of his reports because hey you might as well have Kathy Wood as a co-author and you can collectively say the stock is worth 15 trillion dollars the fourth is a lot of fact to Folia remember I said valuation stories and numbers you didn't say that I could research you see a lot of stories you see a lot of numbers but no connection between the two it's amazing in fact you'll have 50 pages and there'll be lots of tables lots of stories stories that have not connected numbers can become a fairy tales you're not Charles Dickens or Stephen King you can't create universes of your own you're not a novelist and finally there is this Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde component to Sunside equity research and here's why especially in the U.S or pretty much everywhere around the world you think of cell you're part of an investment Bank in the Europe you're part of a Commercial Bank and your investment and remember in much of the world's outside equity research is not at Revenue business you give it away for free why because you hope your clients will use your investment bank or your Commercial Bank as a conduit but not just trading but if you're a company that you they use the Investment Bank to go public and to do that's a Dr Jekyll hi because when you as a sales had a good research analyst have two masters to serve you're not sure who you're serving at any point in time so I think there's a lot of work to be done in Southside equity research because it's lost all credibility it's just as laugh value now if you don't believe me watch by recommendations you know what they'll pop up after the stock is in 1.2 trillion you know it's a recommendation after it's gone down to 150 bill it's almost become a negative indicator where will the stock go because they're chasing the price up and down they're not valuing the company so here are three propositions about about analysts first is there's far less public information in analyst forecast than you think it's not like they're bringing in some private information you don't have this this is the biggest private information to an analyst is the company itself you think so what the company knows more than the rest of us do about the future but it's also biased it's like a journalist whose biggest source is the politician he or she she is supposed to cover you're going to get spin you're going to get leaks and you're going to transmit the leaks but you're not going to get the truth because the company has an agenda so my advice to you and that's the third proposition is look up the growth rate in earnings and I have as a projective Fair company but don't be swayed by it so if your growth rate is five percent analysts are projecting 25 don't assume you're wrong and the analysts are right dig a Little Deeper maybe there is something you're missing that you need to bring in or maybe there isn't and the analysis is just projecting numbers that have really no basin I'm gonna no the last couple of minutes let me be set up the last way of thinking about growth I'm going to set it up as a picture let's say of a company that is a billion dollars investing existing projects on which it's making twelve percent as a return 12 of a billion so it's current earnings are 120 million just as a very simplistic example let's assume this company goes out and invests a hundred million in new projects on which it continues to make 12 percent next year when I look at its net income it's going to make 120 million plus an extra 12 million or 132 million the change in earnings and this is pure math is 12 million where is it coming from the addition I made to the investment base the 100 million and the return I'm making on that investment in other words I can't grow if I'm not adding to my investment base and earning a return on that interest that is the basis for sustainable growth in fact if I took this and stated it as as ratios I invested 100 million out of the 120 minutes so think of that as what I'm reinvesting 83.33 of my income went dead my return on investment was 12 83.33 times 12 gives me a growth rate of 10 which is exactly what I got as a growth right 12 million on a 120 million dollar net income my growth rate is equal to the return that I make on my new Investments times the reinvestment that's a lot of work right to grow then you got to reinvest you got to reinvest well is there a shortcut to growth yes but there's a carrier you know the shortcut to growth is remember the 12 percent you're making on your existing Investments if you can raise that to 13 percent are you going to grow next year absolutely it's called efficiency growth so when you think about growth there are two ways to grow one is efficiency growth one is growth bad and pure investment base and you're saying I'll take the efficiency growth you can but here's the camera if you tell me you're going to grow in the long term by reinvesting in new projects and earning a return it's believable right because you can keep adding to your base if you tell me you're going to grow in the long term it's all going to come from efficiency growth you see The Logical problem there you can make yourself more efficient next year next year it's going to get emotive but you keep it there's going to be a point where you hit the ceiling you can become only so efficient so if you tell me you're going to grow through becoming more efficient over the next three years I'll be okay with it but not for the next 10 years the next 30 Years or forever so through when we start up on Monday we're going to talk about sustainable growth and bringing inefficiency growth but keep those two growth rates open and think about your company and where it might be able to grow at least for the near future I will see you on Monday but watch for the email on your quizzes and when it's ready up in the ninth floor and I think yeah 
questions foreign foreign okay folks quick reminder next week is spring break that's a good news the bad news is if it's spring break we're getting closer to the halfway point of this class than we are to the start of the class which means a whole host of tap is going to come at you right after spring break remember if you want to get feedback on your DCF I think you need to get your valuation done by March the end of March so that like it's not it's optional you don't have to do it but I would strongly recommend that you get intrinsic valuation done because things are only going to get more compressed as you get towards the end of the semester so get the entrance evaluation out of the way I would send you a more detailed email and kind of a to-do list so you have a sequence of the other things I need to do um your quizzes are graded and ready to be picked up so they're in alphabetical order still kind of people have moved a few alphabets around so you can't find it let's just keep looking um it's upstairs and at the end on Wednesday I will take it back into my office because if I leave it out for spring break where it is it'll probably get recycled and you'll never find it again so if you want to pick it up pick it up before Wednesday So today we're going to complete our discussion of growth and kind of talk about a generic way of thinking about growth if you remember last session we're talking about analyst estimates of growth and how a lot of people in the value of companies use analyst estimates because the assumption is they must know more about the company than I do so I want to start with that question do they actually know more and if so can you use their growth rates in valuation so let's take analyst estimates and I'm going to talk about using them in valuation I'm going to tell you you know I'm going to make a few statements and you tell me whether these statements are true about analyst estimates so these are problems in using analysis it's telling me they're real problems the growth that you usually see on Zach's or in Yahoo finance as a growth rate for a company it's usually a growth rate of earnings per share of the company right as opposed to what what you're trying to forecast at growth in revenues of growth and operating income so clearly a problem the growth rate is generally highly correlated with historical growth in other words I understand to estimate buy growth for companies that have grown High you know you're saying what's wrong with that we talked about the limitations of historical growth so in a sense that's why Iris estimates do so much don't do very much historical problem yes the growth rate is not a good estimate of future growth this is the most damning indictment right even if it's a growth rate non-exposite it doesn't do a very good job once you get past one quarter ahead of two quarters there also a problem and finally if you use an analysis estimate of growth as your growth rate for your company my question is what sense is this your valuation of the company yeah think about what you're doing right if you put a growth rate in you're essentially automating the process nothing wrong with that but I could basically set up my computer to read the anus growth rate plug it into earnings project out the numbers do it you're not needed I'm not saying that in an insulting way I'm just saying if all you're doing is plugging and chugging it's really not your valuation so all of those are problems which is essentially an argument for a mini value company don't tell me use 12 because that's what analysts are projecting this growth if that's what you end up with it's got to have more than that behind today we're going to talk about where growth actually comes from growth doesn't come from you and I endowing companies that grow it doesn't come from analysts it doesn't come from management it comes from choices you make as a college and not giving away the storm here's what drives you growth as a company how much you reinvest how well you reinvest so let's take a very simplistic example let's assume a company that's reporting 75 million in after tax operating income on invested capital of a billion so right now it's earning is seven and a half percent return on Capital and let's assume that it plans to invest nothing more and its return in capital is going to stay what it is today so it's not going to reinvest from this day on it's going to basically maintain its capital and keep its return cap awareness without even knowing any fighting just in terms of math what growth rate can this company have well you're going on seven and a half percent next year 75 million 75 million and in other words your growth rate is going to be zero let's say simplistic what are the two ways this company can grow what is it can add to the invested Capital by taking new Investments raise the investment capital and try to keep the seven and a half percent going what's the other seven and a half to nine percent let's call it the first growth reinvestment growth the second growth efficiency growth they both look the same in hindsight but here's the difference if I just look at that growth here I'd rather have efficiency growth and reinvestment growth because it doesn't require additional Capital being investing so you think this is good I'd go for efficiency growth but there's a catch if you have efficiency growth next year I'm going to say okay that makes sense any efficiency growth the year after I'm going to push back and say you're getting really efficient at some point in time you're going to hit a ceiling right efficiency growth comes with an ending in time you can't keep so you can't tell me your company will keep growing Forever by becoming more efficient over time that doesn't make any sense eventually to keep growth going you need to read best that's kind of a summary of what we're going to talk about first so if I could raise my return on Capital seven and a half to ten percent you can already see what next in fact somebody tell me mathematically what the growth rate is going to be next year if you reinvest nothing but all you do is raise your return on Capital from seven and a half to ten percent right now you make 75 million right next year how much are you going to make 100 million you're gonna have a 33.33 growth rate next year because you're able to improve your return on account so this is in rocket science when you look at a company you project Rock you've got to tell me where the growth is coming from and how much of reinvest generate them growth so let's turn back to where we were in the slides I think we were in slide 177 where I'd set up the reinvestment policy but I'm going to kind of nail down this issue of reinvestment and so how much are you reinvesting and how well you reinvest and everybody is a framework we've already talked about before when you sit down to value a company you have to make a choice are you adding equity rebelling the entire firm and within Equity you can say am I going to take the lazy way out of looking at earnings per share and dividends or I'm going to look at free cash flow equity the way you think about how much you reinvest and how well you reinvest is going to be determined by the choice you make let me be specific if you're looking at earnings per share and you're projecting out a dividend discount model I'm going to estimate how much your reinvestment is by looking at the percentage of your net income that you put back into the business you guys have heard of payoff ratios right what is the payout ratio measure the percentage of your net income that you pay out as dividends so if I say the payout ratio is 40 I'm saying your retention ratio is 60 so think of the retention ratios the percentage of your earnings that you put back in the business that's how I measure reinvestment if you ask me how well am I reinvesting because I'm Equity focused I'm going to give you a return and end net income divided by Book value of equity keyword is Book value this is the only place in finance we go to csu's book bags everywhere else when we talk about debt and Equity it's always Market values when you compute accounting returns who has book values I'm going to come back and ask why is that why the focus on bookmark so with earnings per share retention ratio becomes what you reinvest return in equity becomes how well you reinvest let's move to pre-cash based Equity with free cash flows Equity you're not assuming that everything you don't pay out as dividends gets reinvested you see why that's a dangerous assumption if I don't pay out something that is dividends I might be just holding it in cash in the first approach I'm trading it is really investment so when you talk about free cash flow Equity I'm going to be much more specific I said tell me what you actually reinvest and I can measure that right it's going to be capex minus depreciation net capex change in working capital and here again think of everything we talked about with netcap exact positions already and then to the degree that some of that gets paid forward debt you're saying well I don't have to come up with it as an equity investor so reinvestment is now measured directly by looking at what you put back in the business and your Equity portion of that is whatever you have to come up with as an equity investor you divide that by net income you come up with what's called an equity reinvestment rate so pause and think about it retention ratio versus Equity reinvestment rate what the differences are retention ratio you're just taking dividends as what's paid out whatever's retained is reinvested with an equity reinvestment rate you're actually looking at what the company's putting back into the business there are two other dimensions on which retention ratios and Equity reinvestment rates can differ what's the highest number a retention ratio that's the highest percentage of earnings you can retain 100 what's the lowest retention ratio you can have as a company zero percent so retention ratios are constrained by zero and I say who cares let's go to Matt what's the highest number in equity reinvestment rate can can you reinvest more than 100 yes by raising fresh Capital so already you're relaxing that constraint you can say a company can reinvest more than its net income by raising fresh capital yes it would show up in the in the net capex and change in working capital being greater than the net income so you might 15 net income and reinvest 300 your Equity net Equity reinvestment rate is going to be sixty six hundred percent so you will grow earnings but you're growing it by raising fresh Capital you can't do that with a per share number because per share numbers you're constrained by how how you raise the cap so already I've relaxed can your Equity investment rate be less than zero percent so what has to be true your numerator here has to be a negative number right so the question I'm asking is can net capex be negative absolutely capex can be less than depreciation change in working capital can be negative you say this is not good I agree with you but you can end up with a negative equity reinvestability what does that mean if a company has a negative reinvestment rate in any one year it could be an oddity something happened that yeah but if you repeatedly have negative equity reinvestment rates what are you doing as a company your shrinking as a company we're opening the door that can be so already you can see with Equity reinvestment rates you get more flexible you can deal with really high growth companies or shrinking companies you can't do that with retention ratios and because you're focused on what you're investing back in your operating assets the way I'm going to measure return in equity is going to be slightly different traditional return Equity you take net income and divide by vocabulary right but net income for a company can come from two places it can come from your operating assets but it can also come from the cash you've accumulated in the company many are saying how much can I make on cash the last decade you didn't make much but right now if you have cash you're making about 4.8 that's a people rate anybody can do it I could do it I can go in the people auction if any of you have cash in your brokerage account for God's sakes don't leave it as cash we got sloppy over the last decade because in the last decade you made point one percent who cares 4.8 you should care so when you think about net income some of it comes from your cash and some of it comes from your operating assets and if you look at book equity some of that Equity is invested in operating assets and some of it is invested in cash so there's a version of return Equity where you take the cash out of the process what do you do you take the income from from cash out of United so your net income will be net of that amount and when you do your book Equity you net out cash from book equity basically saying I'm focused on just see why you want the the reason you want to know the answer for this is you're trying to get a sense of how good am I operating projects you don't want to get contaminated by the fact you have a lot of cash only four percent and draw the wrong conclusions so you're focusing on free cash flow Equity your measure of reinvestment becomes the equity reinvestment rate and you measure of how good projects are becomes this non-catcher retirement but you're still answering the same two questions how much are you reinvesting how well are you read let's turn to free cash flow to the firm when you use operating income here when I think about reinvestment I'm not focused on how much of your net income is going back into the business I'm looking at the percentage of your after tax operating income you're putting back into business and here I'm looking at the total reinvestment not just the equity portion change in working capital and my denominator becomes the after tax office I'm staying internally consistent in my focus on free cash flow firm I want to look at the percentage of my after tax operating income that goes back into business Equity reinvestment rates and reinvestment rates share some common routes you have no no ceiling no floor but reinvestment rates measure the percentage of your dope after tax operating income that goes back into the business and if I'm looking at the entire business I no longer care about returning Equity right I've got to look at the return i o not just in My Equity but also on the debt invested in the company the way I measure how well you're reinvesting is by taking the after tax operating income the income to all claim holders and dividing by Book value of equity plus book value of debt minus cash it's still Book value but I'm looking that's called invested capital you can already see that people are sloppy I see people multiplying retention ratios by return invested capital reinvestment rates by return Equity you can't do that consistency demands that you make your choice upfront and Define how much you reinvest and how well you reinvest based on those choices so I know it sounds incredibly abstract so let me take you through a few examples see this is called a sustainable growth rate because essentially you think how much you reinvest and how when you reinvest and the product of those two numbers gives you the truth I'm going to add a very important qualifiers when you can do this but let's go through some very simplistic applications first one I'm going to use the earnings per share approach and I was valued Wells Fargo in in 2008 throughout the crisis so I'll give you a pre-crisis valuation of post crisis valuation so you can see how these numbers affect your valuation so when you're looking at earnings per share retention ratio becomes a measure how much you reinvest return in equity becomes your proxy for hourly rate in 2008 just before the crisis Wells Fargo was only going to return an activity of 17.56 and this was a true cross-backs leading to the crisis they were all reporting really high in terms of equity we didn't know fully at that time that they were pushing the limits on these numbers they were going to riskier business initiate and the regulatory authorities were not catching so let's end this moment of ignorance I take that that retention ratio of 45 and the return Equity of 17.36 percent said that's what they can keep doing in the future I mean a horrible mistake in hindsight but in June of 2008 I'd have said you know what if they can maintain those numbers my expected growth rate is going to be the product of those two numbers it's about eight percent surveilling Wells Fargo June of 2008 I'd have used eight percent as my growth rate in earnings per share per year and if you ask me why I'd upset because they could maintain this return in equity and this retention ratio so I'm going to ask you a question that's it September of 2008 the crisis hits and one of the things that regulatory authorities decided was they've been two lakhs that Banks needed more Capital to keep going so in October or November of 2008 the regulatory Capital requirements at Banks was raised about 30 percent let's say you're looking at the Wells Fargo numbers from 200 let's say none of those numbers have changed net income hasn't changed the return the dividends haven't changed but now the rules have changed right because your book Equity now has to increase by roughly 30 percent reflector so what's a simplistic correction I can make even if I don't want to change the basis what's going to happen my numerator would stay the same but my denominator I'll have a book Equity that's 30 higher my third Equity is going to go from 17.56 percent to about 14 percent even if I change nothing else my expected growth in earnings per share is going to drop from eight to six percent now do you see when you value back so it's last basket for the dividend discount model why you care so much about what the regulatory Capital authorities are thinking because if they make those requirements more restrictive it's going to have an impact on your return in equity by having an impact on your return Equity it is going to have an impact on your expect control so this is the most simplistic sustainable growth model it's been used for 50 or 60 years people using all kinds of bad places but implicitly when you use this approach you're assuming the existing return in equity is essentially going to be a return Equity forever and if you're willing to make that assumption this equation will work let's move first let's take a closer look at that return algorithm so what pushes up your growth rate is having a high return Equity right so let's say you're a CEO of a company and you say you know what I want a hire sustainable growth I'm going to try to increase my integrity if you break down return equity it comes from two choices you make in some cases you can have a high return on Equity as a company because you take really good projects apple has a 35 return angry because whatever invest makes a huge return so the first way to high return Equity is to take great products that's so much work and it's so difficult to do so what's the second way you can pump up your return by putting every real estate developer knows how to do this what do you do you borrow money how does that push up your return Equity it reduces the equity invest and to the extent that what you make on projects exceeds your cost of borrowing after taxes that difference costs Equity investors so if you break down the return Equity you can actually break it down as return on Capital which is what you make on your base project plus this leverage effect and The Leverage effect is going to be the debt to equity ratio times the difference between what you make on your projects and your cost to debt so that's a minimal condition you need to be able to make more in your projects in your after tax cost of debt but that's not asking for very much right because the after tax costs are dead even with higher interest rates today it's like three to four percent it's almost every project will have a higher return in equity as you push up the debt range you think why should I Kim you see why you should care I'm going to take an example late 90s it's a Brazilian beverage company called Brahma since being renamed as above it's one of Latin America's biggest beverage got to put in snap and it's controlled by the 3G Captain this well-known you know private Equity Group so when I first looked at Brahma the first thing that John taught me they had a 31 returning that's impressive but I wanted to see whether that return in equity came from great projects or whether it came from lunch so I first computed the return on Capital return Capital remember is based on after tax operating income and Book value investment so what you bought has no effect on return Capital it's a function of the quality of your projects so if they took no debt on the return Equity would be 19.91 for every dollar of equity they borrowed 77 debt to equity ratio was 0.77 so they're heavy uses of that and on that debt they were paying an after-tax cost of 5.61 percent let's see what they're doing they're borrowing money at 5.61 investing in a project making 19.91 that difference of 14.3 percent goes to the equity Investments that's a great attraction of borrowing money so out of the 31 return Equity 19.9 comes from projects the remaining 11 comes from the user you said why raw distinction what do we when you use return Equity to get projected growth rates in earnings per share and dividends per share and cash what do we discount those Equity cash flows back at cost of equity right so the way you're pumping up your return on Equity is by using more debt there's another shoe waiting to drop which is my cost of equity for your project is going to be much harder so the distinction between an apple that earns a 31 return Equity is very little debt and a Brahma that owns a 31 return Equity is a lot more debt is even if they were in the same business and they're not I'd use a much higher cost of equity for Brahma because I'd use a level paid this is the reason that we never made it because it at least forces us to think about hey what will using more debt due to my cost of energy so sustainable growth with earnings per share retention ratio and returning but we talked about its limits right you're a company that's you know the most my growth rate can be with this approach is it cannot exceed my internet to their retention ratio is a hundred percent my grocery can't drop below zero percent and that doesn't make sense because we know companies grow their net income and much more then they return equity and often have negative growth rates so to deal with that I'm going to take the second approach where rather than focus on what the company is not paying up as my reinvestment I actually explicitly measure what they reinvest yes so how do you find the rent balance I try different numbers right in a sense you you're sitting there with a spreadsheet you can say what if I so both numbers are being driven by it it's not you know you can see what will happen if I have zero so remember last session we talked about free cash flow equity and cost of equity and how that balance plays out this is another way to find your optimal debtoration but here's what you cannot do you can't focus on maximizing return in equity and say that increases my value of equity because maximizing your return Equity might come at a debt ratio that's so stratospheric that your cost of equity is also really so if nothing else you can take the difference between Roe and cost of equity and look at how the difference changes your deterioration changes and look at what you're tipping for it is it's not focus on net capital exchange the big difference here is you're now focused on what the companies actually reinvesting rather than what it's not paying out is different so it's much more explicit and there's no excuse for not doing this right they're all there why trust the company but when they say well we've reinvested everything else so the equity reinvestment rate looks at the total amount that you put back in the business net of debt and your non-cash return Equity looks at what you will make on your projects if you focused on just the offering so it's a it's a different more focused version and because you're looking at reinvestment rates you're no longer constrained to be you know less you know to be between zero and 100 you can have more than 100 or less than zero percent so I'm going to try this again on a company and I'm going to go back in time right and this is without capitalizing brand name advertising so it might look different we in fact we can ask the question what will the numbers look like if you capitalize brand name advertisements so I looked at traditional reinvestment just to give you a sense of reinvestment in Coca-Cola you need some history you look at a beverage company your big capital investment if you're a beverage company is not in the syrup it's in the bottling plants and about 40 years ago Coca-Cola decided to spin off its bottling plant so that actually if you try to buy shares in Coca-Cola be careful that you're buying the right Coca-Cola you can buy Coca-Cola the beverage company or you can buy Coca-Cola bottle implants you know what this also means right they don't have traditional large amounts of net capex guess what when I look at their their numbers it reflects the non-cash net income was about 11.7 billion so what I'm doing is taking the net income subtracting out the income from the cash bank and we're starting 105 million the non-cash book Equity was about 18.3 billion it took the book Equity subtracted out the cash balance the non-cash return equity is 64 percent it's astounding right but remember I said I haven't capitalized brand name advertising so uh no I'm escalating the return Equity because I'm not bringing the biggest asset on the box when I look into the statement of cash flows it looked like that capex this is the accounting capex of 2.2 billion the depreciation was 1443 million so they basically reinvesting about 700 million at least according to the equipments and even we added the working capital change the total amount we invested is about 957 very saying why are you subtracting out the 150 million remember I'm looking at just the equity investors it's about 150 million of this is coming from debt the 957. so if I divide the 957 Million by the 11.7 billion the reinvestment rate is 8.18 okay so if I take those numbers as a given 8.18 times 64 gives me an expected growth which is not bad given the fact that they're reinvesting almost nothing of 5.22 percent now Ed help me out here if I capitalize brand name advertising Plus what's going to happen to my non-cash return entry so somebody want to help it so let's look at the effect of capitalizing let's say if I capitalize brand name advertising I do affect my net income right because I then add back the rmd at the advertising subtract out the amortization but there's an even bigger impact on my book Equity remember the unamortized portion of advertising especially if you're looking at a 25 or 50 year life is going to push up my book Equity much more than my net income my return Equity is going to go from 64 to maybe 25 still great but but much more believable I don't believe that Coca-Cola is making 64 so you return in equity is going to come down you think that's going to be terrible my growth rate is going to drop off not really right because what else is going to change my Equity reinvestment rate now has to include advertising as part of my capex I'm going to get a much higher Equity reinvestment rate you think will the product work out to 5.22 you wish because if it worked out to 5.22 we'd never capitalize r d right or advertising it'll work out to a different number but a number that I think is more believable as a forecasting number and this is why we capitalize r d and advertising because if you remember the free cash flow to the firm is unaffected by those numbers the free cash flow equities are affected you're saying why did we waste our time it's to get a better sense of what's a true return on capital or return equity in this company what's a true Equity reinvestment rate so any questions on how so basically we're trying to do the same thing we're just measuring it differently because we're focusing on free cash flow equity and non-cash effects which brings us to the third approach to sustainable growth here's the most generic right you're trying to Value The Firm now you estimate reinvestment is a percentage or after tax operating income that goes back into the business no longer net out the debt and you return an invest in capital now I I want to say something I use the word return on Capital return investment Capital return on Capital employed interchangeably there are people who splice these difference I've never understood it so whatever you want to use I'm okay with it as long as you stay consistent use the same thing this is return invested Capital as far as I'm concerned it's after tax operating can do a book value debt plus book value but Equity minus cash and this is probably a good time to stop and ask a question why have we given up this fixational market value when we get to a continent I said this is the only place in finance we use book values why do we use book values rather than Market values when we compute return in returns as you can anybody yes because that's the actual Capital being used so why don't we do that with caustic happening because that because on cost of capitals or an investor you are being almost return the investor gets here you're going down a dangerous road right remember what we said about every DCF what's every DCF it's an acquisition exercise and acquisition evaluation a cost to Capital use market value weights because if you try to try to go by Tesla today you can play book Equity so the reason we use Market values in the cost of capital is it's an acquisition cost the reason we use book values is because we want to get a sense of what you're actually made on your products in fact let me cut to the chase if I did Market values right and I truly restated your your your Capital to market value you know your return what's the definition of market value you're earning your cost to Capital the return Capital every company should end up close or equal to its cost this is why I don't like fair value accounting they're taking away ammunition I need to decide whether a company's taking good products every project good and bad will have a return Capital equal to the cost of capital how is that useful I'd rather that you told me what was actually invested I might have still have to do inflation adjustments on it and what you're making because it gives me a better measure of what this company's actually earned on its projects we'll come back and talk about the limitations of return investment Capital but that's why we use booklets we're trying to get a better sense of what did you actually invest what did you actually mean so when you look at return on Capital that's basically what you're focusing on and here's how having a higher return Capital will happen for a given reinvestment rate having a higher return on Capital give you a higher growth so you're two companies reinvesting the same amount the company with a higher return capital is going to have a higher conversely if you both grow at the same rate having a higher return Capital allow you to give back more cash flows because you need to reinvest it becomes the metric that's going to drive whether your growth is valuable zero value or negative that because that  cap is going to determine how much you're request so let's close this section by actually bringing these numbers together the late 90s what are the stars of the market was Cisco so let's go went from a market cap of 4 billion in 1990 to a market cap of 400 billion 10 years later 1999. and what made Cisco unique and if you remember is the Acquisitions they did along the way so we talked about how Acquisitions should be part of netcap X so when I include the acquisition that reinvestment rate was 107 if you go back in the slides you can see what my reinvestment r d and the acquisitions so that half the game is done right they're reinvesting a lot but what made Cisco so impressive as a company in 1999 was a return and investment Capital was 34. they were pulling off a trick that very few companies can pull up which is reinvest a lot and reinvest well at the same time now you can see why they were a star company you take the product of those two numbers the expected growth ready to get is 36 and here is a cautionary note in 2000 there was a star company that's what the numbers looked like they grew through acquisitions the next decade Cisco continued to have this High reinvestment rate they continue to do acquisitions I know what number changed there's 34 return on Capital dropped about eight to nine percent their growth rate went from you know being in double digits to single digit growth rate and people said what happened held up at a 400 million they were doing bigger Acquisitions their Acquisitions were not as good and this is I think one reason when you compute the return on Capital and reinvestment rate in the past you should stop and ask has the world changed for my company has the business changed because your job is to forecast the future not extrapolate the past and in this case the the parent with Cisco is things were starting to work against it was a much bigger company what does that mean instead of doing 10 Acquisitions you had to do 50 Acquisitions or do 10 bigger Acquisitions and already your game gets more difficult to win you're coming off a.com boost you now have an economy that's slowing down things both within the sector and outside the sector will change and if I'd use the 34 growth rate for Cisco I'd have found them to be fairly valued in 1993 years later I'd have looked back and said what did I get wrong and what I'd have got wrong is the assumption that the return on Capital can stay at historians so here's the bottom line in each of these approach and sustainable growth the key drivers that account you returned right Roe and the number terrifies that'd be quite a honest all of those accounting returns here's what terrifies me about it the numerators and accounting node right earnings net income operating income and the denominator is also an accounting number you think so what everything accountants do to I don't want to use the word screw up but to change those numbers will affect your return investment capital that's why we went back and capitalize r d and capitalized leases because we wanted to make them part of investment Capital because accountants are not doing it right if that were the only fixes life would be simple so much so if you if you could trust accountants to just be okay those are the two things that they were messing up fixing it wouldn't be a problem right but here are the things that can really make your accounting return on Capital go off go off the track let's say you have a company that's taken a bad investment you know what I mean by bad investment they invested now it's I'll give you an example I think it was uh conical at this 50 billion dollar investment they've made it the peak of oil prices in 2015. that five years later you could look back and say that was a terrible investment you're making only a three percent return everybody knew they had made a mistake and when everybody knows you made a mistake you know what accountants are allowed to do right you made a big mistake what did they do they take a restructuring charger right off then you can see I'm not picking on a card that you're doing it they're doing the right thing that let's say you write off 35 minutes you know how you write it up you write off enough so you're earning a decent Return of the project let's say it's two years later you're looking at Chronicles badge you're going to take the book Equity the book Debt the cash you're going to divide by the the operating by that number and you know what you're going to include this is a great company they're making a 12 return and what you'd be missing is the 35 billion that got taken off the denominator because of schools if you truly wanted to get a sense of what Conoco is earning on its project you know what you need to do you need to reverse the restructuring charge not just this yeah but going back in time now do you see why getting return and invest Capital can be a nightmare in a sense you're going back and reversing everything accountants do I wish there were a button you could hit the button everything gets reversed and capitalize you that's what you would need get a return investor capital rate I don't know how many of you have trouble sleeping but if you do I have a fix about 15 years ago I wrote a paper on measuring accounting returns an incredibly boring paper but if you it was all about so there's nothing technically Difficult about the paper it's about things like what do you do about restructuring charges what about Goodwin Goodwill is a nightmare in an accounting return capital and here's why but it's Goodwill it's actually what you pay over and above the book value to buy a growth company right so what because it's for growth assets accountants often take it out of invested Capital saying hey I can't count it because I'm not making money on it but good work can reflect future growth it can also reflect stupidity you overpay for a company where does it go it goes into Goodwill so a few years ago I proposed to accounting rule writers that Goodwill on a balance sheet would be broken down to strip it Goodwill and smart Goodwill they never took my advice but the stupid Goodwill I would leave as part of investing Capital because and in a sense in hindsight we get it right because when you get Goodwill impairment it's a conferencing that was stupid good one so a lot of these measurement issues and the reason I say that is return investment Capital has become This Magic Bullet at Consulting first what's your like you tell me what The Rock is I can tell you everything about your company and I'm you know I compute the retirement every publicly traded company I'm intimately aware of both its strengths which is you get this metric you can look across companies and it's weaknesses and I would strongly recommend that you look at the dark underbelly of return invested Capital because sometimes you can have a company with a return investment Capital 35 when once you start to dig deeper you really realize it's not a great company or a company with a return restaurant capital of five percent well you realize being unfair to the company because it's a young company an infrastructure company and not factoring in things that can happen in the future so I'm not saying don't compute it but I'm saying don't get dependent on it to read too much into it without looking at it because so that's sustainable growth sustainable growth as I said works if you assume that things are in steady state so if you think in terms of life cycle you know where sustainable growth will work for you inviting a company right mature companies that have had a steady state you know how many companies that are like that in the world today I don't think of too many businesses are getting Disturbed even kind of like Coca-Cola and craft times you know the under underlying economics are changing so you keep the sustainable growth equations in mind because they will come in useful when we get to steady state which in our DCF is going to be terminal value but we're projecting our growth for the next 10 years it's not a great indicator for future growth one reason of course is when you have this efficiency component it's going to allow you to grow faster because now you're improving the return on Capital by improving the return capital you're able to increase your growth so when you have a company with a low return on Capital it's improving its returns by cutting costs you can get free growth for a while as it and the worse your existing return on Capital the greater the potential for doing it right I mean if you have 30 return on Capital don't put efficiency growth they're already pretty efficient but if you have a three percent return on Capital you could potentially argue that this company should be able to improve its return capital and through that so I'm going to set up an example I'm going to show you five companies all of whom are the same road trip but I want to think like an investor slash appraisers that Titleist and rank these companies from best growth these companies all have 10 growth rates but the way they get there is different it's a function of how much they reinvest as well as how much in return investment capitals change so have a look at these fire companies and tell me which company is the company that has the worst growth worst growth in the sense of properties growing could actually be destroyed but the city bus company I heard somebody say five five five you get no long-term growth basically they're reinvesting nothing but they're getting efficiency good right you're getting one year of growth rate but that growth is still good growth is there a company where you can't even say any good things about the girlfriend what is it about three that should terrify you they're reinvesting a huge amount 200 they're earning a five percent return on Capital so they're going to keep growing at 10 no every year and every year they grow they're going to get less value you see why because that five percent that they're earning is less than that cost to Capital three is the worst company which one is the best It's Tricky which which one would you if you're a law let me separate we are a long-term investor which of these five companies you latch on to the reason I said long-term investors if you're a short-term investor the company that gives you growth with no effort at all is actually a company you're gonna get the 10 growth rate but then you're done all I'm saying is when you look at the growth of your company there you're going to see a company 15 growth break it down how much is coming from improving returns how much is coming from reinvestment because this is your starting point for assessing is this the kind of company where growth is going to add value session section by focusing in on the most generic way of thinking about crypto as I said very few companies have returned in capital that are sustainable reinvestment rates that are not going to change many of you are wearing money losing companies right none of the equations we talked about are going to work for you your accounting return is going to be negative your reinvestment rate is going to be negative so this is the most generic way of thinking about growth and it's built around three inputs that if you use my fcff simple against your spreadsheet become the three levels used to estimate cash flows and here's the three-step process you're looking at a company where margins have changed your margins are changing guess what you've got to climb the income statement to revenues and project revenues first so you start with Revenue to predict Revenue growth what's going to drive that growth rate you're going to look at the size of the market your market share what you think about your company it's comparative advantages we'll talk about the pieces that go to the password but the first piece of the puzzle is revenues and Revenue Second Step I'm going to show up and ask you what are your margins right now are crappy what will your target margins look like you're saying what's the target margin it's what you think your company will earn as a margin after it's gone through its growth space so you can't use any more excuses of you know it's infrastructure economies of scale you've run them all through for you and we talk about the economics that are determined and the reason I'm going to emphasize the economics is that I'm going to ask you a very simplistic question after I list all three on so you got growth Revenue growth you've got margins margin starts revenues give you operating income and then you need to subtract out reinvestment and now that your margins are changing your reinvestment cannot be connected to operating like it was in the sustainable growth it's got to be connected to revenues and the way I'm going to estimate is I'm going to figure out how much you need to reinvest given how much you want to grow your image so the sales to Capital ratio becomes a proxy for how efficiently you grow the more efficiently you're growing the higher that number is going to be the less efficiently you're growing the lower that number is going to be Revenue growth term I'm going to argue with those three inputs you can move the world you can give me any kind of company with those three inputs I should be able to divide into the company so with each input I'm going to let you pick whether you want to hire a low number for your company right so go along with the simplistic exercise if you have a company you want me to value and you want a high value for your company you're going to ask you what kind of Revenue growth that your company had will you give me a high number unconstrained by Common Sense I want an 80 growth rate okay next when I get to a Target margin and you want to increase your value you want a high Target margin or low Target like 60 margin 100 Revenue growth then when I asked you well with your Sales Decatur do you want to reinvest a lot or not reinvest very much I don't I want to get away with reinvesting nothing it sales to Capital ratio that's infinite so obviously what we can pick whatever number you want you can make any company worth any number you want you want to make Tesla for what what was kathywood's latest estimate for Tesla I think four thousand dollars per share four trillion dollars it's no problem just use a higher Revenue growth a higher margin and a higher in a high sales so I'm going to introduce some economics I wanted to think about and I hope you picked a company because as I go through these economics I want you to start thinking about what you'll be thinking about with your company and make research let's start with the revenue growth when you think about Revenue growth here company the first assessment you've got to make is how big is the market I'm going out and already you can see that if you produce a niche product or a product in a country that's a small Market no way of growing you're already constrained how much revenue growth you can have right so what's a total Mark in the language of Silicon Valley this has become what's called total addressable Market or ta apps I'm going to talk about how companies have gone crazy with that number but that basically if you're doing it right is an assessment of how big is the market I'm going now but your revenues is not the total market right it's your market share of that market and what's going to go into that assessment you're going to make a judgment of is my company so much better than the competition what are the barriers to entry what are the economics of the business is it a splinted business some businesses end up with 100 companies some end up dominating the three or four companies so it's going to market share I'm not saying it's easy but that's your starting point for growth rate so don't sit there with the girls I'm sure I use 35 or 40 it's kind of a meaningless number you want to start by looking at the search so I'm going to use an example to illustrate this process the example I'm going to use is the valuation I did for Airbnb and I picked Airbnb because you're all familiar with what the company does and this is the valuation I did at the time at their IP so the first question I had to ask was how big is the market for what Airbnb does you know the first reaction I get is nobody's ever done what Airbnb does but is that true did you travel before 2008 did you stay in places in cities you didn't know yeah right we call those places hotels and they've been around for as long as human beings have been in the face of the Earth so the place I started was with the hotel business the advantage of the hotel business is most big hotel companies are publicly traded you know why that's an advantage I could look at their revenues and I looked at the sum of the revenues across all hotels globally and in 2018 that number was about 660 billion dollars collectively hotels around the world collected about 660 billion dollars do you think that's the maximum Market size for everybody well if I'd been writing Airbnb in 2012 that would be a new market size but in 2013 I valued Uber and I did exactly what I did here and there I described my market as a car service business it's a much more difficult business to get the total numbers you know what who dominated that business before Uber came along and the taxi cab companies or so I had to actually go City by City adding up numbers from it was a nightmare you said why don't you look it up on Google nobody done it before and I came up with the number of 100 billion which I think was a pretty good estimate of the car service Market that I based my original Uber valuation on that 100 I'll come back and talk about the pushback I got in it but one of the people who pushed back was a guy called Bill Gurley you want to build partnered Benchmark Capital the BC Benchmark capital is one of the First Investors where he was in the board of directors of uber in 2013 he was rumored to be the person closest to Travis Latin who was the CEO over at that time so let me start with an easy question does Bulgari know more about Uber than I do of course and his pushback was you're missing the point that Uber is changing the car service business in what way that people were doing who would not have used a taxi cab but now using car service and he was absolutely right my youngest son for the long time I think he's still on my credit card when he uses over and there's some Saturday nights I looked down at my phone and I see seven Uber charges over the course of two hours now I think personally he's taking an Uber from the bedroom to the bathroom now take me to the um basically because it's become so easy right the carbon who throw two blocks not a big deal so there are people entering the castle and there are parts of the country San Francisco is the best example because ride sharing companies have been there the longest where people don't buy cars anymore why pay for a car and insurance when three red sharing companies right there they called them in there right there two minutes later I missed that in 2013. and I wrote it may accomplishing I should have seen that coming the only thing you can do is you can't go back and fix your 2013 valuation but the thing I learned from that is you could change the size of a business if you change I had to make a judgment and what that change will be and you know later when I do my Airbnb valuation you'll see now I actually projected that they'd be able to double the size of the market because people who might not have gone to a hotel are not much more likely to go stay in Airbnb because you think your family it's so expensive to get a hotel you know you might use an Airbnb instead so your total Market is going to be a starting point but what that market would look like might depend on what Behavior change is coming and if you look at the breakdown of the existing Market it's concentrate there's something about the hospitality business that drives to consolidation where was that player and I give a market share for Airbnb I would reflect the fact that you'll have a you know a few big players why because you already go stay at some no name Hotel because you have no idea what you will find there right you're part of a program at the hotel now I'm on the the Marriott so I tend to look for a Marriott first before I look for other hotels so I'm learning something about the business but then if you think about it Airbnb is in the hospitality business but it's not really like a hotel company right Hotel companies are constrained because they're physical infrastructure and Marriott is revenues it's the largest hotel Company by 25 billion dollars so I said look I'm going to look at somebody else who's playing in the Australian business who does something more similar to Airbnb which acts as an intermediate and the two companies are picked you probably heard of a lot one is Expedia that's been around a long time the others booking.com indicate with people said nobody's done what Airbnb has done hey booking.com and Expedia been doing it for longer they just connected you to hotels and it gives you a different perspective in the business in the year that I looked at at um at booking an Expedia booking had rev and gross bookings for about 200 billion dollars a lot of money that flows through that's a lot of money remember they don't get to keep the entire 200 they get a slice of that and that's the Airbnb business they'll have a big gross booking but their slice is going to be the 14 or whatever they keep um so that was my assessment of a totally addressable market now I told you Silicon Valley has learned to play this game so if you look at the prospectus for Airbnb they give their own assessments of what they call in the time they don't even expand it because it leaves it mysterious for you and their estimate for the total address of the market was about one point then a crazy sub acronyms serviceable addressment total addressable but basically I wasn't I was okay with their initial estimate 1.2 to 1.5 trillion but they said the other stuff we will do will increase the market to 3.4 trillion say what other stuff no one of the things that Airbnb promoted for a while is that hosts would offer you other services like what if you want to get a you know guided tour of the city for 150 I would never use a host of an Airbnb to be my travel guide because who knows what this guy's going to put me in and where he's going to take me or she's going to be but they you know but they said all this other stuff and they've left it kind of unspecified will take me from 1.5 trillion to 3.4 trillion that's a lot of money one no and this is part of the problem is when you make up totally addressable markets you can basically make up any number you want when we value Uber and talk about my total addressable Market which is too small but in there Uber IP the Uber IPO do you know what they estimated as their totally addressable Market 5.2 trillion dollars the entire automobile business is about a trillion and a half so how do they get to 5.2 trillion they added up everything everybody spent on cars maintaining car servicing cars they added mass transit and it's Transportation you know we'll call it a total addressable Market that actually makes no sense for a car service company to count at all but you know why companies like to give you trillions historical addressable amounts because as an investor what do you think this is why when people say well Tesla can have two trillion in gravity so what have you been drinking we can debate how successful Tesla will be but the largest automobile company is 300 billion you have 2 trillion there's something wrong with your storage AI will do it today the collective AI business is probably 100 billion robots will do it for you another 200 billion 100 market share both you still at 600 billion automated driving we have a problem here there's automated driving is your way of adding another 100 million revenues we need fewer cars in the roads right because remember the cars that 80 of cars right now where are they they're in a parking lot park waiting for the owner to come back everybody used to automate a drug need half as many cars automated driving will actually reduce your total revenue on it so when you think about totally addressable marketing you're going to make some judgment calls and one of the things you got to watch out for in Silicon Valley prospectus is they now have this Loop where essentially they argue that this they call this the networking basically as companies get bigger they're going to get bigger basically that you know and the way to think about this is if you want to list your apartment on an intermediate research let's say there are five competitors Airbnb Airbnb is the biggest and you've got VRBO and you've got three other no names guess which one you're going to go listed on people who are listed on the biggest one because that's where so it's almost as you get bigger it creates this networking benefit where it gets easier for you to get bigger and the other services disappear it's already happened with intermediaries it's basically Airbnb or VRBO because every smaller players disappeared because you're not going to list that nobody's going to find you but somebody had a question yeah good yeah also like uh assuming Uber's trillion dollar market is realized although that that could be the gross building so remember you get to keep 20 and we're assuming the 20 stays the same so to make the billion trillion so you can't mistake gross bookings for Revenue if your revenues would be 20 of that and then from that 200 billion then you got to subtract out expenses well not necessarily right the Tesla Advocates would say our automated driving is what's going to do so we're going to provide the cars that you can use for automated driving so if Uber wants to compete in this car and in this game and use automated driving cars they have to buy Teslas but you're right you're raising an interesting question of what exactly is Tesla's game and automated Drive I don't think they want to be an Uber very Capital intensive very logistic driven business not capitalism very Logistics but it'll be Capital intensive if they do it because they now have to make the cars and use them as their I don't think Tesla has the stomach for it so they're going to be doing something in the automated driving space even if you accept the premise that they're the best cars in terms of automated driving you have to then ask you know will they be selling the cars to Ubers in the lives of the world that's very similar to the business with the old car rental companies like hearts and neighbors the way you do it is you have to offer a discount you got to get them to buy thousands of cars it's not easy and essentially I'm willing to listen but these people keep adding a trillion dollars to revenue saying it's automated dropping I don't quite quite get how you get there right there is no business out there with that much stretch so that's the first stop right so stop take a look at margin so I said left to yourself you want to use 60 margins right but the problem is you pick a business your margins are determined by the economics you know what unit economics it's just a fancy website that extra unit that you sell how much of the revenues from that unit become profits so it's going to be a functional what does it cost you to make that extra unit the lesser the cost the better the unity economics software companies have great unit economics why the extra unit of software that Microsoft sells cost them absolutely nothing to me so when you look at the operating margins of software companies you're going to see 35 40 45 even badly red software companies can have 30 percent margins a Manufacturing Company can almost never have 30 operating margins why because you got to make a card to sell it how efficient you are in fact in 2021 which is a kind of peak year for Tesla they had they had gross margins of about 26 percent and people said hey there's my operating module 26 that's your gross margin there's many a slippery in the gross and the operating margin right you've got other operating expenses so if your gross margins at 26 your operating margins are going to be like 12 14 percent that's a Unity economics and already you can see when you get to this choice for your company your answer what is the unit economics what does my company do it'll also depend on how competitive this business is let's say it costs you almost nothing to make a product your first reaction is I'll have great margins but what if it costs almost nothing to make for everybody in your business you have 10 players in the business it's costing them almost nothing to make a semiconductor chip and you've seen that the cost drop if you have competition you know what's going to change right you're going to start knocking prices down so the second thing you're going to bring in is am I in a very competitive business because there even though the unit economics are great you might not get great margins and finally you have to think about what kind of business model is my company adopting sometimes you can do a trade-off where you go for higher margins and lower growth the niche business going after a discretionary product life is full of trade-offs and when you think about margins those trade-offs have to come into play so I've often heard people say you know if you have costs coming down margin should go up you know that's an incomplete story you now have to tell me why has costs are coming down people are not competing and pushing prices down because then you're going to have costs come down and margins stay low so with Airbnb I projected out of 156 billion in Gross bookings I thought I was being pretty upbeat the 156 billion would make them about 10 percent of the money spent in the hospitality business and remember the 155 abilities girls book their revenues are about 14 that comes from their business model so right now when you rent an Airbnb 14 of them or whatever you pay goes to Airbnb I make the assumption that 14 is going to stay intact and there again you might push back and say maybe if I have competition the 14 could become 12 this is where the networking benefits help you put you basically as you get larger you're going to have little or no competition you're going to end up converging on the 14. in terms of margins they start at minus 10 their money losing company but over time I'm assuming the margins will converge around 25 because as an intermediate in the unity Economics work in your favor and to get a sense of why whether I should use 25 or 35 or 45 or 50 I looked at booking.com which I think was the closest analog that I could think of from the 20th century in terms of what they did and their margins were actually 35.48 in 2009 Remember by the time I did this it was November of 2020 at the peak of covet the margin so I think the 25 margin you can push back to maybe it should be 30 but it's not going to be 60 months the clearly costs associated I think why are experience margins Road actually I was puzzled when I first saw it you know what expedia does that booking.com does not do that pushes the other margins they actually buy blocks of rooms from hotels and resell in other words they actually invest Capital it's a lower margin business it allows them to report higher revenues but that's what I mean by trade-offs if you want to go into that business I'm okay but then don't give me these 25 or 30 margins in their business which brings me to the sales to invested Capital here again left your own devices you're going to pick a really high number right pointing I get twenty dollars in revenue for every lot of capital but part of this is going to be determined by the business Europe if you're in a business that you need to build factories and plant and Equipment that's going to go in you'll have to consider whether as you get bigger that number is going to you're going to get more so depending on the business some businesses as you get bigger you're able to more efficiently deploy the additional Capital sales Capital ratio will rise in some businesses it might drop so you you can change the sales of capital ratio over there and my spreadsheet I allow you three shots what is what's it going to be next year near term what's it going to be between us two and five what's it going to be after year five allowing you three chances there my sales and collaboration could change but here's something you want to think about me think about sales account information if you have a manufacturing company that has excess capacity 50 excess capacity and you're giving them growth for the next five years you might be able to do it to almost no Capital investor right you're existing so if you look at my Tesla valuation and this might be a good time to go back and look at that week one valuation because at that time I said what did that sell to Capital ratio come from here's the story the Shanghai plant had just been completed when I did that valuation they were using about 10 percent of it and I said I'm giving them growth for the next five years but a big chunk of that growth come can come from all these plants that have come on to production just now so I gave them a high sales to Capital ratio not forever because clearly that capacity is not going to last forever and then as they that capacity gotten used up I shifted to a sales to Capital ratio for the industry so you're again you can look at what's typical for the industry and making sure so as you do this for your company factor that in so to complete my Airbnb story they have no access capacity right it's an intermediary business their existing sales and operations about 1.9 hebrarian dollar of capital they're generating 1.98 so I took their total revenues divided by total investment Capital same investment Capital that we use for roic so do all the things we did that capitalize r d capital is brand name advertising get a measure of sales investment capital they're already their economies of scale they're already there because Airbnb is already pretty big player in the intermediation business I am assuming that they've hit kind of a steady state now I could be wrong maybe they can get more efficient over time in terms of additional capital investment I don't think so but in that story you can raise the sales to Capital ratio over time saying they're going to see be able to get more efficient of capital development you cannot run away from the business you're in so if you have a business with the sales Capital ratio Institute and you give me a status of 10. I'm going to push back and say tell me what's different and maybe you have a really unique story for your company about how it's changing the business model but take a look at those industry averages because at least you get a sense of the reason sales and capital is so difficult to work with is if I asked you what a typical sales for Capital ratio for a company I have no idea returning Capital you have a chance at least 15 12 so that's part of the reason I want you to scan the data so when somebody makes up a sales to Capital ratio that you know is out of the norm you can push back and say that number looks off 0.25 well that number looks great but having that perspective is key making your Institution which brings me to the big number in every dcfm which the big enchilad in every DCF is the terminal map it's a number where the most mischief is create in valuation so I want to talk about why we need that number but the value of an acid is the present value it's expected cash flows over its lifetime which we have a five-year asset not a big tenure asset maybe but if you have a company that in theory could last forever you can't do that so what do you do you stop at a point in time and you estimate a terminal value so let's talk about that terminal value calculation because I'm going to give you three ways of getting the terminal value and one of them is a terrible way but 80 of DCFS use it especially back in DCF so now I want you to isolate that and talk about why first is you can do a liquidation valuation so you run your company for 10 years you liquidate the company you sell off this so think of it as an e basically you're selling everything on eBay at the end of your time so you liquidate Disney and you sell off the Peter Pan right in pieces I'm sure the collectors will collect liquidation to that perfectly okay right when is that appropriate when you have a declining or a dying business you can say you know what at the end of year 10 there's really going to be no demand for this business with publicly traded companies because it is a very negative perspective of the company the second is a going concern what does that mean you get to your 10. your company doesn't stop it keeps going but then you got to tell me what growth rate you will have in perpetuity or over the next 50 years and I computer president that's what you see in DCF at least in the most commonly replied version the BCF growth rate in perpetuity we'll come back and talk about what that growth rate is so going through sir that's it if you wanted to last forever is it okay if I get to your 10 and rather than assuming that things will last forever I assume only 50 years absolutely okay I don't see why people don't use it more 40 then you will have is a growing annuity for the next 15 years we know how to compute the present value of it the fact that people don't use it doesn't mean you cannot do it and then there's a Final Approach which is where 80 of banking 90 of banking dcs2 which is you get to your dad and here's what you do you take the ebitda on your 10 and you apply a multiple where do you get the multiple by looking at publicly traded companies in space say eight times a bit down and this is the one where you cannot do turn a value in a DCM you see what you made the biggest number in your intrinsic valuation into a pricing it's a forward pricing right let's face it everything else in your DCF is kind of secondary to eight times every time I use ten times seven dollars you know why Bankers like it right it's easy to adjust your terminal value by changing the 8 to 10 or 8 to 6 depending on what your biases are it's a terrible way to do it seeing why do people keep doing it because the Banker's job is a pricing job I don't even know why they wasted time on DCFS to be quite honest I'd be much better or I I think we'd all be better off a banker said we're going to stop doing DCF we're just going to do pricing we're not going to play this game projecting cash for the next year we'll use a forward pricing for this company the numbers are not settled in much more respect for banking pricing if that's what it was called but to take a DCF and make your biggest number into a pricing this is the point of intrinsic value it's all about cash flows growth and risk and pricing is nothing to do with any of those so with that lead in let's talk about this going concern assumption because liquidation valuation pretty pretty straightforward you go through the assets what will I get pricing you cannot use let's talk about the going good service take the Perpetual version because that's what we see most of them your cash flow one year after your last chance the mechanical detail to get a terminal value in your 10 I always need cash flows in your lab why because that's the way present value equations work you need the cash flow one euro divided by R minus G now you see why it's the most dangerous equation in finance let's say you're you're writing a company you come up with too low a number don't waste your time changing the growth rate in your one year or two here's what you need to do go to the terminal value hold all its constant and just change the G and move it towards the r right you know where you're going to go call these Buzz Lightyear valuations you've got to go to infinity and beyond you see but as G goes towards r your terminal value is going to go to infinity and then when G exceeds are you got Beyond I don't even know what that Beyond looks like but I don't want to be there with you so let's put some limits on this date first remember that this growth rate is a growth rate threat you can't let your company grow at a rate higher than the growth rate one of the most common pushbacks I got in the Tesla valuation was that I was assuming a growth trade in perpetuity of only four percent the Tesla is a special company I don't care how special you are there's a mathematical problem letting you grow more than four because you will become the economy then what interplanetary travel okay okay maybe they'll put the test lines on spacex's and send them off to Mars who would buy the cars on Mars I don't know but this is a mathematical constraint it's not a finance is sure you can't I'm not assuming it the math works against you the growth rate in perpetuity cannot exceed the growth rate of the economy keyword is cannot can it be low yeah in fact you could argue that mature companies should have a growth rate lower than the growth rate of the economy and here's why the economy is composed to both high growth firms and mature folks right if I let every mature firm go grow the growth rate of the economy then how the heck do I have excess growth for the high growth folks so the growth rate can be lower can it be zero absolutely you can have a growth company can it be negative how many times have you seen a DCF with negative growth in perpetuity I never know I don't understand this the reason I don't do some companies shrinkle you have a tobacco company what the heck are you doing putting in a three percent growth rate in perpetuity wouldn't it be more realistic to put a minus three percent growth rate what does that do your company will peak in your 10 and then a shrink over time gradually to become nothing fossil fuel companies declining or dying businesses and final point is consistency people often should I use a in fact I get this email at least once a day the people have done my valuation I'm using our two percent growth rate this is from somebody value an Iranian company and of course Iran getting cash flows you inflation is 20 he said I'm using a three percent growth rate your discount rate is 23 you put in a three percent growth rate you're putting in a real growth rate your value is going to implode if you're doing everything in nominal terms which I assume you are by the time you get to this point your growth rate should also be a nominal growth rate you're doing everything in rupiah your growth rate has to be in prepared a consistency issue comes in so I'm going to give you the proxy that I use for my pro trade thread and here's where I come up with the policy do you really want to be estimating the nominal growth rate in the global economy forever starting in year 2032. I don't even know I can't even estimate the nominal growth in the global economy next year what the heck am I doing projecting what the so I'm looking for a proxy and I you're saying why do you have macroeconomics what the heck do they know they tell you two years after recession there was a recession two years ago and said thank you for letting me know now that's how long it takes lbr to classify a recession so I'm going to use my risk-free rate as my brokerage forever and people said what's one car to do with the other what goes into a nominal Distributing what are the two components there's an expected inflation and an expected real interest rate right what goes into nominal growth rate in the economy expected inflation and an expected real growth I'm going to make a statement that I'll back it up their bricks that in the long term your expected real interest rate the expected real growth rate had to be close to each other it might not be exactly here's what if I promise an expected real interest rate of three percent and the economy is growing at only one percent I'm gonna have a problem because remember I have to deliver three percent more in goods and suddenly economy is not growing at that rate it is conceivable that your real growth can be higher than your real risk period but not forever something's got to be judged you think that's hypothetical or is that true so one thing I did was I actually went back over time and I got the 10-year bond at the start of each clearing inflation rate in the real GDP growth each grade we had the inflation rate to the real GDP growth I get the norm energy that people I will make this bet and you're willing to take it up I will wage at the 10-year t-bond rate has been a better predictor of U.S economic nominal growth over the following decade then any Economist or group of Economist prediction you have on the growth rate because over time you see that the t-bod rates are high normal growth is high because the same forces drug Rule and here's my other rationale even if you don't buy into anything I've said I think the risk free rate is too low which is what a lot of people said for the last decade you know what the best thing to do is keep your growth rate at that level because you're making the same mistake that in both your Lou rate and your denominator if you let the growth rate be the growth rate of the economy and let's say in 2019 you thought it was going to be four percent but you continue to use a one and a half percent keyboard you're being internally inconsistent so even if you believe nothing or what I've said there's an advantage to locking in your growth rate to your risk free rate because then if you screw up on one you're going to screw up on the other and then what is in the numerator the other is the denominator will cancel out many of the analysts have found company to be overvalued in the last decade here's what they were doing they were using normal growth rates of the U.S economy from history three four five percent they're using t-bond rates actually as they were one one and a half two percent and then they were throwing out their head saying what's going on why am I getting these high values because you're making assumptions about the economy they're actually different within your own equation your numerator is assuming one type of economy your denominator is not so you can either fix the risk-free rate by making it some kind of a normalized risky right or you can fix a growth rate by setting it equal to the risk reading but what you cannot do is have different assumptions driving so I will leave you with that thought and you get a chance to open up the fcff simple against suspension at least look at Revenue growth margins and reinvestment in sales of capital and start thinking about your company you're in the beginning 
foreign thank you guys requests [Music] okay folks time to get started reminder again if you haven't picked up your quiz please do so right after class today at five o'clock today I'm going to take the quizzes and leave them in my office until the spring break is over because if I leave them out for 10 days God only knows what will happen to them in the 10 days so if you don't want your quiz I don't care right so it's up to you but I'm just saying if you want your quiz you want to check it I think it's a good idea to pick up your quiz even if you're in denial and just check to make sure I haven't screwed up on a grading issue right you will never know if you don't learn and let's face it just because you don't pick up the quiz doesn't mean it's not there this is some kind of an existential but it's schroding as cat kind of thing there's no schroding us quiz which is right it doesn't disappear just because you don't look at it so my advice is pick it up look at it throw it away if you want to it's your worst quiz goes away anyway this is your preview you stood up no at least it's done uh the second is um I know it's a spring break your big plans you probably are not going to study but when you come back as I said the crap is going to hit the fan so if you haven't picked a company please do if you pick the company and you haven't entered the name in the master list please do if you pick the company entered in the master list not started your valuation please do you started the valuation you kind of gave up on it like two weeks ago please pick it up again so all logical things to do but logic often goes to the back of your head when spring break approaches so now because I give you that one-time freebie deal whichever you know for feedback it's got to be by the end of March so try to get your first shot okay so today we're going to complete our discussion of terminal value okay and the first question I'm going to ask you is a question that I already answered last week but it's something that I want you to be prepared for because as I said a lot of the people who value companies and they're going to be your colleagues that you work with a year or two years from now now are going to still use this exit multiple strategy so I want you to give me the reasoning for why it's wrong to do an intrinsic valuation with an exit month just summarize back for me what we talked about let's say what's what's the reason why why should you not use an exit multiple to come up with the terminal value um multiple uh multiple part of the based on pricing and channel Randy we are seeing a bit of cash flows that are disadvantages philosophically it doesn't make sense right pricing is pricing intrinsic valuations intrinsic value should bring them together I'm not sure what you have so you can use liquidation value you can use a perpetuity you could use a annuity you can use all kinds of assumptions when you get to your five or ten but you cannot use amount of you want to use a multiple just do a pricing make it a forward price that's all it is and call it a price don't call it an entrance evaluation so yeah go ahead if we were to go to firms that that's their standard protocols all right the Kabuki dances you'll call it a DCR you would play the kabuki dance with your colleagues with your clients the reality is in your heart you know you've done an intrinsic valuation so in a moment of honesty or when you're drunk or a child but the two might coincide call it what it is it's a forward pricing which is what all banking DCFS are they're forward pricing I call them DCFS in Drag right basically you you just you distracted me with the cash flows and you're one and two and while I'm distracted you slip eight times every time to the terminal number so don't look at that number the reality is ninety percent of your value comes from that pricing so there's nothing wrong with pricing let's stop being dishonest and labeling pricing as DCR you know how much time and stress this would remove from Bankers that they admitted to the fact that they're doing pricing because it'll take all the Kabuki dances you do of we have to stay busy we have to project cash flows and my question is why are you wasting your time it's a forward pricing just call it a forward pricing and do it better in fact later in this class we're going to talk about how to do pricing better in my view the problem with pricing is because you don't label it as pricing you're not doing the things that make pricing better so let's move on to this issue of perpetuity let's assume of a company with a hundred million dollars in after tax operating income which is expected of zero growth in perpetuity remember said we can have zero growth rate until maturity and it has a cost to Capital of ten percent what's the terminal value of this company what does it look like I haven't given you I've given you earnings right they've given you no capex no depreciation no working capital what is it about the way I've described the company that makes those numbers unnecessary what's the clue here because usually you need cash flows right you need to subtract out net capex and change in working capital right it is no growth because it has no growth it has no reinvestment if it has no reinvestment after tax operating becomes free cash flow of the firm you divided by 10 your value is a billion dollars right so let's hear that unless you come up with a billion your managing director says that number looks too low can you make it higher well what if I raise the growth rate to two percent so I have a generic questions don't sound like an oddball question because the answer seems obvious if I take the example that I just gave you and increase the growth rate to two percent what will happen to your value I'll give you the choice go up go down nothing will happen or it depends in which case you have to tell me what it depends on at First Sight what does it look like it'll happen the go up right in fact the math is in fact if I ask you what the value would be you take the 100 divided by 0.10 minus 0.202 this is magical you added 250 billion dollars in value 250 million what am I missing when I do that the cost of creating that growth in other words 100 million came from assuming that I didn't have to reinvest now you put in a growth rate so I need to give you the information to be able to estimate how much you need to reinvest which means a hundred million will get lower and how much lower it gets will determine whether this is going to add value So today we're going to focus on what I think is some the key assumption in terminal values it's not the growth rate it's what you're assuming about Returns on Capital in perpetuity that is going to determine whether growth increases value decreases value this is why when you get this angst about all the growth rate I'm moving it from two to three percent of my statement because my value is jumping all over your value is jumping all over because you're changing just the growth rate and leaving everything else unchanged of course your value is going to go up you created a Magic Fountain right in the front of your company and every time you want to increase the growth rate increase the growth rate and nothing else changes So today we're going to focus on those mechanics but I want to start with that question of growth rate in perpetuity because I kind of we did it towards the end and I wanted to make sure everybody is again comfortable with this push with the notion of your growth rate cannot exceed the growth rate of the economy forever the reason I bring that up is I got at least a dozen emails from the two classes put together on why somebody's running a company which is going to be the exception to the rule I'll give you a few examples of the kind of pushback I got you take a come like Apple how long has it been able to grow it above the growth rate of the economy 30 40 years Microsoft in fact if you ask you to name companies that have been able to grow for long periods there are companies that have grown for 30 40 years but 30 40 years is not forever so that's particularly there are some companies that grow for longer and the question that's implicit there is why can't I let my company have 40 Years of high growth before I put my company into stable you can right but the very fact that we can name these companies that have been able to grow at high rates for long periods tells you what that they're the exception not the rule if you value your company to be an exception right from the beginning where's the upside for you as an investor basically you're giving away the game at the start and your company is a great company not an exceptional company it's a negative surprise you need to keep something for yourself so even if your company is special there's nothing that prevents you from giving it 20 years of growth to 25 but the longest stretch growth out the more you're giving up upfront and the more you then are at the mercy of expectations changing in the company not delivery it's like signing a 21 year old to play centerfully because you have lots of potential he said he's going to be the next Mickey man Scott Boris convinces you to pay 500 million for the next 15 years on an expected basis you know I'm signing an exceptional player the only thing you can have is disappointment right when you've signed the player and said this player is going to be the greatest player of all time if he's only the fifth greatest player of all time you got lower the price you paid too much so there's nothing wrong with allowing for longer growth periods but that doesn't mean you can break this rule somebody else said ticket my in my undergraduate class said what if I let the growth rate be just a little bit higher than the growth rate of the economy and I said that's like being a little bit pregnant this is either zero one you're either pregnant or you're not you're not right you can't just this is one of those rules you can't break you can't just say what can I just nudge it up because that's a dangerous game you go 2.05 and you go 2.07 then 2.10 you're going to start playing with the growth rate till you get the number you want my advice is just leave it alone Capital the growth the growth here that was created and if you want to reward your company being a special company lengthen out the growth pair I'm not stopping you from using 20 years but don't mess with the growth rate in perpetuity using 10-year treasuries in a 10-year risky rate in our discount rate yeah can you can you change that rate when you get to your 11 absolutely in fact if you look at the FCF of Genesis spreadsheet one of the questions I ask you is do you want to change the risk-free rate after year I'll tell you why I put it in during the last decade what was the lament you had especially from older apps rates look too loud I said don't mess with the rate today it is what it is but if 10 years from now you tell me your rate the rate's going to go up to four percent you can raise it but when you raise the rate you're also going to raise your growth rate right and the net effect is surprisingly small because everything changes when you change that riskery so it's absolutely okay you can say you're 10. I'm going to assume that the risk-free rate is going to be lower or higher than it is today and then make sure your growth rated perpetuity is tied to that restricted consistency around exactly it's a consistency that's it you can get the risk-free rate and the growth rate wrong but if you're getting them wrong in the same way they have they basically can't it's the r minus G that denominate right both go up or both go down so which brings me to the question of negative recipients which is kind of a so if you remember the last decade there were currencies and you saw them in the chart where the risk free rate actually turned negative and when that happened people Frank up I remember I understand you can't do discounted cash flow valuation with negative risk read it my question was why not and you know how the reasoning went right if you have negative risk-free rates your cost to Capital is going to be really low so complete the stories why DCFS are not going to work if you lower the discount rate your value is going to go through the roof you're going to overvalue everything so in response to that critique I said okay I'm going to value a company in an economy with negative risk rate so this is the valuation of Heineken a day in September of 2019 to European audience that was very fixated or negative risk credits I start with with a negative risk period minus point five percent and not surprisingly I end up with a really low cost account so that's a good news but think of what a negative risk-free rate is signaling about the economy a negative is created it also goes with deflation or really low inflation so you're not going to be able to raise prices like you hope to and it also goes to the slowing economy I said those same forces have to play out in my cash flow so when I projected the growth rate and I projected the growth rate I gave them a three percent growth rate it's interesting because there were a few I think three people in the audience were actually from the Heineken Finance group and they got three percent you know that's a really low growth rate I let it go then I got to stable growth and I really shot them by giving the company a minus point five percent growth rate in puppetry they said that's not fair I said you weren't complaining when I used to minus point five percent risk free rate right what one hand gives you the other hand would take away when you're really low or negative it's pretty Rachel growth rates have to stay in sync and the value that I got was actually I think sixty percent the actual stock price I said look just because risk free rates a lot I'm not going to get a sky high value you know what give me a sky high value he said if I use a negative risk free rate to come up with my cost of capital but then when I get to the growth rate in perpetuity yeah I look at the Historical four-year nominal growth rate in the European economy and use a three percent growth rate forever the problem there is I'm assuming different economies in my numerator and that's causing my valuation to blow up in contrast to prevailing a company's Turkish layer the discount rate is going to be huge right it is pre-read it's 13 14 15 percent your growth rate can be really huge as well 10 13 14 15 and guess what evaluation is neither going to blow up nor implode because you tied the two together so that's the first stop when you think about growth trading perpetrator you don't think too long because let's face it none of us knows whether there would be a 2032 who knows climate change might kill us all by that depressing thought so we're making an assumption about things we don't know the only thing we can do is stay internally consent it really bothers you to use a negative risk credit do what I'd suggested change the risk-free rate after you attend make your growth rate three percent but then make sure your risk-free rate is also at least three percent then you're staying consistent evaluation will still work so let's talk about the second thing in terminal value and this is I think something I've already suggested when you sit down and look at a company so how long will high growth last in my company then later in this class I'm going to show you a graph which I think is one of the most depressing graphs to look at if you're a growth investor and that graph comes from a study that looks at how long growth lasts at IPOs because let's face it IPO has got the Pico growth the revenue growth is much higher than the sector and this study that did something very clever they took IPOs they looked at the revenue growth of these IPOs at the time they went public relative to the sector and then they track what that growth rate looked like one year later two years later three years later four years later and what they were trying to figure out is how quickly does growth convert to the center kind of a rough measure how long does growth last in your typical company you know what they found by the time you got to year four you could not tell the IPO company from the rest of the sector the growth at conversion percent for most companies growth Fades quickly because there are no barriers to competition coming in so when you look at your company say how long will growth last at my company rather than think of a number I wanted to think about the company's competitive advantages what are the barriers to entries and here's a clue if you cannot find one competitive Advantage this company has give it a very short growth period I remember value Groupon when it went public and at that time came in with this high growth trade Superstar status then I started what is special about Groupon the only thing I could think of is they got my email first that's all I could think of and I said well dozen other companies are going to come in with deals of the day and this was before the Amazon deal of the day et cetera I said I don't see a competitive Advantage here I'm not going to give them 10 years of growth I'm going to make the growth go in three years and I overestimated how long they could grow because this was a company with almost no competitive advantages foreign if you have strong competitive advantages that can be sustained two parts to it right you can have a strong competitive advantage that's going to slip away because it's technological or it's based on a person who can get hired away then I'm going to be a lot more cautious but if you have strong and sustainable competitive value something you know has a history of lasting then I'm going to build in a much longer growth period we had this brief discussion of brand name that would return to and one of the ways I characterize brand name is whatever the mystery it is that creates a brand name we know that historically it's one of those competitive advantages and seems to last a really long time doesn't mean you can't ruin a brand name I remember Quaker Oats essentially kind of pushing its brand name value to zero before rediscovering it so the stronger and most sustainable competitive advantages the longer you can have your company grow and above because remember it's not growth per se that creates value it's whether you have returns and exceed the cost of capital that's a competitive advantage so when you ask the question how long will Pro class keep that in mind because it's something to factor in third just because you're getting to determine well you don't forget all the things we talked about in the context of Europe we said to grow you have to reinvest and in terminal value this becomes critical you can be sloppy near one two three and talk about efficiency growth but now you're talking forever So when you say I want to grow I'm going to ask you how much will you need to invest when I describe the sustainable growth equations I said the word useful in most companies because returns are changing margins are changing but I'll tell you where they become really useful you get to the terminal value stage sustainable growth equations have to hold in other words your growth has to be tied to return on Capital and reinvestment rate because efficiency is now gone from the picture right you can't be improving returns in capital and perpetuity so to estimate my reinvestment rate in perpetuity all I need to do and I'm making it sound simpler than it is is estimate whether what kind of returns and capital your company can make for a part of you say but tough enough time figuring out what their return on Capital was last year you're asking me what will the return on Capital look like in 2032 I'll simplify the process if your company is in a competitive business like what automobiles apparel retail 80 of businesses in the world it's tough to earn more than your cost of capital you look at the sector in fact you could go to my website I tell you what percentage of companies need sector earn more than the cost of capital if you're in a business with difficult to earn more than your plastic Gap when you get to year 10 you know the safest assumption you should in makers assume the return Capital will be equal to the cost of capital in other words your value creation days are done you can keep growing but you're going to be earning your cost to Capital but about maybe 75 percent of the companies are valued that becomes that's the default built into your spreadsheet if you tell me nothing if you don't change the default I will make your return on Capital go to the cost of capital because for many companies that is the case and if you return on capital is equal to the cost of capital something magical happens take a look at this uh this table what I've done in this table is estimated what your terminal value will be as a function of the growth rate in perpetuity this is a variation on the example we did to start the class so I'm changing the growth rate from zero to three percent estimated we're not able to see the slides on Zoom well these things in the projecting the right size can you see it now yes thank you so if I change my growth rate I want to see what happens to the terminal back the caustic happened for this company is 10 if I set the return on Capital at 10 take a look at what happens to my terminal value as I change my growth rate nothing happens whatever I gain by using a higher growth rate I lose because I have to reinvestment this isn't rocket science if I earn my cost of capital in capital budgeting what kind of Net Present Value do I get on my projects per project that runs its cost of capital zero so how much value do I create by taking the projects here what if I take a hundred products hundred times zero zero nice thing about the zero times any numbers it's always zero so once you make that assumption the return on capital is equal to the cost of capital you don't even think about growth rate you might as well use a zero percent growth rate it's uh I wrote my first valuation book in the late 1980s John Wiley was the publisher and at the same time that my book came out John Wiley also published a book by McKinsey some of you might have seen the McKinsey evaluation book it's widely used out there so both the books are published by John and the original McKinsey edition of the book which for the first five or six years was written by you know Tom Copeland and um and a couple of other authors now it's written by a committee of McKinsey Consultants the original few editions I know the change here's how McKenzie did the terminal value section they had what they called No plot you're saying what's no flat it's Abbott times one minus t it's the after tax of the income divided by cost of cap there's no growth rate there and I get these emails that are not emails but snail mails from people saying I'm looking at the McKinsey book there's no growth rate in the terminal value equation can you tell me what which my response is why aren't you ready to Mackenzie are you ready but I guess they wrote to McKinsey didn't hear about it you know why McKinsey made that determined value because McKenzie also made an assumption that if you have a mature company it cannot earn more than its cost account the reasoning actually is impeccable no company has barriers that lasts forever so you're in perpetuity I'm going to assume return on capital is equal to cost you capital and if you make that assumption guess what it doesn't matter what growth rate you use might as well use the zero book but mckinsey's own research suggests that can be a dangerous assumption to generous is a publication from McKinsey called McKinsey portal if you go to the McKinsey website you sign up for it it's free you can actually get it it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a very good publication in terms of pragmatic research that we use in corporate finance and valuation and one of the papers they actually looked at companies and what happens to companies as they age and the results actually cut against what their their asking us to do I'll start with the news that's consistent with what we do as companies age when they look at the growth rate the growth rate starts to decrease approach towards a growth-related economy that's basically what we've said but they looked at the returns in capital they discovered that returns and capitalists thinking that you take a couple like Coca-Cola you track its Returns on Capital over time they stay high which means there are some companies at least where you can assume the return on capital is going to stay above the cost of capital why because of strong and sustainable competitive advantages if I'm adding a ramco and I'm putting in a terminal value at the end of your antenna bringing the return Capital cost of capital because the advantage they have is you stick your finger in the sand in Saudi Arabia oil comes up everybody in Canada you got to dig five thousand feet you gotta unfreeze the oil you got to bring it right you start off with an incredible competitive Advantage because it costs you three dollars a pair to get the oil out it costs everybody else fifteen dollars a pair that's not going to disappear after you attack so if you have something like that it is okay to leave the return capital above the cost of capital but do it only for companies where you think it is a reasonable assumption industry basis this sounds like each industry have a very specific and that's why I actually report return on Capital and costing Capital by industry so take a look at what those numbers look like for technology companies are routinely leave the return capital above the cost of capital yeah because it looks like even if you capitalize r d that technology companies have this excess return that's long term now sectors like automobiles the entire sector runs less than the cost of capital so do look at industry averages look at the return capital and costly Capital so when I ask you what will the return on Capital be Beyond year 10 that's what you should be thinking about what are my competitive advantages how long will they last now there are a lot of bad practices in valuation and once they get embedded they never leave no so one of the things you would run into is there are people who value companies where they get a stable growth will make the following combination of assumptions you tell me where in this combination I have a problem first they would say it's a mature company so I'm going to let capex offset depreciations I think hard coordinated to some valuation reports capex offsets depreciation in stable okay so what's your net capex going to be yeah affects officers representing that capex is zero there are no working capital requirements okay this is getting even better change in working capital is zero this is another advantage of zero numbers right zero plus zero is zero and zero divided by any number is zero so basically you end up with a reinvestment rate of zero what's wrong now comes my final assumption I assume that my company will grow two percent a year in production they're very selectively falling through so growth rate is below the growth rate of the economy but you see the problem right if you don't reinvest how the heck are you going to get the two percent growth so I'm going to hit you with the argument they will use my company is growing only at the inflation rate do you see where this is going right the inflation rate I don't need to build fresh capacity I don't need to build fresh factories I just have to sell the existing units so why can't I assume no reinvestment if I'm just growing at the inflation rate why can't I assume or investment it seems like a pretty reasonable argument right what is net what does net capex mean basically replacing existing machines with new machines existing equipment and new equipment right that's what so if I'm assuming a two percent inflation in my revenues and my earnings shouldn't that be assuming that that equipment is going to cost me more in other words I can't selectively look at inflation when I do my revenues and forget about the fact that inflation is going to if that were not the case you know what should happen to the returns of capital of companies as they age they should go towards Infinity right and they don't put simply There Is No Escape Hatcher you put in a growth rate I'm going to ask you to reinvest whether it's inflation below inflation and the only question you're gonna ask is how efficiently can I deliver that growth and Maybe by Just replacing the existing group and you can get a 25 return on Capital rather than a 10 I'm okay with that but there is no way you can assume zero or a positive growth rate and a zero reinvestment rate and fun when you get to stable growth you're 10 you're 11 you're 15 you're 20. you're making a company a boring company right boring company rights revenues have grown it's March it's a nice nice positive numbers hey make it a boring company give it the benefits of being a boring company you think what are the benefits of being a boring company what's the biggest benefit of being a boring company risk should come down you should be able to borrow money boring companies have lower cost of capital one of the things I've never understood in DC evaluation is people who insist that you get a discount trade up front and then you can never change it young high growth money losing companies what's your cost of capital looking like right now yeah High number right you have no debt you're probably Equity is risky maybe a 15 costly Capital at the upper end of the spectrum the 80th percentile when you start tell me what you're doing to your company on your spreadsheet you're making a small revenues into big revenues you do it so effortlessly like put a 40 growth rate you're making your losses into profits as you make the target margin positive I'm okay with that but if your assumptions about revenue and margins come to fruition you know what should happen to your cost of capital it can't stay at 15 it should Converge on the caustic capital of a mature company here again I'll tell you what's built in as a default into the spreadsheet when you get a steady state I push your cost to Capital towards the average for the market not even the average for the sector because who knows what you're diversify and do you can override it but think about it you want to leave it at 15 we leave it at 15 I guarantee you no young Growth Company will ever make it through your threshold because here's what you're doing you're making a mature company and giving it the risk of a young growth it's internal consistency it's consistent to your own assumptions so when you make your company mature company give it a cost to Capital that resembles that of a mature company give it the reinvestment rate that reflects its lower growth rate the company has the same name a Tesla in year 11 has the same name as Tesla in year one but it's a very different company right it's a it's a company with 400 billion dollars in Revenue so they're 20 margin twenty percent of 400 billion is an 80 billion dollar operating profit company make it one of the most profitable companies in the face of the Earth to be very different than the company yes um when you say that you always needs to be reinvesting capital in the company is that basically no no did I say that I said if you want growth I said you need to reinvest it's a statement that's conditioned so you want to have no growth then I'm okay don't reinvest but if you want growth in perpetuity you've got to be adding to your Capital base right and then adding to the capital base might just come from replacing existing equipment but remember you're replacing at the higher cost and you bought it at 10 years ago so really the two statements to go together so you can get away without reinvesting you can get away with growth but you can't get away by assuming the two in the same company what if the company is like generating capital goes to that so like but that's what reinvestment rate is coming from it's not coming from outside it's actually coming from internal analytics I'm taking a portion of your earnings and putting it back right so it's always in fact in stable growth you shouldn't be going outside if you're going outside to raise Capital reinvestment stable growth there's something terribly wrong with your company because it needs to be self-sustained by that so last play pay thing I want to do an intrinsic valuation is bring all the pieces together so let's see the pieces we went through started with discount rates right spent a lot of time on that then we went to cash flows measuring free cash flow from free cash flow equity then we talked about growth rates and looking historical analyst estimate fundamentals and then we close the terminal value those pieces all go in so when you think about every discarded cash flow model you're going to see all four ingredients so I want to talk about how you decide which ingredients to pick in your valuation the First Choice you have to make is do I want to Value just the equity in my business of adding the entire business remember we talked about this at the start and at that time I said if you do it right you should get the same value of equity either way so the answer to which one should I do will depend on whatever is easiest whatever is more pragmatic whatever you can do easier pick that path and stay consistent with one except if you're valuing a bank you have only one choice you can value only the equity you can't value and the operating as to the bank there's no such thing so if you're not valuing a bank and you face this Choice it really becomes which is easier to do so let's Trace each one through to Value the equity in a company I need free cash flows Equity right which is post debt cash flows and India cost of equity that reflects the leverage in my company to Value The Firm I need free cash flow to the firm which is a free debt cash flow and a cost to Capital that reflects a mix of data and if your debt ratio is stable you know what both are equally easy to do I can do free cash to the firm but remember the free cash or Equity I gave you that shortcut to get to free cash flow Equity where if your debt ratio is always 25 you could just take 75 of your emails answer if you have a company with stable leverage that's never going to change pre-casted Equity valuations just as easy as precational Department it's more intuitive because when you buy stairs you actually get free cash today but in most firms you're going to feel either that there's a sense of direction the debt ratio is low it's going to go up as my company gets more mature or it's too high they have to bring it down to get to steady state or you just don't know you know it's changing but you don't know in which direction if that is the case it's easier to work with free cash flow the firm and value The Firm than to value out let's think about why if you have a company where the debt ratio is low it's going to increase over time to estimate free cash flow Equity I have to estimate debt repayments and debt issuances remember those two lines it's a pain in the neck because you're sitting there saying what will it be how much will the debt there's almost a circularity here because you decide how much debt you've got to raise you got to estimate the value estimating free cash credit Equity gets really messy when debt ratio is changing so debt ratio is changing let's go pre-cast the cost of capital is easy to adjust for debt ratios just change the mix of that Network so 90 of my valuations end up being firm valuations rather than equity valuations it's not because they're better but because I'm lazy I'm looking for the path of least resistance and to me this is the path of least resistance why ought to be estimating three line items which are wasting my time they really don't make that much of a difference in my borderline in terms of value now within the context of value inequity you have a choice of you know so you use accurate evaluation where leverage the stable firm valuation when it's unscripted the context of a discount dividends or I can discount free cash flow equity I'll make this really easy for you if you can estimate free cash flow Equity always use it why it is more comprehensive it's not constrained by what companies actually do you actually estimate what they get paid it's a potential if you cannot estimate free cash flow equity you have no choice it's discount debits this is how we end up with the dividend discount model to Value Banks it's not because the model magically works better it's because we've given up we've tried to estimate free cash flow equity for a bank and after a while we throw up around and say this is too messy I have no idea what the net capex and change in working capital is here so let's see at the each Fork at the road Equity valuation of firm valuation for most non-financial service companies firm valuation is going to dominate Equity valuation within Equity valuation dividends of free cash flow equity well if you cannot estimate free cash flow Equity it's really not even a choice you're going to go with dividends but if you can you're going to go with free cash flow and that's always terrified me about Banks we're stuck with these divots and we know that Banks don't always pay out what they can afford to endeavits so later in this class I'm going to revisit that question especially post 2008. and talk about can we estimate free cash flows to equity for a bank using something else because the traditional way of net capex and change in working capital is not good now what this contract should use you pick a cash flow the discount rate comes with it right it's like they're locked at the head you decide to Discount dividends of free cash or Equity you're going to have to use the cost of equity in one currency in whatever currency you estimated the cash flows in real or nominal depends on what they did so by the time you're done of estimating the cash flows the discount rates kind of pick themselves you're valuing free cash to the firm use the cost of capital so as you look at these choices step back and say Hey you know ultimately I want to value for the equity what's the most pragmatic way of getting it because it's not that one is right and the other is wrong it's a summer some of these approaches take more work especially when Leverage is searching so if you bring it all together and you think about this final steps you know what kind of growth can I expect from my company for some of your companies you might hit paid dirt at least in terms of work you have to do if you're buying a company that is already a mature company and we know what we're going to look for to see if companies mature right first you're going to check the growth rate is it growing at less than the risk free rate so we have a company so let's say it means several criteria it's growing at two percent a year on end good example of a company it's not going to grow 12 a year it's a mature company two percent but that's not all you're also going to check to see whether it's behaving like a mature company what does that mean it's not reinvesting huge amounts you're reinvesting huge amounts for better or worse you can't put it in as a mature company because it seems to believe that it can have growth no correctly or incorrect you're going to look at the reinvestment rate you're going to look at the growth rate you're going to look at the risk of the company everything has to convert so if you have a company with the cost of capital close to that of the market as a reinvestment rate which is low reflecting the growth rate and a growth rate less than the risk reading linearly three inputs to Value economy you don't need 10 years of forecast right you need expected cash flow next year which you might build off today's Cash Flow you need a discount rate and a growth rate your terminal value happens right now terminal value doesn't have to be in your tent if you're already a mature company you're going to be done in five minutes don't go looking for trouble if your company can be valued with three inputs why am I looking for 30 inputs let's move One Step Up the Ladder you're valuing a company like Coca-Cola you think there's only by straps it's already a mature company but it is some growth left because it's some part of the world or some product they've introduced that's going to give them above economy growth remember that's not a high threshold to beat right if you're going to get six percent you're not a mature company yet pretty pretty close to the growth rate of the economy so here you can use what I call two-stage models the two-stage models what you do is you assume a six percent growth for the next five years the end of year five you move it to four percent it's not much of a transition so you can make it in two stages but let's say you're valuing a couple like snowflake software company you think there's lots of potential fifty percent growth for the next five years you definitely can't use a two-stage model right because you go fifty percent and go to three percent now see what happened in year six you don't fall off Clips like that to a 50 growth for the next five years and you want to make your company a mature company you want to create some kind of a transition that's just a fancy word for you need to get from 50 to 3 over a period of time for the three-stage models my fcff ginzu if you have a mature company basically all you have to do is put the growth rate close the growth into the economy even though you have a 10-year forecast your value basically as a mature company so it's flexible enough you can make it two stage three stage whatever you want to do but essentially those are the parameters that drive what your ultimate discounted cash flow valuations yes why is 10 like The Benchmark for like choose anything to say right to pick a number I mean it's you can make eight percent nice it has to be close enough to the risk-free rate that a drop is not going to shock somebody right so you could say well no even at 10 is too high I'm going to go three years to four percent perfectly okay but I'm saying there's a threshold you have to decide where to draw I mean think of it in terms of shock value right if I show this growth rate to somebody in the business would they be shocked by the change in the year the answer is yes you probably don't want to build a new transition so ultimately every discounted cash flow model you see out there I think of it as like playing with Lego right you've got the cash flow Lego box you got the discount rate Lego boxes the growth pad and Lego box you're putting them together you got a DCF Mark so the Lego that you pick out at the cash flow box is a dividend Lego then the only Lego that will print from the discount rate but is the cost of equity level I don't think they make Legos like this and I might be violating some patent by using window in Lego but basically I'm saying when people claim they've invented a discounted cash flow model yes what do you invent here It's a combination of cash flows discount rates and growth patterns but people try I know sad Fred Bernstein which is well regarded research work patented a dividend discount they actually patented they went to the patent office what exactly did you did you invent the word dividends is the discount that I should be it's people patent all kinds of things there's nothing new about discarded Castro models there's different combinations you can give them a name and put your name on top they are the H mod life and I've seen discount cash flow models with people's names attached to them is it magical just a different pad there's really nothing here that you can think of as new energy it's just basic common sense and being consistent yes I've seen like models with like a fade rate that's what a transition period right there is right the fade rate is basically my return on capital is 25 I think it's going to go to 10 right I can't make it go from 25 to 10 in one step I'm gonna so fade rates are just a fancy word for you know and you know what the fade rate usually is right take linear increments every year so but they like to use the word fade because you get this idea of people getting together in a committee and they're saying what's the fame Factor going to be it's one of the most pointless exercises then because your starting number in the ending number you get somewhere I actually all my models I use linear steps because I've discovered that finessing it makes almost no effect on that but that's all a Fame factor is is a transition so now let's talk about what happens after you're done with your discounted cash flow evaluation so think about it right you spend all this time estimating cash flow that you came up with a discount rate and then you put in a growth period you come up with the present value the Hebrew science relief and say I'm done and that's when the real Mischief begins so what I'd like to talk about the next stretch is what people do after they tell you they're done that can create real damage in valuation so understand what the next part of the process is going to bring about you guys know how Academia works I'll tell you I have to work really hard four and a half hours a week for like 38 weeks per year and they give me only like 17 weeks off at 38 weeks would be 14. it's only 35 weeks let's face 15 week semesters really I worked for 30 weeks of the year four and a half hours away and every because I work so hard every seven period very biblical I get the entire year off with that it's quite a so bad I'm sure you're all heading into jobs which will give you something similar but that's what my job looks like so I've had a bunch of sabbaticals over my lifetime because I've been teaching long enough to have generated these bags so there's a sabbatical I think like 15 years ago sabbatical years coming up and most people have big plans for the sabbatical year they're going to write a paper write bunch of papers do research and I was approaching my sabbatical year it is singular objective I said I want to wake up at 365 days with nothing to do every day I'm gonna do nothing when I sit back and I admit I must I got a little ostentatious about this whole process the first day of my sabbatical I go to Staples and I buy one of these to-do list boards that you can get I must I stay at home obviously I have nothing to do might as well stay at home I put that right above my little corner of the house where I have my computer and my kids were all at home at that time going to school came down the stairs I pointed to my list and the kids have nothing to do today piss them off nowhere but then they went off to school and I made my fatal mistake my wife came down the stairs and I said nothing to do today but she said really why'd you take the dog for a walk so I take the dog for a walk I come back there's something on my to-do list pick up bok choy at the grocery store I'd be quite honest I had no idea what box I looked like I was too embarrassed to ask I walked around like an hour and a half before I find it's like ugly looking cabbage tasty but ugly looking couch I come back home there's another item on my to-do list pick up kids from school and after about the third or fourth item I said I've got to find things to do to keep my wife off my list but I'm really desperate Now give me something to do and coincidentally I get this email from the editor of a magazine called CFA magazine Maxine had never read didn't even know existed never heard of the editor he says could you write an article for CFM magazine my first reaction is nothing to do why would I do that but then I remembered I needed things to do I said okay so I put it put in big letters right article for CFA magazine cannot pick up bok choy kids etc etc and then I did write the article and it tells you only thing I've ever written in valuation that's got me hate now you know how difficult it is to get hate mail in valuation nobody's ever written this I hate you for using bottom updates they don't feel strongly enough to do it or implied Equity risk premium but this one got me hate mail for a couple reasons one was the title that stopped the garnishing and I was talking about the process of people adding premiums and discounts to a discounted cash flow control premium of 20 25 I said if you do this there's no point evaluation because you're going to back into whatever number you wanted by using I might have used the word arbitrary to describe the premiums and discounts it pissed a lot of people off I get this wave of hate math but one of the emails actually I think made a good point they said if you don't like the way we're dealing with control and in liquidity why do you come up with a better way of doing it you're right 11 months left in my sabbatical so every month I'm going to take a loose set something attach a premium or discount to I'm going to go to the heart of it say if I lived in a world where I had to Value controller and liquidity I would add it so there was my plan for doing nothing over the sabbatical but it's now one half of what I'm about the modern evaluation the second half of the book is the result of that sabbatical so I'm going to take you on a speedy journey through some of these Loose Ends I'm going to start with catch to be simple right I said don't mess with casual 100 in cash and ask you how much is it worth what's the answer 100 I'm gonna ask a question that I think is a pro awkward question you have a company with a hundred million in cash are they types of conditions where you might discount cash in the hands of a company and if so why are there times and conditions we might attach a premium to the cash and if so why which I call the black hole evaluation because this is where you know you basically give up companies with 20 30 40 Cross organs in a perfect world how do you Value Cross Holdings and the word we live in with the information we're giving how do we make our best shot I want to talk about uh subtracting our debt what's the debt that I should be netting up to get to the value of equity so I know the answer but what if your company's targeting a lawsuit should I bring that into my because remember this is your last chance to even all the things that worry we will talk about controlling liquidity in a different context I'm going to talk about control in the context of M A but essentially I'm going to take you through and one of the things I want to talk about is this sudden surge in stock based compensation I'm going to talk about what do you do when you have management options what do you have to do with your restricted stock because people just mangled the process with what they're doing right now so let's start with cash and I'm going to argue that the way we think about cash is framed by that very start of the class where I said don't mess with things that are simple to add so in a discounted cash flow evaluation if you do the free cash for the firm valuation what do we do we keep cash separate from the operating assets we look at cash flows from the operating assets we discount back at a cost to capital for the operating assets and after we're done we just add the cash balance so how big can that be with apple what did I just add to my DCF valuation 150 billion dollars right so this isn't just Penny change this is a lot of money but the rule is just add the cash balance on if you do a free cash load Equity or a dividend discount model valuation you deal with cash in very strange ways in a dividend discount model it doesn't even show up right it's there somewhere but you don't know where because some of your dividends come from the income from cash it's giving you more safety but the bottom line is we're we're either deal with cash very simply or we just let it slip into our valuations so I'm going to show you three companies and I'm going to ask you a question about these companies which I think is going to cut to the heart and when you might want to discount or add a premium detection so three companies are very creatively named company a company B and Company C all at the same Enterprise like you've discounted free cash with the firm at the Quality Capital you come up with a billion dollars they all have a hundred million dollars in cash but I'm going to add some additional information about the companies company a as a history some this is not future return all I can tell you is password as a history of taking projects that are done invest Capital by 10 it's costing capital is ten percent it is a developed Market company I put it in the US you're going to wonder why that matters in the end I'm going to argue it is going to make a difference second company has a history of taking projects that aren't a five percent return on Capital is cost of capital is 10. it's also U.S company company C is an Argentine company it's cost to Capital is higher but it's got really good return to death 22 . I'm going to argue that in one of these three companies cash is going to be a neutral asset you know what I mean by neutral assets what we do to all valuations 100 million cash is worth a hundred million in one of these three companies you probably should discard the cash and in one of these three companies you might attach a premium to the cash let's start with the easy one which of these three companies is Cash most likely to be a neutral asset right and what is it about a that makes nucleus it's what I call a Blog company right what do block companies do they don't help you they don't hurt you they run in place they run the cost of capital but before you complain about block companies think remember there are Fates far worse than investing in a blocker which of these three companies you're most likely to Discount the cash and why what is it about being that terrifies you have a history of stupidity you know what you're doing you're attaching a stupid thing it's not the cash that's going to hurt you it's what these guys can do with the cash and what have they shown the history of doing screwing it up big time so you preemptively say you guys will find a way to screw up the 100 million in cash so you know what I'll knock off 25 of the cash that's probably a sensible thing to do with these companies yes all right in fact if you assume that they keep earning a five percent return on Gap that 100 million in cash has to be valued in about 50 minutes because they're building it so they're valued if you value the cash at 30 million you're getting a bargain so again there is a way of quantifying the discount because but I'm going to give you an easier way to you know untrap that discount and I'll give you a clue call icat does it over and over again but company companies C you might attach a premium let's talk about why if you go back to traditional corporate finance no company ever needs a cash balance you know why because you're a great project what do I assume you can do utopian Corporate Finance you go out and raise capital what's the big deal just raise the capital now do you see why I put company C in Argentina five times in the last 20 years the Argentine Capital Market is completely Frozen up you can't raise Equity you can't borrow money it's an assumption of capital is always easy and accessible it's gone do you see the advantage of having a cash balance in a market like Argentina because it's not a question of if there's a crisis when there's a crisis you have cash to survive and it becomes a strategic weapon you can buy other companies assets at cents on the dollar only mistake I made in this example was making it an Argentine company I actually did this to a Brazilian audience about eight years ago so which company would you discount well person every person in the audience could company C and they said why you can't trust these argentines but it turned out that they lost a soccer game over the weekend or something there are other things boiling under the surface but the bottom line is in markets where and it's not just across markets right if I gave you a small company versus a large company or a private company versus a public company you can already see the implications small companies should build up more cash balances than larger companies with less access to Capital private companies need more liquidity than public companies because it's not like you can go on an issue 100 million shares now you're probably saying do markets actually discriminate across companies I'm going to show you argue that they do but let's be very clear the discount we're applying to Company B is not because it has cash because I have to say cash is a bad asset you know what the argument is Right cash loans only four percent right now that's pretty close to where to learn and I can make my cost to Capital is eight percent I've actually seen equity research and it's competitive return and cash to the cost of capital for a company and argued that cash is a value destroying ass what's what principle in corporate finance are they violating when they do that because that capital's cash is really value destroying right 150 billion dollars I guarantee you they're not earning anything close to the cost of capital right now they're earning probably 4.8 percent since the table rip that's a rule in capital budgeting when you look at the discount rate for an asset it should reflect the riskiness of that asset cash is a riskless liquid asset and guess what it should earn 4.8 it's I mean think about what you can earn if you bought a table today that's close to what you should expect cash to earn that's not the reason we're discounting cash in fact if these managers could guarantee me contractually that they will never touch the cash I would take the discount away so let's look at the actual evidence to see if markets are that discriminated this is actually one of the most creative papers I don't read much academic research because most of it I don't see the point of what question they're asking should care this paper actually looked at what a dollar in cash is valued in the hands of a company by the market and the way they did this was they took all publicly traded companies and they ran a very simple regression market value against the cash balance they looked at the coefficient of the cash balance so cash is valuable dollar you should get a coefficient of roughly one on the cashback I'll give you the good news across all publicly traded companies a dollar in cash is valued at roughly a dollar you know why this is good news because this is what we do in every evaluation but here's the bad news when they looked at a subset of mature companies that are negative Accessory Touch you know what that means right they're like Company B they're the history of earning less than the cost of capital a dollar in cash is valued at 69 cents that's a 31 discount on the cash that's an astounding discount you have 10 billion I act like you're only 6.9 billion if you are advising this company they said how do I make my market price go up the advice is very simple right what should you do just give the damn cash back you know how much they'll resist you no we changed doesn't matter markets don't trust you give the cash back the discount will disappear but they will refuse and that's where a call I can't steps too much cash give me the cash say how much value is that you pick a company like this one you target the company and they return the cash that 31 discount you don't need to change the way they run the business and change the debt ratio all you need to do is get rid of that cash balance because people don't trust you that's is going to come from outside because managers left to themselves will don't want to give up cash they control the cash they can do things with it you need almost outside pressure on these companies to kind of say I mean what your best days are behind you you need Larry the liquidate dang it just give the cash back and if you look at high growth companies that are well above their cost of capital a dollar in cash is valued at a dollar 22. there is an advantage to Young companies money losing companies to have a cash balance remember that failure rate that I ask you for your company that failure rate is partly determined by how much cash you have the day pay TM and zomato and Airbnb did their IPOs they're fairly raindroptimatically you know what because the race cash they put it as a Cash Pad they added three billion dollars in cash you have enough cash now to cover the next four years you produce your fairly redfair that's why going public can overnight reduce your failure it's not because there's something magical but because you've augmented your cash balance so cash should be the easiest of assets and already while added some twist to it so don't do anything weird right now by taking your cash balance and discounting you have to think about it as you go through we have a company that gets 30 of its value from cash it's worth it now staying on this theme of simple to Value assets most companies that probably run into is their technology companies and manufacturing companies you've got to project cash flows you've got to Value the company but you know what a closed in mutual fund is the typical mutual fund is an open-end fund which means that if you send your money into Fidelity Magellan the number of units in the fund increases your net asset value is going to be whatever the value the fund is divided by the number of you so in on open and fun what do you what the what the net asset value of your holding is exactly equal to what what the fund is investing a closed end fund is actually a publicly traded company and what makes it unique is that the assets are all shares in other publicly traded companies since I bought shares in 10 companies that those are the odds should be the easiest of all companies to Value right just to add up the market capital and you'd expect these companies to trade at roughly close that number it's so easy to Value them but a typical closed in fund trades at about a 15 discount on the market value in fact when the first papers were not enclosed in front it was called the closed and fun puzzle you know why the word puzzle is thrown in right because there seems to be an easy Arbitrage opportunity which is what by the entire closed in fund for 85 percent of the value liquidate it and keep the extra 15 we need to change the notepad you can change it to an open-end fund and the discount should disappear and there are some closed in funds 15 of funds where that happens every year but the other 85 percent because of the way governance is set up or taxes because remember you sell the stocks at you don't get to keep the environment you still have to pay taxes there are frictions but the question is why do they trade at a discount I think the answer is already there right why did we Discount Company B's cash because we didn't think they could earn what they needed to make if you put your money in a mutual fund what's your expected return what do you expect the fund to make let's say it's a it's a it's a van it's a it's a it's a fund that invests in large market cap companies it invested roughly what the S P 500 makes right in other words if you're value invested there's a value index fund that I could use basically there are and we know that if you look at the history of Active money managers they've had a tough time earning that required the typical Act of money manager underperforms the index by about one and a half percent so when you put your money in a closed in fund you know what you're doing right you're effectively saying hey you know I'm going to make one and a half percent less than I should make so if my cost of equity is there eleven and a half percent and I think you're making to make only 11 think of what that translates into you're going to make half a percent less I'm going to Discount your funds just like I discounted cash for the fact that you will not earn what you need today and the worse I expect the fund to do the bigger the discount is going to be so if you look across course close in funds about 20 traded premiums 80 traded discounts and the discounts can be as large as 40 to 45 percent for some which are usually you know headquartered in the Cayman Islands or some place where governments is really messing and they have a history of underperforming markets so we get a chance to pull up 10 closed and funds look at the history look at the discount our wage of funds whichever history of underperforming other ones are traded the biggest risk but if you're close to the fight that beats the market you know what you're going to do right if you expect it to keep beating the market you're going to actually trade at a premium both and I'm going to use a company that you don't think of when you think of closed in funds to illustrate this process we mystified Berkshire partly because of Warrant of its placement but let's think of basically what Berkshire Hathaways it's an insurance company that takes collects premiums and those premiums get invested in a bunch of companies this is true for every insurance company every insurance company has an insurance business part and a mutual fund product basically a closed and fund on the other side in most insurance companies the insurance part that drives that if you're all at stake you basically say if you're a good insurance company I'm going to give you a premium but on the fun side you expect them to kind of match the market they're not they're nothing special but Berkshire Hathaway is an insurance company that at the best regarded fund manager in history running the closet you know what this is going to create right historical books are Hathaway you look at the book value books are happening the reason for a long time Hathaway is just market value of companies so Coca-Cola it's marked to Market Berkshire Hathaway used to trade a two and a half to three times Book value you should tell people you buy boxer Hathaway you're buying Coca-Cola three times the market price right that's effectively what you're doing but you're doing it why because Warren Buffett is there is going to keep making great companies so I'm going to show you a graph that kind of captures what's happened to Berkshire Hathaway over the last 20 years you look until the late 90s Berkshire Hathaway trades at a premium so The Price to Book ratio for books are out to a much higher than the typical insurance company but over the last 20 years if you look at what's happened in the company it's become more like a typical insurance company the premium seems to have disappeared but the introduction of the teacher that I think nobody even just buff he could do whatever he wants people don't even think about it the anterior motive so I remember introduce the B shares people said oh it's Buffett he must have a good reason for doing it it's not the BuyBacks whichever much money is for the best you know but it's been big for a while right you're right it's getting bigger that scaling is working there's probably a very simple how old is no will he die one day I'm not being morbid here I think he will right you know what's happening markets are not stupid they're looking at a 91 year old and a 97 year old on the stage Charlie Munger and Buffett and saying you know what this too shall pass the discount reflects it in fact a decade ago Buffett actually officially said he wasn't going to pick companies anymore he hired these two guys and he said nobody ever hear us from them Todd Combs I mean I never see his name in the news he's not on the you know the Buffett premium is unique you can't pass it on just because you said I picked a good guy there are lots of other issues I think value investing itself has hit some Crosswinds but what you're seeing there is a reflection of the expectation of there is no buffered premium left because he's not going to be around for much longer you think about personality driven companies we think about musk and Tesla but the reality is Berkshire Hathaway because of the nature of its business has always been better enough that's the premium that you're getting on the closer in fact that premium is now gone Berkshire Hathaway is a very good insurance company and it's a decently run close land closed land fund but it's not special anymore so that's a cash block let's move on to crosswords cross Holdings test your accounting because the way accountants treat cross Holdings it's all over the place broadly speaking across sorting can be classified into one of three groups it can be a minority passive investment what's a minority passive investment you own three four five percent of the company and you take no role in how the companies are basically just a holding you can have a minority active investment you own 15 of a company of somebody in the board of directors you have some role in how the company is run all you have a majority or where you want sixty percent of the company you know how the accounting works if you have a minority passive investment all you have to show is the dividends you receive from that investment as part of your income statement let me repeat that again the dividends you receive and what do you have to show on the balance sheet is what you originally invested to get that hold to show you how disconnected this can be from reality I remember an older version of SoftBank in the 1990s which at one point in time got 50 percent of its value from one holding for holding in Yahoo because they're an early Venture capitalism it was almost 50 by yourself if you looked at softbank's income statement though because it was classified as a minority passive investment you know what he'd have seen how much should Yahoo pays dividends in the 1990s yeah zero you don't see nothing you see that's okay I'll see it in the balance sheet you'd have seen the 50 million they're originally invested for a seven billion dollar holding minority passive as uncommon thank God for that but it's completely disconnected from reality then you have minority active Holdings minority active Holdings should take a stake in the company you have some role in how the company is Right you've got to use What's called the equity approach this is the predominant approach that most companies do with cross Holdings an equity approach in your income statement you have to show 15 of the net income or net loss better than dividends keys and in your balance sheet you have to take your original investment and adjust it for retain it's like an updated Book value to reflect what's happened since a little better than mine and then you get the majority Holdings accountants flip out the old 60 of another company what are you required to do in both IFRS because sorry I've never understood the logic of this what does consolidation mean when you do revenues got to act like you have a hundred percent of the subsidiary Services only 60 of the Carnage is don't worry about you're operating income 100 operating income only 60 don't worry about it then you get to the assets you gotta count 100 of the cash only 60 in the accountant says don't worry about it then at the very end of the process your content wakes up and says you're only sixty percent and so that's what I've been trying to tell you all this time you don't own 40 percent genius we've got to show the 40 that doesn't belong to you and hence is born one of the worst named items on the badge it's called minority interest or non-consolated interest what is it capture it captures the 40 that doesn't belong to you but it shows up as a liability why because you counted a hundred percent you're trying to fix your problem already you can see the first step in dealing with cross Holdings is you got to understand the accounting because now you've added layers of choices joint ventures some of them now allow partial consolidation which means you're going 55 in some companies you mark to Market SoftBank now has to Mark the market because it's viewed as holding these companies for trading but Microsoft does the first step in dealing with cross Holdings is going through the accounting and trying to figure out how exactly are these people estimating the value of crossover and in a perfect world let's talk about how you value passwords in a perfect way where you were doing things from scratch here's what I would do I'd value the parent company standing alone take out all the crossovers that way I can give it the growth the cash flows I can focus on the parent company then I take each subsidiary it doesn't matter whether it's minority majority value that's subsidiary from scratch with its own flash flows growth and risk and then count the percentage of each one that belongs to it so the ultimate valuation of the value of the parent company plus three percent of companies subsidiary B plus seven percent substituency plus sixty percent of subsidiary this is the advantage of doing this you're treating each company individually you're not consolidating them you're giving them each their old cash flows growth and risk you can do each one in a different currency right one can be U.S one can be Japanese company you're not trying to do it all in one month but it does require information what's the information you need you need information on your company's parent company steps most many multinationals would report we report both a parent and a consolidate but some report only Consolidated you don't even know choice but you also need full financials on every subsidiary that you have but here's the problem you're going to face that's not going to be easy to get most colleges I'll tell you a story to illustrate how messy crosswords can be in the late 90s I was writing a Japanese company one of my valuation books I'm battling a Japanese company we're always teaching on the edge of disaster because Japanese and risk free rate was so much lower than rates elsewhere in the world that you had to be careful about the growth rate so it was be careful I finish I'm patting myself in the back for a job well done when I take a look at the company's financials they report they have 227. cross Holdings remind me again to Value this company what do I need to do I need to Value 227 other companies I am way too lazy it's the kind of company I say look I'm not investing in the company it's too much work to do but let's say I'm not a lazy person that I'm willing to take the path of it I couldn't have done it in this company for a simple reason 60 of the 227 companies will publicly trade so I could get the financials the other 167 what private companies with zero information provided any of the operating units or revenues and operating income nothing so I call the investment relations officer of this Japanese company she's very polite as Japanese I want to be but completely opaque so I said look I'm wearing a company it's not for an expose I would like some information on the cross home and she said I cannot give you that information it is proprietary the way she said proprietor is kind of scary they said okay what if I bought a thousand shares in your company and then called you she said it's still be proprietary I said that doesn't make any sense to me you're refusing to tell me what I know she thought about it for a moment you have a point but it's still proprietor at this point I'm bagging my head against the wall I'm ready to hang up the phone she said wait I can't tell you something about these crossworks I'm expecting something like revenues or operating in I said what she said I cannot give you specifics but they're worth a lot I said I'm sitting here with an Excel spreadsheet with a cell next to cross soldings I'm trying to enter lot but I keep getting error messages below how many zeros are there in a lot but this cuts to the heart of the Cross holding culture right which is what do managers want to do they want to hold up a brown paper bag they trust me it's full of cash they can I look in the bag no it's full of cash I'll tell you exactly how much take my word and as long as we take their word for it why are they ever going to let you look in the back we get the companies we deserve so when I hear company you know investors in some marketing companies will Market they've crossed holy they won't tell it you know easy way to make them reveal what the crosswords give the cross orders a value of zero you know what that's going to do it's going to smoke out the people with valuable cross Holdings and no no microsolutions are not who are zero here I'll show you what they would but as long as you say I'll take whatever you show on your balance sheet the value of your cross Holdings we're not going to get the information but in a perfect world let's see how this would work so this is a few years ago when Yahoo was still an operating company if you remember 2013 14 it was towards the end of its life Marissa Meyer and just communist CEO she was going to rescue the company because of her days at Google I decided to do an intrinsic valuation of the company and what made Yahoo unique is by the time you got to 2014 there was a Yahoo the operating company which operated a search engine that nobody searched on an email program that nobody used you know so basically the company is reaching the end of its life but in two crosswords one was in Yahoo Japan which for whatever reason the Japanese like to use Yahoo they're still operating as a lucrative business and as a standalone company with its own financials and the other of course was an investment that Yahoo made a decade earlier in a company called Alibaba in 2014 as you know Alibaba Republic has a 200 billion dollar company so I valued each piece separately and I was able to do this because Yahoo is a standalone company I was able to get the parent numbers Yahoo Japan was a standalone Japanese history I was able to and this was right after Alibaba filed for their IPO so the Prospectors were done so I did an intrinsic valuation of each of the three companies so that I'm running three companies to get the value one so each one and value the operating assets add cash subtract now that that's Yahoo's parent Equity 7.4 value I get the value of equity in Yahoo Japan 21 billion 35 of that and Alibaba I did an intrinsic valuation in 20. this was before the IP there was no market price 22.1 add the three numbers up again the one caviar curator is if Yahoo sells Alibaba holding which was required to do because the agreement they had with Alibaba there would be a capital gain so I've factored that in saying look if I cut I'm going to count that as part of my value I've got to factor in that the day after they go public there's going to be a set that's a five billion dollar taxes due but this is an intrinsic valuation all the way through I'm valued parent company and valuing the subsidiary but I'm able to do it because I have the financials this is the exception not the rule most of the time you're going to be able to get only some of the information you get the parent company but not the subsidiaries and the question is what do we do in The Limited information that we have and I'll give you two choices one is um if you and so I would do this for both minority and majority Holdings is if you have publicly traded companies the 16 let's go back to the example of the Japanese company 227 crossovers that's how I'm too lazy I don't have the information the value or 27. for the 60 publicly traded companies what's an escape hatch I can use just take the market price add it on I'm cheating right because I'm adding a pricing to an intrinsic valuation but I'm saying look at how much work it says and for the other 167 companies who have only a book value I could try to convert it to a market value if I know what sect is your if you're a chemical company and a typical Capital company trades it what it's very sloppy it's a pricing but it's better than just taking both of it I'll take a pricing over a book value everything so the fact is when you look at these companies and you try to Value them you've got to work with the information you have and with the aqua actually ended up pricing order so here's what the pricing alternative looks like rather than do an intrinsic valuation of each part I applied a multiple in each one so I use EB to sales for each of the companies and adjusted for the fact that growth was different and here I'm doing the pricing of the parent company the subsidiaries most of the time when people talk about doing some of the parts valuation they're doing some of the Parts pricing very few items actually do a full switch valuation but I'm still trying to bring the parts in to my final advantage so I'm going to stop with that and when we when we come back after the break we're going to continue with the new sense but you know you have all the ingredients to do your intrinsic valuation if you have time on your hands especially in the next couple of days you want to get something started I would strongly recommend getting start that's the toughest part if you don't get started you can never get done I'm stating the obvious get started you get stuck at least you have know what you're stuck on you can think about what you do when you get back so have a great break I will see you when you come back on Monday and I will give you a break on emails my last email will come on Friday and for a whole week you will not hear from me I promise you but wait for the email a week from Friday because we're back I've got no other friends I'm gonna miss them questions were Sarasota okay because there was somebody maybe it was something that I did because I teach students so it might have been it might have been that I got there beginning tomorrow Friday before spring break starts yeah I can do after five minutes thank you what that is um oh yeah as long as both those numbers reflect that okay are targeted for unclosing okay liquidation exactly exactly and it's easier in some markets than others yes but I think you're absolutely right that's this that's the stress you create when you discount something where you can observe what you own and you're trading at a 20 discount unit there are close to an arbitrary funds the puzzle is that they don't succeed more often right because you'd expect this should be slam dunk 80 percent of the government if you think about this Persistence of closed and funds in reality closed and funds which have been discounted they're closing funds that have been disconnected for the last 30 years a lot of real estate closed and frustrated big discounts on the property the problem there's liquidating the assets is going to be really difficult to do so you can buy the fund but then you're not selling stocks you're actually selling real estate properties and you think are worth more than what you pay for five properties are in the same city then you're trying to sell them all at the same time who knows what kind of discount you'll have to get but it is a constant push of proposed but to me the puzzle is why so many of them continue to live in spite of all these people trying to discount them and the answer is to be the government there has to be governance the most interesting one was the point it has a listed fund um in London yeah and then it trigger better now um Gap and because again love is often over after this follow-up it was just so interesting to see an activist that we must have Target the closing fund and they're like haha the pot calling the kettle black somebody should Target inspired they did they did it was in the Ft like a while that's an interesting story the other thing I want to let me know is that I'm going in to get the insurance first it's for Christmas to be in but you know they say I mean sure you're going to go on the front side or the insurance the fun side I would prefer to be on the insurance like managing then all I would say so it's a hypocraticals don't try too hard I'm serious let's say it's an insurance company it's core value funds and insurance services yes okay there are the book Shadow is an exception to that rule yes I think when insurance companies get hurt is because people on the front side try to uh they want to be what I've learned about so they're reaching they're overreaching they're over investing they're concentrating they're making big bets on you know moonshots can be very careful if you're an insurance company you don't I mean your portfolio I pay you for consistency and being close to Market and keeping your costs low not for learning to Alternative asset classes because and unfortunately insurance companies are not immune from the kinds of pressure that everybody's investing in cryptos and they claim people making a lot of money you see precious building up within these companies we got to do that too yeah so I think my my advice is you know remember it's an insurance company fundamentally and your job is to preserve those premiums first very much of a you know preserved premium and you would of course deliver solid returns and if you can make my emails points on the market yeah that's the whole I hope to get my offer by the unknown good thanks good luck to you thank you all right thank you for having me early yeah it's a wonderful problem thank you wonderful to you I also brought you a small present foreign 
thank you guys foreign before you left in the break might be undervalued now anybody running first Republic value that kind of dead or whatever to change companies who knows First Republic by the end of this week you might have to do your own set of gymnastics but uh we're going to come back and talk about value bet because I think that now I tell people there's no sector I hate valuing more than bats and you can see why right you can do an intrinsic valuation but banking at its Essence is built on trust and the trust goes you can take the biggest bank of the way we all decided the JP Morgan Chase is going to go down tomorrow it'll go down tomorrow right there is no bank that consistent in fact it's the exact opposite of the Bitcoin Universe right the Bitcoin universe is built on no trust at all it creates incredibly inefficient mechanisms we create trust mechanisms because it allows us convenience and we leave our money in the bank we don't think about it most of the time unless it's in First Republic right now it is more than 50 000. no but you don't think about it which is the benefit of trust it allows us to carry on business and go on at the rest of our lives and you can see what happens if the trust gets shaken and I think this time around you have less trust to begin with because 2008 was the original shake up and I don't think the trust has ever fully come back so you can already see people's uh conspiracy theories that this has all been designed by the big Banks the big provisional Banks go down that nothing can be trusted it's a very dangerous place to be not just for banks but for an entire Financial system and this week is going to be interesting from that perspective in terms of how this plays out our first Republic by Wednesday is acquired does it stop there is there another bank that they will move on to and at the stage you know who benefits who you know what that can only be costs you know and even if some people better so no we'll come back and address what to do if you're valuing a bank and you worry about trust being skipped but today I want to talk about those last few cents in intrinsic valuation because partly because I want you to be able to clean up your own intrinsic valuations so let's start with our usual start of the classes today one of the things we're going to talk about is the difficulty of value some companies are more difficult why because they're complex they're in multiple businesses there are multiple countries so let's say comparing two companies so first companies in a single business has a very simple holding structure and is transparent economy you know what I mean by transparent accounting you read the financial statements you actually understand what they're doing the second company is opaque it's in multiple business it's a complex competition forget about everything in valuation think like an investor simple company complex company let's assume they're the same numbers same growth rates and cash flows you know which of these two companies would you value more highly a simple company or the complex company how many of you value this simple company more highly because it's easier to understand how many of you would value the complex company because you don't understand it very well and I phrase it that way it sounds weird but nobody if you open up any textbook and you start entering numbers what are you going to find same class cost for Capital save growth rate save cash flow you plug them in traditional valuation we actually value simple and complex companies equally and I think it's dangerous we assume evaluation that what you don't know can't expect why because you average we assume that what you don't know Cuts in both directions and that's I think a key assumption and that I think might be at the core of the prom because what you don't know is more likely to be bad news the company said hey guys we made five times more money than we told you we did notice when you get surprised it's almost always that you lost money rather than make money so we're going to come back and talk about what to do about complexity I'll tell you when my wake-up moment on this issue came about it wasn't right away it took me a while to get there um that's already priced it is investor kind of affect your value they're priced today the price is how are you going to incorporate that in your value right so pricing no no in terms of private in terms of like they understood it like I hope you don't understand that's fine but but if they don't fix it you still have to bring it into your evaluation right so they are so there's something bad going on even if they understand if you don't bring it into your intrinsic valuation that's what's going to happen you're going to come up with the value higher than the price and you're going to buy the shares right so that might actually be the most dangerous scenario if the modern investor understands it and prices it in and lowers the price and you're not bringing that in to your valuation you're going to find these companies systematically on the web so it actually makes things worse module versus comprised today when everybody is completely confused maybe you're in better shape because nobody really knows what's going on so I think the date most dangerous scenario and Insiders it's not even modern investors but inside is nowhere and they basically price it in and push the price down but you don't know and you're still keeping the value out of it so we'll come back and talk about the complexity issue here's the second issue I want you to think about okay and this is something that right now when you're talking about stress and liquidation is worth it let's suppose you do a discontinent evaluation of a company I'm sorry you do a discounted cash evaluation of a company you come up with a value of 100 million let's suppose it as dead outstanding with a face value of 100 million but the market value of this debt is 80 million so think about what makes the market value less than the face lab and I ask you to estimate the value of equity in this country sorry the choice if I do equities here in which case you're subtracting the face value of the debt from the estimated intrinsic value to the company or is it 20 million which is so the real question I'm asking you should I subtract our book value of that face value debt should I subtract that market value I'm willing to listen to both sets how many of you think I should be subtracting out the face value upgrade nobody everybody thinks we should yeah because they haven't repay the paid so that's the argument right I have to pay off the 100 million so guess what the market value is then it's not clear that they would be able to repurchase back as market price they make it let me play Never to Advocate right now almost every company's market value of 10 is lower than its Book value especially with this long done that why because the borrowed money in 2019 2020. right now interest rates are much higher right so when I compute market value debt I'm still making my payments but the present value of those payments at a four percent rate or five percent rate is lower so they are the reason the market value is lower than the book value simply because the interest rates have moved what's the second scenario where market value is going to be lower than what value expect nothing to do with interest rates if you're a bad shape you either be a distressed company right and there it gets more dangerous because if I subtract out the market value of debt for Bed Bath and Beyonce look My Equity looks good all you need is somebody who's more credit worthy coming in and buying the company that's what somebody trusts my evaluation somebody's credit for the transplant obligation buys Bed Bath and Beyond my estimated Equity value guess what's going to happen to that market value that the minute the Acquisitions done it's going to shoot up to the book value because that was so you can already see that whether you subtract our market value debt especially when it's a big distance most of the time it's not an issue market value book value closer but if they're different you gotta ask why is the difference purely interest rate moments there's no distress issue stick with the market back because remember those higher interest rates are being Incorporated in DCF how would the higher cost so you're incorporating the effects you have to be consistent so what you subtract are to get the value back but it can sometimes be a little dicey with distress confidence which brings me to my third and final thing that we're going to look at we're going to talk about stock based compensation let's become a big deal right over the last 30 years companies have increasingly shifted away from the traditional 1980s was almost unheard of ticket stock based conversation people are paid in 70 they got bonuses based on profitability but stock based compensation took off in the 90s you know why it took off the 1992 called Congressional compensation cap was written in terms of salaries and bonuses nobody thought about options and of all of a sudden it just took off and it was aided and embedded by absolutely stupid accounting and you're going to see in a minute what I mean by this let's assume you shareholders in economy 100 million shares outstanding trading at ten dollars per share I decide to get 10 million options to my CEO why because I really like the gun but the question the impact I said look I'm going to set the strike price on these options equal to the current stock price then I said don't worry I've given away nothing the exercise value is here is that true though what I said the value of the shares I you had before I did this was ten dollars now that I've granted these options I'll give you the three choices the person who can go along with myself say nothing's happened my value is still ten dollars how many of you to go over there refused to pay and actually got the options delivered right just because an option is that the money doesn't mean it trains for nothing there's a Time premium on the option when you give away options you're giving away value who's value they're giving away everybody they give it away stake of your equity and you can't cough up and use the third choice I'll wait till I see what happens because you've already paid the price so you've got to incorporate that into that into debt So today we're going to talk about stock based compensation how it started primarilies management options why it shifted away to restricted stock in most companies and how to incorporate the effects into better so we've locked on our agenda let's start with I think we were on page 229 of the slots if you want to get on the same page which I think would be a good idea so last said last class it was a long time ago so it'll be reviewed we talked about what to do with cash you remember and what did we say we should do with cash reserving your cashmere company most of the time I said do nothing but there would be times discount cash in the hands of a company and why is that what's the reason for discounting cash what kinds of companies would you disconnect poorly managed companies you don't trust the management of your cash in some cases you might attach a premium to the cash why if it's a small company in an Emerging Market it's Capital restrictions having cash will allowed to survive subsidiary separately and then add up the pieces why don't we do it because it's a pain in the neck you're 100 subsidiaries second you need the information to be able to do it and often that information is withheld to use shortcut to use a Price to Book ratio you apply a pricing to that to get drives so today I want to talk about a third issue you value the company you've dealt with cash you dealt with crossovers then you take a look at the balance terrible mistake the very fear the urge to start adding other stuff you know what I'm talking about because there's always you start with the most useless asset of all good what should I do with it it's that in God it's not an but then you start to see assets that really happen what do you have to do you have to take the number of rooms to the hotel estimate no occupancy rate estimated price you do all the stuff right project out the income they're going to make a software company native expense you get cash flows you can come up with the value of a half a bill for the world of history when you ask a real estate person what will that real estate be worth and he says 750 minutes so you got a half a billion per company as a hotel company 750 million for the real estate can I add the two together and say well you hold of the story is 1.25 million why not you can't have your cake and eat it too right you can't sell the real estate say guys can I run a hotel on this real estate that doesn't but no it doesn't work that way The Plaza Hotel became essentially Plaza Apartments because somebody bought the hotel and converted Apartments you can't have your cable needed too so you got to pick one of the two numbers so let me put you on the spot you're an investor and this is not uncommon this is I think true for almost all five star hotels you have a going concern values Hotel company called a real estate man and the real estate value is higher than the going concern value which one should you pick as your valuation you have to invest in the shares of government so anybody want to get that a shot and the reason is you don't get so the date you're going the higher the two values is you don't run the company so if they choose to run into the hotel you're stuck with the hotel cash flows so if you don't control the company you don't get to pick the higher of two numbers but if you could acquire the word of a story would your ads be different you'd get to decide what to do with it remember what I said about the plot that's exactly what the plaza buyers did is they bought the company for more than what it was worth as a hotel but less than what they thought was worth that real estate and apartments and they converted you can already see this is one of those elements of control the hotel business around the world because real estate prices especially Nation there isn't a single five-star hotel I can think of in Asia that's worth more as a hotel it changes the game entirely because traders in these companies trade on the real estate they don't trade on whether you're a good hotel valuation okay what's in the badge it's cash flows What's that name used for the building it's very reasonable to get to those revenues once you do that you can't count the land you can't count the building because that would be double Counting that's why when you value a shipping company after you're done with that you can't add the value of the ships and the value determinants because they don't you can't count them both you can talk them separately one is a liquidation pattern one is going good term value but you can't count them both the same average so you think what can I add on because you're you're desperate you want to push the value up in the 1990s Lord U.S companies are over funded pension Cuts somebody help me out there are two ways of pension plan to be structured in a company one is defined benefit the other is Define contribution but the difference between the two types of plants what do you get in a defined benefit plan a promise or fixed payments I agree to pay a thousand dollars a month once you retire a defined contribution plan you put the money it gets invested in whatever and you get whatever comes out you can't have over funding or underfunding with the defined better defined contribution plan but if you have a defined benefit plan because you've promised a fixed pension whatever money you collected you invest if that money gets to go off in value higher than you expected if you have an over funded pension in theory that belongs to shareholders you think why in theory you try to extract that from the pension plan you get this labor peace goodbye for the Next Generation so companies can't do it and there's a tax consequence you have to pay a hefty tax rate on but in the 1990s a lot of companies are over funded pensions you know what so the.com photographer it wasn't that they were doing something special stock prices went up the pension plan values went up and there were many Urban animals were added the Opel funded pension portion to the value of equity I didn't like it then because three years later you know what happened to that over funded portion right the market collapse and there was the over funding in general I would not add it it's not a good practice but it's nice to have an overfunded pension plan because it allows you to set aside lesson contributions at least within your term to cover the difference so what can you add on you're looking for completely what I call vacant assets acids that have value but that you don't use their operations and it's tough to think of a good example so I'm going to give you my favorite exactly anybody are part of the Michael price so I remember in 20 years ago when or 20 when Michael price sold his mutual fund in the Japanese I I never involved myself in asking for money but one thing I absolutely refuse to do but in this case I made an exception that we would go meet Michael price and ask him to fund this fund that mba's been run as an investment fund okay one time do you never ask me again so I went in and of course he seen in the fun and it's been around for the last 20 plus years you can see the returns that you made over time the road it's a rolling portfolio management right because each each class graduates a new group content and the Michael price fight is built on making pitches basically I don't know whether it's changing it so you know if you want to buy a stock you've got to pitch it to everybody else in the group and they have to agree that that's a good investment to make assuming you're the passion so but I've never officially involved myself with the phone but about 15 years ago now and a lot of people have got you know they're in the front go through this class but 15 years ago sitting in my office you know one of the people who's on the Michael price fund comes into my office now I'm facing a conundrum I very quickly turned into my computer at work remember no idea what do you start right but it was really another big word for confusion so it's okay what do you what's your connection I like the word I was going to use it on as many times I said I don't see a conundrum yet he said I've come up with a value of 240 million it's trading at 300 million as a market cap I said I still don't see a connection it looks over there let it go he said here's my calendar seventh time in the three minutes you had the conversation the word comes up he says there one big asset that they have that I haven't counted what do you think he was talking about remember the brand is what generates a Playboy bunny is the brand those are what generate the cash flows if I added the brand that'd be double count he what is it the Playboy match the Playboy Mansion belongs to Playboy and if you've ever driven by the Playboy rationality it's a huge problem one of the most valuable properties in ever it's worth about 150 million then and the question he was asking is can I add the 150 ml into my 240 Milli that's a conundrum why didn't come out and say that right often thought I don't know would it make Lego under that I said technically yes but you got a problem you got an 80 year old and a bathtub hanging out there you can't exactly throw a lot out of the street and I was talking about the fact that you have never still in the match what should I do questions why don't you check the actuary in payments so what am I checking for how long 80 year olds who surround themselves in 26 year old Playmates tends to live a lot of pressure on your heart you could kick the buck in any day that's in five years then you know what you need to do right take the value to one management five years from now discounted back five years you can get fancy you'd use a cost to Capital your real estate property for all I care and add that on I forgot all about this conversation a few years later I opened up the Wall Street Journal and as remember I said you can't have your cake you need to do Playboy managed to have their cake they sold the mansion to a Greek billionaire with Hugh Hefner in it I'm not kidding the condition was that Hefner would continue to live in the Mansion until he died and then this guy he said why would I have to pay that well I guess he wanted the glamor Dimension you know reflected Glory whatever it is maybe he planned to wear a bathroom and hang out in the mansion this is a truly very passion so when you think about what can I add on five years you add on things like branding writing this is my watering with accounting doing what it is and bringing things onto the boxes it's going to be this tendency to add on and double sound things that are already in your cash flows but it didn't ask that are truly valuable that I'm basically not just not unusualized now but never be utilized for this property those are the kinds of items you can add on because those are assets you have any questions another assets so now let's start with the complex function let's revisit that yeah if it's undefined we have to talk what should be included with that right because underfunding needs to drains your Equity value you've got to come up with more I'll give you two ways of dealing with underfunding in your list kind of cash flow evaluation you can do one on the other but you can't do work is there a bit of accounting and you can start thinking already about the two ways that you can show it up one is it you can show up as higher contributions you need to make to lower your cash flows in future years the other is you can show this debt outstanding to them and subtract that but I'm going to give you two rules of that one when you do cost recap and there I don't think you should include random funded pension plans and another in terms of the debt you subtract out to get evaluated let's talk about simple versus complex let's make the example that I start with class with more tangent two companies exactly the same number same cost you Capital same world trade tables or capital but the first company is in a single business is a very simple holding structure and it's transparently the second company is in multiple businesses has a complex holding strategy a special purpose entities and all kinds of difficult to understand voting structures but I also made the confession that in traditional valuation we make it such that what you don't know it's actually don't worry about it and then we had a company called title having a confidence guide those of you don't remember Taiko was a conglomerative group acquisition he said they use the debris accounting debris of acquisition you know what you do a acquisition good will it restructuring challenges to cover up a lot of bad stuff and it eventually blew up and took typo down 80 percent but that wasn't the story Thai could drop for 80 she lost 15 of itself basically what's one company got to do with the other how did I describe type of a conglomerate that grew through activation you see how YG was affected right investor said we got burned by typo how do we know GE is not doing and I was teaching this class in the middle of evaluation class and we brought this up and I raised this issue should we be punishing companies for being difficult to understand for being complex and everybody said we should and I said okay I'll work on what we need to do if we want to bring complexity into valuation first we need a measure of complexity we can't just say I know it when I see it so we need to measure complexity and second we need to bring that complexity into one of the numbers the cash flow of the world to the Discord great idea they said how should we measure complexity and they looked at me and said you're teaching the class why don't you come up with them so I did my first shot and they didn't like this is a group of 200 mbas and I think I was teaching in 260. um and I said here's how I'm going to measure complexity I'm going to count the number of pages in the parent q that are 10K I know it's incredibly simplistic but if there's a company you want to avoid value here which is the company you least want to touch I know which one I don't what the heck is it 1026 pages in a 10K this isn't War and Peace this is how many pages it takes them to tell me what happened in one year you're one heck of the screwed up company it takes you a thousand pages to get here [Music] we want something more sophistical I said you're right what was that that'd be back back next session I came back next session what I call my valuation  list these are all the things that it bugged me when I valuable company and I created a spreadsheet a company that came to be geographically Diversified but doesn't tell you when or they tell you where but you don't just you know you can't you don't uh you don't recognize any of the regions of the world it's like a lot of you Lord of the Rings Universe I've never seen that what is that foreign if you are the landlocked countries but you can see when you mix together Australia and Indonesia in the same group you see the problem you're going to create how do you come up with an equity risk premium that captures both countries we do things happen to be remember EMA we talked about this so I took all these things that Bobby came up with the score and I said the highest or the more complex economy but do you like this more they said yes this is so much better this is why we pay 150 000 for an FBA I think it does come with a small cost or a big cause to come up with the score for City Group what do I need to do three 1026 pages and I will no move to do that but each of you is wearing a company this semester right they could see the train coming at them down the track too late to get out of the way they should have picked a number of pages I gave them as an option they said yes and I said this semester in addition to having a company why did you come up with it wasn't a question you didn't eat it they said what choice did they have so that's investigation about the company that could come into the complexity School it's good that I did that because we learned some very interesting things first there seem to be no correlation between company side and complexity going in I thought big companies would be complexion in fact there was small companies that were incredibly complex and big companies were incredibly simple second Emerging Market companies over 20 to 30 percent more complex and developed Market companies usually because of cross-olding structures a lot of family group economics third any company that grew through Acquisitions it was almost automatically 30 to 40 more complex and some of you might be finding this out the hard way because you picked a company that goes through acquisitions it's much more difficult to do valuation because acquisitions tend to be lumpy you do an acquisition you don't do one that's two years and finally they found that any company with the financing on was significantly more complex than it currently with that one you know what I'm talking about right gmgmac for Ford cap you think what's wrong with that you've taken a bag you put it right in the middle of a Manufacturing Company it said trust me all the debt belongs to the back how the heck do I do so they came up with complexity Sports the most complex company in the class that semester was Gene under heavier the courier company but I did first team I've told people look if I've been content there and my job is to deal with all the investment bankers who get sent out ahead here's what I would do but make them very cheap be like Groundhog Day very cheap the rest of Eternity day in and day out it's my definite and this is the OT now with the gec the pay limitation that OG 2016 business in 72 different countries grow through Acquisitions if you think about loading up every conceivable bad thing in valuation to company so you can go with the simplistic measure of counting the pages it's incredibly effective now you might count the the megabytes that a PDF file is the problems we have pictures that kind of loads it up but you can convert into Pages that'd be very effective or you can go with a more well you know Focus measuring complexity where you bring in organizations but once you measured complexity you still have a task to do right you got to bring it into one of the numbers remember we said the eight proposition if it does not affect the cash flows and it doesn't affect the risk it can't affect that so I'll give you the choices one is you know you can do what some are interested in the late 90 thing no complexion the good time for the steps to happen people ignore it because they assume what you don't can't hurt you then you go to The Other Extreme in a crisis you completely act like all these things are worthless with all these other assets or whatnot but the middle ground is you have to do your job and try to bring it so here are the choices you can adjust the cash flows haircut the cashews you know hair cutting the cash flows you take your expected cash flows you knock them down the problem is how much you know if they've done this kind of arbiter but if it's a more complex company it's probably low the cash second is you can adjust the discount rate maybe you can use a higher remember I said each month that picked a different video set this I spent a month in complexity I actually took the S P 500 and split it down 250 complex companies to set some judgment calls at 250 250 complex companies for how we could imply positive about 43 S P 500 I took the index level cash flows I didn't have to reach out the implied cost of equity for complex companies was about one percent higher than the implied cost of equity for Central companies you can then say okay I'm going to compute a class in Capital this screen rate with beta times risk it's a complex company and I had an extra one percent higher discounts lower variable complex companies the third is and this is my favorite device is remember for Global to create value you have to earn more than your cost of capital foreign but a very good company that makes well above its cost in capital they have no idea what they do or how they make money then my suggestion is bring those successor turns out to zero very quickly so you don't know how they're making access or drugs assuming they can keep doing that magical thing for the long term can get probably get you to draw in the late 90s one of the companies people used to pick to Value this class was a star company of those days and run and to a person every every person who picked and go to bed and come into my office and say this company makes billing but have no idea what they do they claim to be energy Traders but what does that even mean who you buying the power from who you sell it into why you'll be able to make all this money did all these special purpose entities through a lot of profit you no idea what they did so what should I do and this was well before we knew about the fraud at the heart I said look if you don't know how they make money you can't assume they can keep making that for the long term bring the accessory terms down there the minute you did that there was no way you're going to find Enron to be able to be on the bed so you said it's a technique to kind of bring It so whatever you do if you decide that your company is deserving of that punishment there's a place to show but it might also shorten that final judgment you make you find a company to be underway and you get ready to buy this it's a complex company the Lord I don't know remember the danger of doing that especially if you have doubts this becomes a way you can hide behind those steps as a final part of the month I think the last couple of days of the month I took the 100 largest market cap companies in the US and a rather aggressive Price to Book ratios for these companies again to return equity and growth three classic variables always drive president but I also threw in the number of pages in The 10K into the question somebody help me out too how do I read this minus .003 on the number of pages is your first client they walk and say our price the book ratio is only 0.9 how do we double it easy right not 300 pages of your 10K sounds facetious but remember steady group had a thousand Pages it instead came by Design it started the day City Corp the bank but traveler's group and insurance company and decide to become a financial Supermarket that would do everything so what's this regression say hey simplify the market doesn't understand you and this is the advice I would describe to every Money Center back today I think Money Center banks have become night maps to that there are too many unknowns too many pieces the puzzle that are opaque and my suggestions JP Morgan would be worth more broken up into Parts into Banking and and it'll never happen because JB Diamond once ruled the empire because there's too much you don't know let's talk about that there are two places in valuations the first is we need a foster care right you need to get to do cost to camera the second place is you need a debt to subtract out once you get the firm value to get the value and I'm going to give you two different sets of rules for the two cameras when you do cost of capital the debt you should use you should be circumspect about your definition of that your name your definition of debt should include all interests bearing liability at least come in and you should stop as opposed to doing what you want to see other stuff showing up in the balance sheet under funded pension oblate you're going to be tempted because the conservative part of you say bring that into debt but the reason you should be careful is if you bring all of that stuff into that you're going to make your debt ratio higher what are you going to do your classic apple you're actually going to make your cost of capital loan so when you do cost to Capital keep your debt definition there all interest bearing that leading commitments stop right there see but I'm worried I'm worried I've underfunded pension obligations I'm worried because I'm in a target of a lawsuit that I could use when you get to subtract out the debt then the rules change the first is when you talk about Book value market value that I stated earlier if the market value debt is lower than the book value simply because of interest rate movement stay with the market value there's really no upset to go even but its market value debt is lower than the book value debt because there's distress in your company you've got to be cautious because whatever Equity value you see could be a mirage because the minute that credit worthiness comes back the debt is going to bounce back and back and you could be left with that Equity work now but this is your last chance right to deal with anything else that worries you so if you do have underfunded pensional obligations everything this is your chance to subtract it out say look I'm going to take it out of my value Equity because I need to come up with this money unless of course you can get the most companies no longer offer defined benefit this is the legacy of the 20th century and many of those companies especially automobile companies have looked at the government for a bit but if you don't get that it has to come out of equities you subtract it but does it trickier component which is if your company is starting loss let me rephrase it if you're a U.S company when your company is talking in a lawsuit it's not a question of now if you've been investing in tobacco companies for the last 30 years this has been front and sent why because tobacco companies have this this this effect hanging over them up you know at least for the first half of these these last 30 years of lawsuits against them because of cancer that could be five billion six billion eight billion I don't talk about what happened Midway through but for the 1990s evaluated by a company almost every single one of them would look underwear until you brought the fact that there are all these lawsuits out there if I lose them I could end up losing 10 billion 15 billion 20 billion so what should you do with those find a good trial this is nothing to do to the economics because now you're talking about what is the chance of a loser loss what do the appeals process look like what do the end payment look like in premature what happened in the middle of the 30 years it was Congress actually offered to conduct companies a deal where they paid tens of millions of dollars into a fund and they were relied on much of the lawsuit liability that they would have so that's actually an easier problem because now the money's actually been made tangible you know exactly how much you subtract out and it's not just tobacco companies for about four or five years Mark's stock price was driven by violence from 2007 2008 you had all these cases with Black Ops creating side effects billions of dollars in payments over the last five years what happened in Bayern the German you know Chemical Company because it bought Monsanto and what about one of the worst Acquisitions of all time the CEO buyer should never be allowed to run another company ever again after that acquisition because when they bought Monsanto they bought themselves around that classrooms which in a sense could potentially bankrupt anybody I think they've eventually figured out some kind of you know payout tens of millions of dollars but until that payout comes you have to set the light you're losing the lawsuit and what you will have to pay because of that what I'm trying to say whatever worries you have this is your last chance to deal with it right but it's regulatory payments you might have to make lawsuits you can lose or underfunded health care or pension obligations bring the market which brings us to the last two set which is stock based compensation stock based compensation before we get anything you know that I think was it last year that Amazon was the largest well maybe two years ago you know this this used to be a school where almost everybody ended up and was it Traders When you entered a Goldman and those days have shipped so I think about two years ago the largest employer here was Amazon increasingly tech companies are competing with banks at the top businesses and many of these tech companies are younger tech companies lots of props the Ubers are the words the snowflakes there's a long lead in here but why do companies use stock-based compensation you could get this long-winded incentive you have nothing to do with making incentives match up it's because they don't have the cash a snowflake cannot compete against involvement sets and pay you three hundred thousand dollars yeah because they don't have 300 000 cash so what do they do they offer you a hundred thousand a year plus stock options this is not bad it's because it so they're using stock based compensation as part of compensation language I thought it was a long lead what do we do with the rest of conversations means between the best cost of console already debut stock based compensation what should you do the logic is impeccable you need to be treating them like expenses find the accountants are doing this because the longest time they didn't but they are expenses and because their expenses the lower your income the fact that they're not casually neither here nor there they're in kind expenses like running a pizza store where because you don't have the cash you hand our whole pizzas to your employees and take them home say no cost it's a cost so let's get that out of the way there are two big questions we have in stock based competition one is what do we do about past grants of stock because your company's been giving out options in a restricted stock for as long as it's been in the face of the Earth what do we do with that dead weight across that's hanging over them and what do we do about the fact that they're not done yet and they want to keep doing this in the future and I want to deal with the questions separately but I also want to deal with the two forms in stock based conversation today starting in about 2007 and 2008 it recently stock based conversation is taking the form of restricted stock he said what are restricted from the shares in the company that come with the Restriction the Restriction is you cannot trade or share so sell those shares for X number of years first we have the best in most companies you know you have to stay with the company for a period of time for those so and but once you're invested you still might not be able to trade the shares three or four or five years that's a restricted shot there's shares without but they're effectively shares in the car why why is this an easy problem to deal with if a company grants restricted checks you know what I'm going to do I'm going to count it as part of my Share account and then the fact that they might be slightly less valuable because of the lack of liquidity I'm not going to make a big deal about it because you can always go and borrow against market value the shed hope and pray the market value doesn't collapse restricted shares and easier profit because like any other shares the the Medicare problem is when you give out options remember the example I gave to you which is you know you could add options or at the money he said what's the big deal but no it's not a big deal right but they some of them will get exercise and what are the conditions under which option to get exercise the share price goes up or share price goes down it goes up and they get exercise and they get exercise at a price lower than the stock price that's really an important problem is not that you're giving away shares they're giving away shares at a discount in the future you think but they could end up being at a premium it's true right but they're options you can't go and collect that so you can't go to the management and say buy the shares at the lower price it's a one-way deal so I want to talk about the options a lot because the options have to be done in one of two ways one is that you let the people exercise in the prevailing market price which is going to create a deletion effect right because they're going to buy the shares at 30 discount or 40 discount on the stock price what's the other what do companies do they buy back shares and they hold the shares but either way it hurts you right that buyback comes out of your cash flow so there's no Escape actually right the equity investors one way or the other you haven't paid these options so I'm going to start with a very simplistic example of option give me the three ways in which animals deal with options ranging from what I call the bludgeon approach which is what most analysts use to a treasury stock approach which has its own flaws to what I think is the right way to deal with options so let's set up the exam let's assume you have a hundred million infinity percent and 100 million shares outstanding and a billion dollars in debt so first I'm going to Value them for 100 million cash flows eight percent coffee Capital three percent growth rate give me a value for the firm of two billion I subtract a dedicated by the equity of a value I divide by the number of shares I get 10 dollars per share now I'm going to drop the board by granting 10 million at the money options to my CEO and this is the question answered what will happen when I per share and of course the accountants until 2007 would have said don't worry these options are worth nothing because they're at the money the value pressure should be uninfected you can already see the logic doesn't work on it but that was the sales the second is options do affect your value but the question is about how much the bludgeon approaches what you do you take the 10 million you add it all to the 100 it's called the fully diluted approach take the total number of shares you divide the billion by the 110 million say my share price value should go down by about 10 percent why is it the production because when you exercise these options cash comes into the company right you're ignoring that but you just adjust the number of shares for options on inspired so I'll give you a way of getting around it seems like an easy fix but then we'll talk about the right way to deal with options so I'm going to take you through three approaches for dealing with options as I said I take the blood and approach first you take the term value you divide by the total number of shares understand with the 10 million options included you come up with a value per share of nine dollars and nine cents the reason you're always stating the effect of the value of your equities you're ignoring the cash that's going to come in when these options get access so it's an easy way to fix that but these options you're going to get a hundred million dollars in cash coming in right so the second approach here's all like here's what I do I take the 100 million that I'm going to get from the from the exercise of these options and I'm going to add that on to the billion which gives me in this case extra 100 million dollars in cash he divided by the number of shares and this is almost Magic the value per share remains unchecked already you can see what the pressure you start to approaches use right it ignores the time premium of the options so the the budget approach understates the value of your equity because you're just adjusting the number of chairs the treasury stock approach overstates the value of your equity because you're ignoring the time premium there must be a Goldilocks series which is You can predict the time frame above the options here I should be able to get a much better sense of the value of the airplane what does that mean how do we bring in the time treatment option well after 1971 that's what you had to do but starting in 1971 option pricing models do exactly that they bring in the time premium with the option by incorporating the fact that there's variance in the stock price and therefore there's an upside so the third profit you do is you value the options options sounds like a weird thing to say but you value them as option not based on exercise value if you look at the remaining time left of the option the very the stock price you value the options as options you subtract that value from your Equity value do you see what because those options are a piece of your Equity you gave away and then you divide whatever is left over by the 100 million shares in order to share so you don't play games with the share options are not zero one secures but they're not shares under their exercise their intermediate Securities and this way you bring that in to the value of the ownership all I need to do is take these options and apply an option for pricing right and maybe that option pricing marks and option pricing mods are actually among our valuation models the ones that are most precise because most of the inputs are given the SDK the r the T maybe the sigma has to be estimated because it's a derivative secure but it's one catch the original option pricing models were designed to value options listed on the Chicago Board of options listed options and let's go through those characters those listed options tend to be short tend to be shorter so option pricing models are designed by two months three months six week options employee options are long term you're saying so what the assumption that the variance will not change might not be a big deal with the three month option but with the tailor much more dangerous second when you buy an option on the Chicago Board of options and you're exercising the company has nothing to do with it right it's somebody the other side so the winners and losers but the company is assigned there but when you have employee options they get exercise the share can't actually changes the very Act of exercising options can affect the stock price do you imagine that CEO with 10 million options exercising the option of the stock price goes to 18 the minute that that exercise happens there's going to be a delusion and third with listed options you almost never get Early Access twice see if I call option in IBM or in Microsoft and let's say the stock price goes up that's right right but rather than access the exercise almost always more Optimum it's not the option because there's a Time premium on the auction which means you can value these options using what are called European option pricing models which is what the traditional black shows is because nobody exercises before expiration a very convenient can you do do the same thing with employee options let's say you're an employee a test became an employer the market cap is 115 billion the market cap goes to 1.2 trillion you know this is too good to be true can you sell your options employee options are not trade and people have tried to set up trading platforms and the companies come down on it very strongly they're not tradable you know what's going to happen right if the stock price gets 1.2 trillion you think it's too high because you can't sell the option and you still wanted to cash out what do you do you get early exercise so three places where employee options become more difficult they're more long-term than a typical listed option I think that can create a dilution effect and most of them get exercise before expiration but those are fixable props you can take an auction pricing model and adjust it for the dilution and to explain how what this means here's what I'm going to do if you take the stock price of ten dollars the strike price of 10 of the example that I just gave the option looks like it's at the month but if I adjust for the fact that exercising is often a great dilution the stock price gets adjusted down to 958 essentially I'm adjusting for the expected dilution of the option which will lower the radical cost if I'm worried about early exercise I can think of maturity and maybe even use a five-year material difference in fact I tend to use half of the average maturity of employee options when I'm adding the options because options get exercised about halfway through maturity for most of these colleges both those adjustments are lower than that of the option but there's still going to be an option here are the option value that I ended up with for this option was 5.42 cents remember I gave away 10 million options it's 54.2 million dollars if you get a chance take a look at the option grant that the Tesla board gave Elon Musk in 2018. it was triggered by what the stock price had to be so it's not like they were not rewarding for doing that I think this is the magnitude of the of the number of options here the transient billions of dollars not hundreds of millions billions of dollars but basically that's what we're trying to do so now I'm ready to do the right thing so I'm going to go back to my original example remember I've added value I'm going to subtract out the value of the option the 54.2 million I'm going to come up with 945.8 million and I'm going to divide that 945.8 Million by the 100 million shares I'm standing to come up with a value machine 9.46 you think when will that happen with kids the minute the company announces it's giving 10 million options at the money you're going to see the stock price drop because as a forward-looking shareholder I've got to bring that into my valuable share today say look you just gave away something of value you're never estimating particularly on the 54 minutes that's 34 million dollars less spawning now let's talk a little bit about what account is used to do and what they do now and how that might explain the shield to restricted Style I told you options took off in about 1992. I don't know tech company booked.com everybody gave options there were three cards an accountant's agent embedded them by saying if you read at the money options it's a zero expense ccy College giveaway menu and after the fact three years they didn't get these options being exercised oh my God see you got a 350 million dollar package it took 15 years to convince accountants to do the right thing starting in 2007 when you give options you got to Value the options using an option pricing model it's now become part of the the toolkit for anybody who does accounting now you've got to be able to Value the options you've got to show it as expenses in the year that you've grabbed the options and all of a sudden magic and the freeness of options disappeared and that's where we saw the shift restricted started but to show you that you can lead a horse to the water and how to make it print what what do animals do the targets are not doing the right thing right they're trading stock based compensation is mixed pets reducing the earnings it reverse the whole damn thing we sometimes wonder they do the same thing with pizzas I mean stupidity must be just built in so deep into their thought processes that they continue to reverse things that are the right thing so maybe we should let accountants do the wrong thing because others don't seem to care so when you think about what to do with options essentially treat them as a grant of equity and you're very quickly going to see a path to the right thing so that takes care of the deadweight cost of auctions in the past you're saying what about the fact that companies can grant options in the future do the right thing instead of options are compensation expenses if you expect a company to continue to Grant options the future you know what you should do show it as an expense lower your income don't add it back to the non-cash expense it's an in-kind expense it'll lower your future earnings and cash flows and the reason I would separate the two is there are some companies that used to give stock based compensation a lot and have stopped for the most part some companies that used to give stock based competition the password will continue to do so in the future and in some companies which have never granted stock-based compensation than bad but we might do so in the future so you have to deal with two separate problems one is job-based compensation in the past and the other stock based compensation in the future both will lower the value of your Equity you're counting for two different effects so any questions on the stock based limitation so we're done with the mechanics evaluation I'm going to return back to the theme that I started as transcript at every valuation is a story it's in a way I describe it evaluation to the bridge between these stories and numbers so let me start to add some flesh to that story left to our own devices we're going to go to our preferred spot so we are a number cruncher you're going to go with the number 13 we're going to build Excel spreadsheets you're going to make them more and more complex there's storytelligent they're bigger and bigger stories and left to our own devices we're going to operate under our own delusions so this is a pushback on working on unions so what I'd like to do is take you through the process of going from scoring numbers and this is a process I go through almost every one of my valuations and the reason I'm going through it is because I teach myself for this process because I'm a natural number Branch I feel the urge to open spreadsheets and computer ratios and I have to slow the process down and say you've got to go to Google schools so there's no see magic to this process you don't have to follow the same project you got to figure out your own way to break in both sides whether it's snowflake or whether it's Amazon or whether it's you know JPMorgan Chase said is what I call surveying the landscape understanding the company the business within the competition it's not magic you can't value your company if you don't know what it does if you don't know what the market is serving is and what the competition does so what I'm going to use to illustrate this process is a company that I value 10 years ago where I learned a great deal more about storytelling and connected to numbers than any other company I've had it's evaluation is it a Uber in June of 2030. the groundwork what triggered my index group was a Wall Street Journal Store their Uber had raised money from Venture Capital sort of priced the company at 17 bit and I make a confession I've never heard you live underground technically I didn't I took the subway everywhere I never took car service I thought no let me take that back I said it never heard an Uber that's not technically true because my son who was going to college in North Carolina was using Uber using my credit card to back up whatever he was doing the movie but I thought he was taking German language classes you should have taken her way so so but I look at everything it's coming what does it do so my task is laid out for me right I can't value the company but I don't know what it is yeah so guess what I call it first I said but he was sleeping it's only 11 30 in the morning but he kept what I call him college student Towers which have nothing to do with the sun coming up and the sun going down it's got to do it whenever the bar is closed and whenever you go to bed and he wouldn't pick up his phone so I called my knees who lived and worked in Chicago and she was technically awake why what a man takes she was at the desk horrible mood clearly because she hadn't slept a good night talk to a mother about this Behavior but I did download the app sitting in my office upstairs hit the app magical things start to happen the GPS opens up and I see a car trying to drive towards me why New York City you don't get to the point A to point B in this truck with zaging and zagging we'll do one-way streets closed streams and I can see the name in the car it says George I've never seen this with the Yellow Cab fascinated I want George and his car to navigate their way in front of 44 West 4th Street they say hi George he says you don't enter the destination where do you want to go I said nobody can you drive me for about 30 minutes have some questions to ask he thought it was a serial killer for a moment and then he said you know when you spawn enough I can take you get in the back system these are not my car I said but you must be an Uber employee right I'm an independent contractor I said what are you doing he's having a regular job and I don't make enough money in it I already own this carb insurance and this allows me to earn a second income that supplements my basement that's interesting but why do you need to learn he said in New York City it's legal to stop on the streets and offer somebody around it that's actually true there's all these rules against Gypsy cabs he said what connects me with customers so that's interesting and now I couldn't understand why this guy grew up so 30 minutes later he dropped me off and I offered to pay he said you don't have to pay me I said it's free then it's not free when you do when you download the app and they ask you for a credit card I said yes they'll charge you so how do you get it give me quite a percent I mean they could be eighty percent of Japan why eighty percent he said I don't know that's what they already do drugs off at this stage I could see why Uber did what they did the connecting cars to customers they got to keep that's a sweet business to be which left me with one final question why do people like my son and my niece like so I called my son again at college yes sir this time at 3 30 in the afternoon no excuse to sleeping still see he's awake and I put him on the defensive right away he said you own a car it can call it why do you need the user right I acted like I knew what Uber was right why do you want to use right sharing service He says Dad on Friday nights and Saturday nights I really like Cooper now there are some follow-up questions you don't ask as a parent I kind of got it I said I mean this is a kid who would never call a yellow cat but it's not even in this frame of reference so what do you like about Uber he said I can call the car from the bar that's a plus because wait forever right you know they come sooner than I can it's cost a lot more right he said they're cheaper than I can the cars must be filthy right now the cleaner that I got I said let me get this straight they come sooner than a cab they're cheaper than a cab and they're cleaner than a cab I knew that cab service was destined for two the convenience the fact that let's face it the Yellow Cab system is in 1920th Century system it's a 19th century system right I can almost visualize people call it horse carriages hey come on over and that's how you call it yourself which left me with one final question what's so special about Uber why couldn't I go down into my basement get a big computer connect cars to customers and I can think of two things that Uber had that I do one with three billion dollars which is what they raised from the VC and they added I did not a little bit of a disadvantage there the second is this is the business with networking it's kind of a buzzword but you know what that means right usually as companies get bigger it gets more difficult to get the extra customer you got to work hard well companies with networking benefits as you get bigger it gets easier to get that extra Customer because you go where the action is if you're a driver you drive for the biggest ride sharing company you're possible you download the app for the biggest ride sharing company because it's where you're going to get the most cost that was my research on a reason why do you look at the financial who was a privately owned company with almost nothing publicly available the only thing I do about Uber was how much that is gross business leading in and how much money they lost and those were leaked by in a BC you know presentation somewhere what I'm trying to say is even if I had access to all of the financial removal what would I look small revenues big losses there's not much you learn about your companies by looking at their financials because it's all about the market they're serving the product they're offering over there so here's what I did after this research if you can call it that I have no picture and I try to do this with the and this is what I tried with the Silicon Valley Bank right and it's a good way of saying saying all these stories of Milling around I wouldn't make sense of what's going on here I drew a picture of what I've learned from my son my niece from talking to the Uber driver I've learned more about it by talking Uber drivers around the world I know they're all collectively probably hate you because when I get in the car because I get much more information from those drivers than I would ever get from the top executives so I drew a picture basically of how Uber made money they're an intermediary what made them special the networking benefits and essentially it became the platform that I used to wear so that's the first step is understand the business you're in because I'm going to tell a story for the company and remember you're trying to tell a business story not writing a creative novel so don't create characters because you think they're interesting you don't have any three-headed dogs God in entrances to to addicts or something this is something we're looking for so when you tell a business story my advice is first keep it simple here's what I don't want to see as your story I don't Game of Thrones right you know made seasons in 80 episodes you have like 15 minutes keep it focused be surprised how many startup stories I listened to but some it's usually in geek and come it's great amazing Africa how many downloads how do you plan to make money it looks at you like have two heads let me go back and tell you how interesting the app is at least have you thought about the possibility of making money keep it focused content and it's my job to ground you in reality so think of yourself as a Kevin O'Leary of the startup space we watched you know short time and your job is to ask the question that's nice but so there's my Uber store in June of 2013. and I'm making I never apologize to stories in hindsight because you look at sort of how unrealistic based on what I've used in 2013 here's the story at offrook I described it as an urban car service College already you can see in my story where do I see it succeeding in cities and houses and car service persons which would expand the business by bringing in new users like who like my sons so it is going to expand the business that you see out there but bringing users would not have been part of the car service business product remember car service has been around the business for 100 years right taxi cabs dominated but it's bringing users with local networking benefits already described what networking benefits are if Uber becomes the largest ride sharing company in New York there's going to be a Tipping Point where it ends up dominating the market say what's the local doing it well in my story Uber can take New York live can take Chicago dedicated Beijing different ride sharing company as opposed to a global networking benefit like Google and Facebook Highway was basically dominate the entire month so in my story you're going to have multiple right sharing companies in different parts of the world dominating different each region I did assume that it could keep doing what it's doing that 20 is completely arbitrary right that they keep I'm sure that you know perhaps Galactic was eating dinner in 2008 and somebody said what percentage of these spare these pairs we planted he's writing the tip out you know what 20 sounds good there's no good reason but once it said it sticks I'm going to assume that it's going to stay it's freaking and second that they're going to stay with their existing model not only the cars and not hiring the trash that's going to become the framework of my story so now comes the part where I think you need it's easy to tell big stories in fact it's easy to get carried away temporary so what I call the 3p test is it possible is it plausible is it a problem if you tell impossible stories you're telling me very good so first I want to make sure it's possible and lots of things are possible Right somebody's done something like this before is it plausible you need to show me something more then it can be done I'm sure it's worked in certain parts of the world and you're going to be and probably requires even more specificity I struggle with explaining the difference you know it sounds like a plan on what possible so I've addressed with lots of different ways of explaining I'll give you the one that I think thinks the best 2017 I was in a tour of Latin America talking about narrative announcements the stories too and uh it was a it was a it was hectic the first day I was in Sao Paulo Brazil the second day I was I was in San Diego Chile the third day I was in Lima Peru doing this in each group so it's very good what can I bring up before 300 Brazilians illustrate the difference between possible plausible and problems and I want to pick something where every person in the room would have a point of view so what do you think if you had 300 presidents in a room and you wanted to pick one top where you know every person in the room would have a strong point of view what does that means it was about six months before the World Cup I said is it possible that Brazil will win the World Cup you asked 300 Brazilians six months before a World Cup is it possible that preserving the World Cup what do you think the address of course it is we won it five times before I said okay it's implausible that president of the world but ask this question December of 2014 that room would have been a little shady so that we follow soccer there was a World Cup in 2014 and it happened to be in Brazil and there was a semi-final between Brazil and Germany that Brazilians have tried to erase right um what is the score again 8-2 7 Watson it was it was lacking for the ages but by 2017 they were feeling pretty good about themselves yeah it's plausible we've got a good people second ranked in the world we're moving up the rankings then I said is it problem and now you can see the course if Neymar says if he doesn't flip and flop do whatever Neymar does of the pitch and if this happens and this happened right now you can see with each one I'm raising the end and I think about it the same way when I hear a startup story I have to make sure it's possible then I've got to ask the right questions make sure to pass them and you can see that this is what separates bearing Tales From business stories so I'm going to leave you with some thoughts you can have impossible stories you'd be amazed at how many business stories are here right this is the story so I'm not even asking any questions this is a fairy tip stories like I can keep going at six percent a year forever okay thanks some point in time you're going to be the global economy then what right I did an entire piece on fairness opinions in m a built around now the Tesla Solar City merged where two investment banks have come in with their numbers and I essentially was very harsh and ever called for the valuation that they did uh Tesla because that was an exchange of the data value Tesla have you ever seen an offensive buildings these are public evaluation to say deal makes sense and that valuation have acquired estimated is six percent growth rate in Tesla in for maturity to justify the evaluation my first reaction is what currency you value Tesla Argentine pesos six percent growth rate that's an impossible evaluation our evaluation that claims that grow can come from being more efficient every year in perpetuity you can cause cause with your margin card exceed 100 and Beyond then what are you going to do so if possible evaluations are going to be easy to do when but when we come back on Wednesday I'm going to talk about implausible and improbable valuations and I want you when you tell the story for your company to be the hardest predict of your own story that you can be asked questions of yourself is this possible is this possible is this problem so if you started your valuation of pedestal done evaluation take a look at your story and probe for its weaker spots not because you want to take it apart but because this story is only as strong as a screen respect so Wednesday will come back and talk about the question can allow you to detect with us with this lecture 
over there thank you perfect foreign [Music] okay folks just a reminder if you want feedback on your valuation next Friday by five o'clock six o'clock somewhere around there get it to me by the end of next week um and try to stay with the fcff simple into a spreadsheet I used you're building your own I'm okay with it but if it's you know it needs more work for me because I have to check to make sure you're not subtracting something that should be added because the mechanics I have to make sure so it just makes my and if you want to adapt the fcff super do so you can add extra line items and revenues and extra expense items so think of it as an architecture that you could work with that's pretty pretty open to change So today we're going to continue on the storytelling part and I'm going to start with uh with the start of the class guys I'm going to start with something that I get pushed back on which is people are used to using Excel spreadsheets value companies you know and most people who do valuation that's what they do their argument is why are you wasting your time I don't have to tell a story I'm just going to send you an Excel spreadshe so let's say you're dealing with somebody like that and I'm the person I've sent you a spreadsheet no story I want you to reverse engineer I'm going to argue that every Excel spreadsheet the valuation is really telling a story and I wanted to try to reverse engineer what the story would have to be to justify the numbers in the sheet so guess what I'm doing I have a company where I projected a compounded annual growth rate in Revenue so 50 to here for the next 10 years that's it's a company you've never heard of the name is complete so you can't gauge it's abusive 50 compounded growth rate during that period I assumed that my target operating margin would rise to 20 which is twice the industry average that this company is able to do so with a very high sales recap operation which means they're very low reinvestment each year and finally I'm giving it a cost to Capital seven percent which is well below the industry average so all you see is a spreadsheet with numbers the questions about what has to be true about this company for this spreadsheet to actually make sense so go along with me first is the company of value is likely to be a is it a small company or a big company and what is it that that makes you believe it's a small company a 50 compounded annual growth rate every year for the next 10 years is going to take your revenues and increase them 25. if you have 10 billion in revenues that's going to be really difficult to do so it must be a small company because if I'm doing this in a large company I'm a very dangerous ground what am I telling you about the total Market is it um Stable Market or a growing Market and what what is what is the clue that makes you believe it's a growing up the fact that I'm able to grow it what am I able to do while I'm growing have higher margins right if it's a mature market now I want to go for this growth it's got to be gone from taking market share away from somebody else it's going to be very difficult to then argue I'm going to have twice the margin so that combination must mean that I'm talking about a total Market that's growing because that gives me some leeway am I telling you something about the competitive advantages that this company has the fact that I'm reinvesting very little and high margins must mean there's some barrier to enter something special about my company and am I telling anything about the capital intensity of this company's business model the fact that I'm low reinvestment because I found a way to actually grow without reading maybe I'm an Airbnb in a Hospitality business where everybody's out of town what I'm trying to tell you is when you have issues with somebody's valuation the questions you should ask should not be about the numbers because you're playing on their turf so if you say look you know 50 growth rate that looks High you're essentially on that Turf there is a word about 45 growth rate the question I'd ask is hey your revenue is already at 15 billion a 50 growth rate makes those revenues into 250 billion can this company pull it up every valuation tells a story most of the time the story is implicit even the person doing the spreadsheet is not a way they're telling the story and that's a very dangerous place to be so what I'm trying to get you to do on that this the valuation you're going to turn in next Friday is make your story explicit it's going to be there anyway I can probably reverse engineer your story from your numbers but why should we do that that should be something you do because in the process you might stop and say hey maybe that assumption was not such a great idea after all so the reason we tell stories is to kind of keep ourselves kind of in line with the facts in reality so let's say you turn in your valuation next Friday he the sigh of relief I'm done good things change between next Friday and May 8th which is the actual official date let's see what things can change there's probably going to be at least one more earnings report between now I know between and May could that change evaluation you might learn things in that earnings report that make you change your story second could macroeconomic changes that know what the fomc's come out with the decision yet or not but today there's going to be something for the federal for the Federal Reserve there's going to be banking changes regulations yeah macro changes can affect to different degrees right if you're if you're valuing a bank you're watching those macroeconomic changes very closely because they could have a direct consequence and how much you could pay out in dividends what kind of return Equity you can have what about regulatory changes now if you're a valley Google you're watching the California Supreme Court ruling on whether Uber drivers our employees or whether they're independent contractors it makes a difference in your business model because of your employees you got much higher costs you got to deal with it in the margins what if you're running Uber and Lyft comes out with a really bad earnings report he said what's that got to do with me that's left but when you have smart if you have 10 semiconductor companies so one comes another bad report you might have to reassess the stories for the other night because it's telling you something about the market which might affect your story I mean let me cut the long story short lots of things can change your story which means your valuation is constantly in motion hopefully it won't be Silicon Valley Bank speed of motion because then you can go from 100 billion to zero in two days which always going to be changing and that troubles people because somehow there's this notion that's been sold among intrinsic value pure is that intrinsic values timeless what absolute nonsense intrinsic value is at a point in time it can change the one thing I can say is intrinsic value will change less than price will check because price is going to react to whatever it is so value is going to be in motion it's going to change and that's always going to be the case final point if you remember I introduced this notion of a corporate life cycle right where companies go from Young startups babies toddlers to teenagers to mature companies to old age to death now every valuation is a bridge between stories numbers the stories and numbers I wanted to think about how that balance between which one you will use more will change as you go through the life cycle you know some will be well in very young companies what's driving evaluation it has to be mostly story right there's nothing there they're not in fact my over 2014 I had barely any numbers gross Billings and how much they lost and I didn't miss the fact that I didn't have financials you can get away with being an Excel ninja right you could take line items and project them out and probably get a fairly decent valuation you can be mostly numbers in fact yeah the way I think about this is you're running a young company it's like being in chapter two years so somebody starts a book and dies in the middle of the book you're called in to finish the rest of the book rewelling young startup the author died in chapter two you got 33 more chapters to go you got a lot of room to create new characters and change the story but the author dies in chapter 33 and you have to finish the last two chapters you don't have a whole lot of room to run your story matters more with young companies unless it never ceases to matter but less as companies mature so those are things I wanted to keep in mind because today we're going to wrap up the last sections of the storytelling but the last session I talked about impossible stories implausible stories and improbable stories they give examples in probably a possible stories a company that grows at six percent a year in dollar terms of an economy growing at two percent here a company that improves its its earnings it grows its earnings Everywhere by cutting costs forever okay implausible stories can happen but you better have a very good explanation for why that story holds and so if a company is much higher margin than the rest of the sector and I say hey what is it doing you better have a good explanation this company has special protections against competition this is why the margins are but I'm going to give you what I what is my favorite device when I look at evaluation to make a judgment on whether I should be asking tough questions call it evaluation drawing valuation triangle is three sides to it there's growth there's margins and there's reinvestment I'm going to give away what I'm going to do next Friday because next Friday at about five o'clock I'm dreading looking at that my perfect DCF folder I've created now remember that's a subject you have to use and I'm not doing it because I want to be picky but because I'm going to get with my undergraduate class which says 350 undergraduates at this class put together but 500 Excel spreadsheets are going to write around 5 PM much as I beg people send it on Tuesday or Wednesday Thursday most of it will arrive on Friday at 5 pm so I have 500 spreadsheets to go through and I have to assess valuations if you think that I'm going to look at your growth rate and say that 23 growth rate for Spotify should really be 21 you're assuming that I know things I really have no idea about it I don't know the growth rate for every company I'm not even close so here's what I'm going to do so let's say you turn in your valuation I'm going to look at your Revenue growth rate let's say it's a high number is it okay you're valuing a company you've used a high number I'll check your terminal your revenues to make sure it's not Netflix kind of high and I'll talk about what I mean by that in 600 billion revenues then maybe that's important so I'm going to check but let's say I get a high growth rate it's okay then I'm going to go check how much you're reinvesting and all I have to do to do that is look at the difference between an after tax operating income and your free cash flow to the firm right and if you're reinvesting a lot you're going to see a big difference and if I saw high growth what should I usually expect to see in the reinvestment section high or low I should say Hi and then when I look at your cost of capital let's say it's a US dollar based valuation I'll tell you what to do if it's a different currency remember I said the median cost to Capital global company at the start of 2023 was about nine percent if you had high growth and high reinvestment what should I expect to see as a cost of capital number higher than the nine percent or lower than the nine percent high growth High reinvestment usually higher risk right high high high you're going to get an email back from me saying I can't tell you where the evaluation is right but it's internally consistent low low low I'm going to get three minutes saying you have a very depressing view why do you pick this company but it is internally consistent but if you have high growth with low reinvestment and low cost to Capital I'm going to look at your story you know what I'm looking for tell me what makes this company the special company that can grow fast and you might say things like it is spent the last 20 years building capacity there's a lot of excess capacity that's why the reinvestment number is low going forward sales cap ratio is high and it produces something that's non-discretionary which must explain the low cost account basically whenever you have a mismatch I'm going to look at your story much more closely when you have a match I'm going to just say this is an upbeat story a downbeat story but internally it's consistent but it probably basically takes your valuation through that triangle and say does this valuation make sense so I'm going to go back to my Uber evaluation in June of 2014. I wanted to make sure I wasn't telling a fairy tale but what was my story there was an urban car service company that attracts new users into the business and as local networking benefits right now you know what that's an easy story depend because by June of 2014 Uber was doing all of those things and I could point to a part of the word where actually they'd been around for five years and that actually changed the way people were using cars into the Bay Area right sharing a deeper root said started earlier and by 2014 they doubled the size of the car service business in the Bay Area people were using car service for things they didn't even think about so because my story was essentially not that ambitious the defense I have to play is actually much easier because I can say look they're already doing it they're an urban car service company they're attracting new users like look at the Bay Area and they have local networking benefits look how quickly they grow could I tell the biggest story for Uber June in 2014. record more ambitious story and I could have called him a transportation company nothing wrong with that in fact if you're a Founder what are you told to do tell the biggest story you can but it comes to the downside the bigger your story becomes the more your defense has to be strengthened because now I'm going to ask you about hey you're you're telling me about things the company has never done how is it going to pull it off so if you're starting for Tesla is about electric cars it's a much more defensible story than a story about Tesla as a robot company or is it or an AI company or as an automated driving company because they're I'm not saying it's impossible do you have to now do the hot I should be doing that work for you it's not my job if your teller is telling me the valuation say hey you know what you know let me justify that for you you have to come up with a story that perhaps once in a while and I wouldn't think like an investor you will hear a story and you really want the story to be true you know what happens when you really want a story to be true you stop asking questions I call these runaway stories let me explain what a runaway the what the ingredients were runaway Story on first there's usually a charismatic likable storyteller second they're telling a story about disrupting a business you've never quite liked you want that business to get ruined and third they also talk about changing the world and making it a better place along the way come to abstract so let me give you a story and you tell me what they want the story to be true it's about a 19 year old who drops out of Stanford who does that what's the admissions rate at Stanford unless you're a synchronized swimmer or something get it through the side door it's like minus three percent she gets in and drops out as a June this is a soft model at 19. to start a new business and not that technique starting another software business here's what makes the story different it's not a he it's a sheet usually it's some software engineer dropping out it's a she she's going to draw a part and she's going to start a blood testing business you guys have experience with blood tests I hate Quest Labs with that passion because you know how it works right you got to make a blood test you call them they don't even have you know 20th century or 20 forget about 21st century 20th century technology you call them and after about the fifth call finally they pick up and they say I have to make a blood test appointment they say we have one open and in two and a half years so I need to get it quickly oh well in about two months we have a six a.m appointment think about it say okay I'll take it you'll get up at 4 AM you get there at 6 a.m and they make you wait till nine why because they can find at 9am the door opens and the nurse comes out she looks like nurse ratchet from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest says come on in you go in there two buckets next to her so what are those for your blood what do you need two buckets of my blood just in case Dracula shows up I guess it extracts half your blood puts it in the bucket and they make you crawl back into your car you go home you don't hear back from the lab three weeks four weeks you called the lab and said it came for a blood test what are my results We Can't Tell You Why privacy laws it's my blood we sent it to your doctor so now you go through the whole exercise again you call your doctor we have an opening you know three months from now six a.m you know show up at the doctor's office wait till 9 A.M you go in and the doctor looks at it and looks very serious and finally says there's nothing wrong with you you go home but don't let down to quit dignity arriving in the mail about a week or two later which is a bill for two thousand dollars to take two buckets of your blood to feed Dracula and tell you nothing's wrong with you don't you want this business to be disrupted that's what this 19 year old is going to do she's going to create a blood testing business which takes two drops of your blood not two buckets in a nanotainer that sounds so much more scientific than a bucket she's going to test them for 32 different things you haven't even heard of 30 of them but 32 is better than 30 better than 25 and she's going to send you the results by email it's almost like it's in the 21st century 45 minutes later it's going to cost you only fifty dollars and by the way she's going to get these tests away to people parts of the world who can't afford blood tests because she really wants to save the world come on don't you want the story if you're making a movie this would be a great movie right did I make up this story not really because this is the true story of Elizabeth House 19 year old drops out a stand so it starts a company called theranos does exactly what I described and becomes incredibly successful because by the middle of 2015 theranos was price I shouldn't have used the word value at about 9 billion and it wasn't just VC some of the biggest VC names are on that list but wasn't just VCS the Cleveland Clinic no one of America's Premier Healthcare entities had said you know this looks very promising we like this there are no steps Walgreens said they want to have a theranos lab in every Walgreens in the middle of 2015 if you'd ask me what do you think about thermos that I said I don't know much about the company but given the lineup here VCS you got Cleveland Clinic you got Walgreens must be something special going on it's back up though if you're investing in a blood testing company what might be one of the first questions you would ask and like answered before you start to throw hundreds of millions it's not a social media company or it's a blood testing company right what's the question you'd ask does your blood test work I thought somebody would have asked that question before pushing up the price nine billion but I was wrong because in October of 2015 a Wall Street Journal reporter decides to ask that question and the results are actually in the public domain because you've got to get blood disapproved so you went to the FDA and says therano's been approved for these 32 tests they said not really they said what does not really mean there's been a proof of one of the tests I think it was herpes the herpes there but the remaining 31 we haven't approved the test he said why the results are a little noisy you're in a noisy blood test looks like trust me you don't want one you go to the doctor they do a test the results come back and it says you could be dying or you might not be don't worry about it go home noisy is not a speech he went Precision in the blood test right if you have blood sugar that's how you don't say blood sugar might be high it might not be high we can't quite tell initially of course when this article came out in the Wall Street Journal there are no threateness they said you know you have no idea what you're doing but over the next six months the entire company unraveled six months later you know what that that number looks like it was down to zero Elizabeth Holmes had been Bland banned from the blood testing business and she actually moved to San Diego I ran into her once in a while you know and she of course recently was found guilty in a court of lawsuit you know she's waiting to go to prison it's an appearance process going on but in October of 2015 when that Wall Street Journal article came out I wrote a piece in my blog because in hindsight everybody said it's stupid enough to do it but in October 2015 I wrote a post about you know in hindsight we all see it stupid but let's say it's June of 2015. Elizabeth Holmes actually was in New York City giving a talk and at that time she was one of the most celebrated young business women in the world she was not a social media she was actually I think one of the first women billionaires under the age of 30 who did not make get get there through you know being a social influencer so there's there's a big deal the people who bring their daughters to work to say I said let's say June of 2015 you'd gone to that thousand person meeting in New York City and this celebrated entrepreneur gets on there and she talks about how she's going to save the world with this blood test would you have had the courage to stand up and ask the question does your blood test work you look felt like the guy who killed bambly's mother right I've always prepared for that guy now you know if you've ever seen bad Beast right at the start of the movie Bambi's mother gets shot falls to the ground you never see the hunter other than this silhouette that guy must have gone through trauma he made a movie about it or Dior has grow up you know as an orphan but it's easy in hindsight to say I would have done it but we have these stories take off and become these runaway stories it's very difficult to ask questions because everybody in the room so wants the story to be true that nobody it's like the other The Emperor's New Clothes nobody wants to ask the question because of what it might expose now one of the final question I asked was no there's a board of directors even though it's a private company why weren't they asking the question so I took a look at the board and it's right there my first reaction was put together this spot I mean if you're putting together a board that will never ask you questions I mean take a look at the board there's George schutz 94. Henry Kissinger Knight what the heck is a Henry Kissinger doing on a blood test anymore sitting there saying let's talk about the Iron Curtain whatever you know but but the cynical part of me said look if you're a CEO and you want to put together a board that will never ask you any questions here's my suggestion get together a bunch of 80 to 90 year olds put them on your board call a board meeting put a pillow in front of each seat just in case they have to take a nap have a backup ambulance you never know what can happen you're never going to get questioned but runaway stories take up and every few years you see one of these companies take off and you say why aren't people asking questions the answer is everybody in that ecosystem so wants a story to be true I'd have said the same thing about wework and it's very clever the fact that this was probably the first company that grew out of a TED talk right do you know that we were grew out of a TED Talk that Adam Newman gave about the importance of being a weed the irony the most narcissistic person on the face of the Earth talking about the how critical it was that we thought about the Consciousness away but I'm convinced that the reason Master son could spend for you know the amount of money that he spent was because people stopped asking questions eventually does the truth come out of course you know what causes a story to undrive it right it's built around a charismatic Storyteller what causes charismatic storytellers to eventually fall off the pedestal you start to realize hey they're lying about this how come this is how televangelists you know they got to the top and then next thing you know they're having an affair and decide the whole thing comes and wrap this is how stories unravel that Storyteller all of a sudden you start to say maybe he or she is lined and then you start digging and you recognize the story they're telling is that war with the number they talk about 32 tests but they're approved for only one and then the whole thing comes tumbling down yeah [Music] sure a company that they require High reward and so you can't but but can't you have high reward and ask questions at the same time that's already it right of course and that's exactly why you need to ask the questions it's high risk and if you want higher reward you want to make sure the risk you're taking is in a business with a basis that's where we ask questions not to stop the idea but to make sure that there is a business behind the idea and that's why this is so unhealthy is you're letting something get way too big without testing the basic premise of I mean we work with a horrifically bad business what especially the aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank you should see exactly what wework was doing that made them such a horrifically bad business but so we work business they go to the middle of a city usually the most expensive part they will lease or buy a building for the next 30 or 40 years and then what did they do sublease it out for three months or six months you can come in and get an office horrifically bad nobody in real estate would would have done this would have survived why because you're always one recession away from going bankrupt right you have a recession everybody leaves your offices your building is now empty but you still have to make the lease payments and I remember when when the wework IPO came out I looked through this was a 350 page prospectus I was looking for is there something they've done that's magical that fixes it miss my 350 Pages later nothing that's what I wrote the post saying there's something wrong here this is the basic problem in the company if you're not talking about it how come nobody's asking questions and of course six weeks later eight weeks later the value dropped to zero so let's stay on this concept of impossible implausible Improv sometimes you can be in a cluster of people all of whom think they're being rational but if you look at a bunch of clusters of people Each of which think they're rational collectively that's a problem let me explain let's suppose you see a big Mark right now what's what's everybody talking about AI maybe the cloud business let's take AI right big business so you are a software engineer you have to experience the area you think you can build an AI business you're an entrepreneur let me pause right there when you think about entrepreneurs collectively as a as a group do they tend to be diffident careful people or do they tend to be overconfident um kind of risk-taking people it's almost by definition have to be overconfident risk-taking so you're an overconfident risk-taking person so you look at that big monster I can conquer the market I'm going to start a company she started you see card magic happens let me ask you the same question about Venture capitalists dividend careful people or overconfident risk nature of the market is you self-select the kind of people who become veggie capitalism not the people in your high school class who've never spoke up or they were the people who basically tried to take over the conversation there's there's an end game so you have an overconfident entrepreneur surrounded by overconfident Venture capitalists all of whom this could think that they have the business that's going to conquer the big Market do you think there aren't other clusters like this all over Silicon Valley so while you're starting this business there are a hundred other groups of people Each of which has an overconfident entrepreneur with over content and BCS who pick that entrepreneur each of whom thinks that they can conquer the market you think so what what does overconfidence mean when you project out your revenues and your margins you're going to project that you high enough but because you think you are much smarter than everybody else and if you think about this happening at a hundred different places collectively you see what's going to happen right the collective valuation across a hundred companies is going to be too high not that every company in this group is bad is a Bad Company some of them are going to be Supreme winners but a lot of them are going to fall to the waistline this is human nature as long as you've had big businesses this has been going on the 1990 in the 1980s with PC business I remember everybody wanted to start a PC company they saw the growth coming hundreds of PC companies and by the time you looked at them in 1990 maybe four or five succeeded the respite to the side because and collectively the the value is too hot 91. then you go to the.com business same phenomenon everybody Russian every time there's a big Market this phenomenon I call it the big Market delusion in fact before AI it's electric cars right Lucid driven into every company this is going after a big Market therefore we'll give it a bit back I actually tested this with your online advertising Market about seven years ago at the peak of its Glory Facebook and Google were doing incredibly well snap but just gone public and every one of them you know we asked the justification why are we paying this number it's because the online advertising Market is huge and we'll get a piece so here's what I did I took the market cap of every publicly traded company that made its money from online advertising and I'd reverse engineered from the market cap what the revenues would have to be in year 10 to justify them you can actually do this with your own valuations use the solver function in Excel you can solve for what the revenue should have to be in your tend to get the market price today that's basically what I did with each company and then I added up all of those implied revenues so this is in 2015 I was projecting the revenues in 2025 based on what the market cap is you add up that last column you come up with the total value of five I'm sorry breaking revenues of of 682 billion So based on how these companies were being priced the revenues 10 years from now at every 682. you think so what the entire the advertising Market in 2015 was 500 billion dollars you see when it can grow okay it can grow but then online advertising would have to become a hundred percent of all advertising and you'd still have trouble getting to 682 billion collectively the revenues are projecting are just way too high given the size of the market and I'll wait for the same thing was true at the peak of the electric car mania when brilliant and Lucid you took their market caps and you reverse engineered how many cars they would have to sell to justify the market cap 180 million cars and the problem is in a typical year about 80 to 85 million cars get sold that's the big Market dimension it's not that individual groups think that so if you take each individual groups are you guys being rational these are all who have been completely rashed but that's the nature of overconfidence right this and this is how you create bubbles and eventually the bubble Bush and of course after the bubble bus everybody Rings their hands and what do they say oh never again never again it's such a terrible experience in fact I wrote a piece that still gets me backlash I said what's wrong with bones he said what do you mean what's wrong with bubbles they burst and people are hurt I said would you want to live in a world run by actuaries you know what the world would look like we'd still be in caves they're actually saying this fire thing it's too dangerous we'll have to test it a few thousand more years and then we can leave the caves every human advance in history has come from people overreaching the.com bubble that person to change the way we live when was the last time we went into a travel agent's office mostly we probably wouldn't you know what the heck is that I remember when I asked to make a plane trip reservation I had to walk into this office sit across this desk from this all-knowing person with the only terminal on the face of the Earth that I want to get from New York to Chicago and they'd look at that I can get you a flight in two weeks so thank you so much without you I would never leave the house we changed the way we we Act Right social media no matter what you like or dislike it just change the way we get our information AI will it take absolutely Chaturbate is already changing the way in which classes are being taught and you know how you know how people are writing stuff I'm not saying that these big markets don't change but I'm saying but these big markets to create change unique people to overreach bubbles are a feature not a bug in the system I remember the conversation with uh with with a person who's in charge of Singapore's Financial market and Singapore is one of the few governments that thinks 40 years ahead so Singapore you know so he calls me and he says you know what our markets are not that there's not much trading going on there's not much activity we'd like more activity on Market more people trading in our in in this and I said okay and I said but if you do that you have to be willing to accept the fact that it's going to come and follow it dirty and overreaching and Bubbles and he said no no we don't like that in Singapore I said that's a problem if you take markets they're going to come with three steps forward two steps back that's the nature of markets and that's what the big Market delusion does it kind of pushes towards this problem is being formed and correct you could take the Excel spreadsheet you have right you get a value per share that's different from the price per share all right so set the value equal to the price and solve for what the revenue growth would have to be to justify so basically used to solve the function itself and you solving sort of the market cap of the company is equal to the value that you get so it'll spin through and he said revenues have to be this and I did this with every company using exactly the spreadsheet you have so it's actually a very simple exercise in any excess solving for any one variable that you want to back up one final example before we leave this space no I I'm not a not much of a consumer recorded research reports other than for laughs and um now I've been writing Tesla for a while and equity research in Tesla has always been abysma it chases the practice of beloved by recommendation the price gets to 1200 your Excel recommendation once it drops back to 150 and this is about 10 years when Tesla was a tiny company how tiny was selling 24 000 cars a year so I did a valuation of Tesla and I've tried to always be in the middle in Tesla right neither in a Tesla enthusiasm or a Tesla hater and I came up with the belly I don't remember what it was 150 per share at that time and there was this equity research report I saw from a very well-known equity research address I wouldn't name his name but he's been following Tesla for a while you'd see his name every time that's like it's important and he has put out an equity research report the big buy and a value per share of 600 per share curious what does he see in Tesla that I don't so I pick up the equity research report it's 250 pages long like reading a creative novel lots of pictures lots of graphs and you know what the point was and then on page 57 There's A D dot C dot f i mean that's a terminology There's A D dot C dot alphabet so I open up the D dot C dot f to see what dncfe is using that gives him a higher value so I start with revenues maybe he's projecting our far more revenues than I am that explains and it turned out he was actually projecting lower revenues than ours but maybe he's marching so much higher and he's giving them tech company margins so I looked at his epidural margins and margins are actually roughly in line with my March now I'm befuddled revenues are below mining margins similar to mine so where is all this extra value coming from so I keep going and remember the little trick I said to compute how much is being reinvested take the earnings and compare to the free cash for the firm I did that over the next 15 years I ended up the earnings from the free cash flow that difference is what is collectively being reinvested over the next 15 years and I found it was reinvesting almost nothing that explained the extra 450 dollars for sure how many cars is Tesla selling 24 000 it is how many cars is he projecting Tesla will sell 1.137 million possible Right 86 million cars it's you know 1.1 million cars is not bad but there's one problem in 2013 Tesla had one plant in Fremont with the capacity on a really good day of about 200 000 cars you see what the promise what's the extra 900 000 cars going to come from so call the equity researcher he was in an airport on his way to California maybe to worship at a Tesla Shrine I know where he was going and as I said you know look I've been looking at your D dot C dot f I decided to stay with this terminologist in case it would be confused and I have some questions he said I can't answer your questions and said why not he said because I don't do the number crunching I have a team that does this and I said you have an entire team churning out this time of d dot C dot if it's a team of six okay I'll call you next week it's a week later and he said before he hangs up he says you're not going to write about this on your blog or anything right I said not for the next week but then all bets are off next week I'll call the entire team in schedule so lead analyst comes on and he says you know and I said what do you do you don't do anything he says I talk to me he said I'm a big smoother I smooth okay so who the second in command comes on so what do you do he says I am I'm the secondary schmoozer I go with them and the third guy comes on he says I'm the backup smoother one of these two guys I said who in this group does something other than schmooz they pointed this 23 year old they hired at rewarding last year he's the guy they put him in front of the uh on the phone and I really it's sorry I was a smart kid I lead him through and he very quickly gets I said what happened he said it slipped my mind so what slipped your mind Cat-Back stuff yeah because he said this is what I did I took last year's numbers and last year Tesla had capex very close to depreciation I just grew things out straining the street the way you taught to do excel straight you take each line either and because your base your very little reinvestment he basically built that in for the next 15 years I said do you think you have a problem he said yes but I think he said I don't see how we go public with this it doesn't look good if it says you're going to come out and say it slipped our mind to include capex in the cash flows so I gave him a suggestion that he did not take if any of you watch Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory the old version the Gene Wilder version not the Johnny Depp Abomination and this is my five-year-old grandson's favorite movie right now I watched it on the flight with him because I was in Florida we went to Disney World Together so you know if you've ever seen the movie one of the things that I remember about the movie and I saw it when I was much much younger one of the things I struggled with was this movie Willy Wonka chocolates are in every store but there's only one Factory it's a very inefficiently laid out Factory with like chocolate Rivers running through it not exactly what Henry Ford would require in an assembly line I always wondered how the heck does this one Factory churn out enough chocolates to get into all these stores and the answer is actually in the movie there's these mystical or magical creatures called Oompa Loompas go on Google and type in the word Oompa Loompa you'll see them they dance and they sing and while they dance think chocolates come flying out and I said here's what you need to do put out a press release the Tesla has fired all of its Fremont employees and replaced them with um Your Capacity problem is gone 200 000 cars who cares they can generate 1.1 million cars from that same Factory he didn't take my advice but we should create a new class of valuations called Oompa Loompa you preferred Willy wonkitis valuations where you see big growth numbers and nothing being reinvested to create that growth it's not magical you can't produce stuff without putting money back it's actually fun when you start looking at DCFS and you start breaking them about how many internal inconsistencies people build in Anatomy return to my Uber story Uber Urban Car Service Company attracts new users has local networking benefits it's going to continue to keep doing what they're doing 20 share for pretty much being an intermediary and they don't own the cars they don't hire the drivers I'm going to convert that story each part of it into a number urban car service company you know they played out the total Market I went after was the urban car service Market I went into Google search and said size of the urban car service Market I'm very sophisticated the way I look just being facetious nothing shows up you know what because in 2013 who dominated the urban car service Market taxi cabs across the world all splintered privately owned it's different in automobiles right automobiles much easier most of them are publicly traded you can take the revenues of companies add them up so I had to do this actually took me the most time in building up the stories I actually had to do the legwork to come up with the total urban car service market and here's what I did every city has an equivalent of a taxi and limousine commission New York City is called the plc they keep they regulate the tax in limousine business but they also have statistics so every year the tax and Limousine Commission tells you how much revenues taxi cab made New York so I did that in New York so this was available for about 50 cities I was able to get this number I added those numbers up I came up with 50 billion and then I doubled it why there's all those other cities and dogs I can't even get the number I doubled it I came up with 100 pennies remarkably precise right but to show you how these numbers percolate their way back into the public domain as facts I put the 100 billion as my total Market a year later I went back and said maybe there's a better estimate let me try Google search again size of the urban car service Mark guess what shows up with the number one search result 100 billion dollars estimated by the modern If Only They knew if only they knew how much fuss there is in this number they wouldn't say that well I'm trying to say is you will find a lot of total Market sizes on Google and a lot of them are like that hundred billion but the market I went after was 100 billion that market had been growing at about one and a half percent a year in the previous five years I made the growth rate six percent what does that bring in new users right the people like my son and my niece with so I brought in the urban car service I brought in the new users this is the total Market I have to decide what market share what did I describe as uh is Uber local networking benefits right which meant that you could have a dozen different ride sharing companies in different parts of the world dominating each part so you know what that effectively translates into nobody's going to have a 50 market share of the total Market I gave Uber a 10 market share huge by car service standards 2013 but I kept it 10. so let's say Uber gets kept state they're a mature company every Fair they're going to keep 20 that's going to be an incredibly profitable business it's a pure intermediate business I gave them an operating margin of 40 percent a lot of growth though but because they don't own the cars and they don't hire the drivers I gave them a sales to Capital ratio of five dollars of revenues for every dollar cap just to give you a sense of perspective that number on average across all U.S companies is closer to two I gave them five they don't run the cars they don't hire the drivers that gives me my cash flows what do I need to finish my discounted cash flow valuation I need a discount rate right and how you know we spent what eight sessions on betas risk free rates risk premium ignored all eight sessions the heck am I doing this to me to begin with you think this valuation is going to be made or broken by what my cost of capital is zero checks this is not even in my top 10 list of words my total Market itself is such a fuzzy number what the heck am I doing getting the cost to Capital the second decimal point so here's what I did I compute the cost to Capital every publicly traded company to start up every year so this year if you go to my my blog I have the histogram 10 dial 20 and 30th so basically all 45 000 companies I had that in 2014. I went to the 90th percentile what am I saying hey Uber is a risky company risky companies have cost a capital of twelve percent I use that as my cost account is there a chance Google might not make it remember in 2014 it was a small money losing company threatened by regulations and cities coming after that yeah but I gave it only a 10 chance of failure you know why this Venture capitals are priced at 17 billion in a sense it's too large to Fair remember when enter capitalists write things down they have to show it in their portfolio so they'll Supply Capital to the company to keep it going until it gets to its absolute last legs every part of my story has become a number that's the Craft part of valuation so when you do your assumptions I want you to think about connecting stories numbers because ultimately once I get those inputs evaluation kind of fall if this looks like a spreadsheet but every number in this spreadsheet if you ask me why is that number what it is I'm going to tell you a story why my revenue is 3.6 billion in year 10 because Uber is an urban car service company which attracts new people in the business local networking benefits why am I margin so high because they're an intermediary why am I reinvesting so little because they don't own the cars why is my cost of capital so high because they're a risky company nowhere in there did you see me you have no say the beta is 1.8 this is kind of a distraction every number ever in this valuation has a story behind it with my story and my numbers and I want to emphasize the word my here and you're going to see in a minute why I use that the value that I got push for the company was six billion dollars do you remember the original Wall Street Journal story that Ruby Doomer that Venture capitalism put three billion dollars into the company and priced it at 17 billion right I finished this valuation on June 8th of 2014. I think it was a Friday I posted it at 3 15 in the afternoon and 15 minutes later I get a call from a Wall Street Journal reporter she must be just waiting for the post to come out she right now gets on she says I noticed you just put out a blog post number I said thank you for notes she said also notice you vary the company in six billions and you're very observant she said you do know that Venture capitalism valued the company at 17 billion I almost corrected her there you know what I'd have directed or not right I said yes I do know their their price the company in seven people so how do you explain the 17 billion I said I don't have to I didn't pay it I've never felt the urge to explain what other people pay you know how much frustration this creates when you're trying to explain what other people do just let it go it's not your money somebody wants to pay fifty thousand dollars for Bitcoin what business is it of yours to get and say you know what that's too much to pay that rules and their money be parted the sooner the better it's not your job to step into you shouldn't be doing that that's so bad it's not my best you said are you telling me they're wrong I said I'm telling you nothing I'm sorry I'm saying with my story and my valuation I would not buy Uber but maybe they have a much bigger story that justifies it and that's the way I think about investing you're going to come up with a value for your company but it's not the value it's your value it's going to drive your decision and that's exactly the way investing should be I think the mistake we're making investing is we Outsource our decision making why do you buy a company because Jim Cramer told me to do so now stop complaining that he asked you to buy no he asked did ask you to buy Silicon Valley back at First Republic but maybe when he says buy you should just sell short and maybe the whole thing will work out but the fact that you turn over your decision making essentially means you're at the mercy of other people's decisions and this isn't rocket science you can't hide behind oh this is comp there's nothing we've done is something that you can't pick up with basic I mean you could probably compress this whole class every three hours and learn enough valuation to be able to at least do this Excel valuations on on side of you or to show the tan and have a lot of people to get it you know where I do it remember the story sheet that you see in fcff did you that was born out of my Uber valuation I created that story sheet because once I finish an Excel spreadsheet all the numbers get transported into story sheet and they're blank rows next so it says Revenue growth and take your number put it there and put a blank Road next to it so basically that's where you that way rather than tell a story that's disconnected your story is very focused to individual inputs in this part of my story explains my Revenue growth so it kind of creates discipline storytelling because I've discovered if you don't do that you get three page stories and you read the three page sorry what does that even mean so this makes you think about your story in connection with the numbers you're using and that's you know that's part of the reason it's built in and and as you do your Excel spreadsheet after you've done your evaluation go to the story sheet and fill in the story and as you do it don't be surprised if as you do the story and say well no I don't feel that comfortable now with that 15 margin that I use I'm going to go back and change the number so there's a feedback loop left speaking of feedback loops I've finished the zoom evaluation and I posted it it gets picked up in multiple places and this is the final step in valuation I call it keeping the feedback loop open remember I said this is my story and my evaluation I'm not a ride sharing specialist I don't know much about this business in fact I could say this about pretty much any company I've had I don't know much about infrastructure companies but that doesn't stop me valuing a time I don't know much about the electric car business but that doesn't stop me from running tests or another way of saying this there are people out there know far more about electric cars and the technology than I ever keeping the feedback loop open basically means listening to people tell you hey you know what that doesn't make sense in the case of the Uber valuation I got incredibly lucky I did my Uber evaluation got picked up in three different places actually four different places the first was a site called 538.com have you heard of this snake Silverside Nate silver used to work for the New York Times he created so it's I think now owned by ABC yeah so it's like it's for statistics schemes basically you districts to explain things like the hot headed basketball you've heard of this you know you start shooting you have a hot hand you should keep shooting so you take something like that is that true so editor 538.com after I post my blog calls me and he says you know what uh readers will be very be interested in something like this because they're statisticals and their little numbers get this I said sure okay so five they take the entire polls with the numbers here the second place I got a call from was a site called ports you've all heard of fox who reads Forks 75 year olds with flip phones I think kind of an aging value investing population they said we'd like to run this because our readers are convinces Tech things all overrated and it's all he said go ahead run it same post gets carried that the third place it got carried was a site called TechCrunch what a TechCrunch it's a digital magazine but silicon bag basically it's for techniques they said our readers will be interested in this overall some of them work it over so go ahead and the fourth place it got cared was the site called The Ride sharing guy it's still around it's actually a site for Uber and Lyft drivers you know three million of those people now around the world so it's a big population and the person who runs the site said I'd love to carry this because our our drivers are very interested in what the company is actually for sale post carried in four different places and I'm glad it got picked up because I get very different kinds of feedback from each one on the 538 side here's the kind of question to ask there I get asked I noticed Houston 12 costly Capital but I looked at your histogram and the 90th percentile is 11.97 percent how come you're using 12 percent so what numbers students get caught up on second decimal points and I said why don't you try 11.97 as a costume and see what happens five minutes later I get an email but nothing happened I can see what you did you just rounded up so not much to be learned there the Forbes said they loved it they said this is the way those tech people should be valuing companies I spent no time on that side nothing learned by people patting in the back saying how amazing it is the TechCrunch people absolutely despised it their reaction was how dare you value one of ours with your D dot C dot f we don't do that it's Silicon Valley so half the comments I think there were 400 comments in the tech crunch you know version of my post half of them were insults most of which I didn't even understand one called me you DCF guy what does that even mean good thing bad thing um but after you went through the pure insults you got things like you know let me tell you how Uber uses data and where the networking benefit comes from and I learned a great deal about the ride sharing business once I was willing to get past the you idiot you New Yorker you DCF guy Etc then you keep reading it's called keeping the feedback loop book and on the right sharing guys side I learned some of the most interesting things about Uber that I would never have known by talking robust management remember that 20 share that I said Uber Capital that's what they told their investors we keep twenty percent I got an Uber driver from LA who said you know what that's what they tell investors but let me explain to you what's happening in La I used to drive for Lyft Uber paid me three thousand dollars to switch now Lyft is offering me five thousand dollars to switch back I feel like a free agent without a contract he said by the time they do all of this stuff I'd be surprised if they kept more than seven or eight percent of the fat five years later Uber leaks out that they actually keep 7.7 percent affair they called it a contribution margin and my reaction was I learned that five years ago by talking an Uber driver in L.A so but a week later I'm on a trip to Munich and I'm waiting for my flight is delayed and I check my emails and I get an email from a gentleman called Bill GERD bill is a partner at Benchmark Capital leaves one of the leading bench Academy in fact he used to be actually at um at Credit Suisse first Boston is an equity research analyst in the 90s so he actually knows the valuation steps perhaps one of the few VCS who understands valuation and an email from him and he was as partner Benchmark Capital Benchmark was one of the First Investors to know but they invested Uber as a billion dollar company and he was in the board of directors for Uber and he was rumored to be the person closest to Travis Galactic was the CEO of uber he asked an easy question does Bill Gurley know more about Uber than I do of course to open up the email and here's how it begins I just read your Uber post and looked at your Uber valuation and I did not like it okay we got that out of the way he said I've written my own blog post to counter your blog posts blog post to blog post Warfare very 21st century and he said I've said some mean things about you and I just wanted to let you know sincerely yeah closely man at two hours of my flight guess where I go next I go to the site called above the crowd that's Bill's log and there's a lead article it's still out there you can find it on Google the modern misses buy a mark get it no word driving message by my my GPS is not working any basically took issue with every part of my story he said Uber is not a Car Service Company it's a logistics company notice how words have consequences what can logistics companies do they can do car service they can do delivery they can do moving he said it's not just Urban it's going to be everywhere it gave examples of suburban and Rural services that Uber was going to be having and he said we're also looking for ways to connect with the airlines so when you book your flight on United after they've promised you not to drag you out of the plate to Seoul and you landed Seoul you can you can reserve your rule but while you're making you see what you say he didn't use the word but basically it's talking the way of taking Uber's dominance in New York and making it glow that's fascinating there are insults along the way which is obviously the modern has never driven an Uber of course I have it you know same thing people said the modern never owned it I own a Honda Civic 2010 Honda Civic it's more than enough for me yeah so I finished up 15 minutes later I emailed him back still sitting in Munich Airport I said I just read your story remember it's fascinating do you want me to put a number on your story he said what are you talking about I set up Excel spreadsheet open here you've told me a big story I can convert that story numbers he said be my guest so here's what I did where am I going now remember in my story at 100 billion dollar market size the logistics Market is three times as big so I made it 300. remember my story Captain market share 10 local networking benefit the city of global networking story 40 markets there we only three or four ride sharing companies in the world would those two changes put in take a look at what my value is so there's my value with my story there's bill gurley's story with a much bigger market and a global market Global networking than it's 15. 53 billion so I sent this back to Bill still sitting in Munich Airport this flight is taking forever to board and I said do you like this Mark I said a lot and he said oh by the way that 20 share oh that's probably not long for the world it's more like 10 I almost told them that Uber driver in La already told me that but it's one story right in the other clearly they're both plausible stories right and in fact in December of 2014 I actually wrote a third I actually you know Uber for like five posts that year right and my last person in December of 2014 I said you know what I got sick and tired of people bitching and mourning that they did not like my story I said My Story it's my money I'll tell whatever story I want but I'll give you the capacity to tell your story so I did it and created a do it yourself but which is what I've done with Tesla and other companies but I said you pick your own story stop bitching and mourning about my story is Uber A Car Service Company logistics company Transportation Company or is it you know some kind of on-demand company what's an on-demand company whatever you want they will deliver it you want to go to the bathroom you're too lazy to get on the bed carrier the bathroom charge you a fee right the closest I've seen to an on-demand company is a company called go check it's a Indonesian I won't even call it a Car Service Company go check basically let's say an Avengers movie is opening tomorrow and the lines are going to be three hours but you don't have the time to do it go check will hire somebody to stand in line for you this is a great service if you think about it right you know because there's a difference in how much people value their time so I said you picked what Market there and you pick whether they have local networking benefits no networking benefits of global networking benefits you tell me whether they have strong barriers to entry no barriers to entry you pick whether employees uh the driver you know drivers or employees and at the end of the process given their choices I said this is what your value movers could be and guess what based on the stories the value for Uber can be less than a billion or over 90 billion depending on not all of these stories are equally Plus but what I'm saying is when you have young companies you will have disagreed why because you're in chapter two of the book you say what will chapter 35 look like who knows what Divergent pads you can do to get there so you finish your story you feel pretty comfortable with your story you make a decision let me sit back saying I'm done well remember stories can change stories can shift and stories can sometimes break this Silicon Valley story break last week absolutely breaking the story basically means you're done with young with young Pharma companies what caused the breakers an FDA test that basically goes bad the whole company can go from 10 billion to nothing I remember in Ashley Madison have you heard of them these ones this was this dating site in in the UK they had a data basically the data got out this is you know these are married people dating other married people they don't want the dated overnight the value of the company went from like almost a billion down to 200 million because you can't protect your data nobody's going to be on your side story breaks out with you but something happens and you say you know what the story is done luckily that doesn't happen very often but when it does happen your value can essentially go to zero or drop substantially your stories can sometimes which basically with your basic story stays the same but the Contours of the story can become different your Revenue growth can get a little higher if you March and can get a little lower higher I've told the same story for Apple from 2012 to 2021 the story was of a cash machine that got much of its value from one one product which is what is that much of Athens while you come from the iPhone it's not it's not a computer car but it's a SmartPhone company and because the smartphone business was leveling off pretty much everybody wants a smartphone pretty much has one now it's going to be a more mature business so it's a slow growth cash machine and it's only in the last two years that I've created a second leg of this app but Services business adding on that I told them but once in a while you might get a narrative change when you look at a company and it doesn't I never thought it would do it but Tesla for instance people keep talking about the robot business or their their the energy business or the automated driving business there's nothing that I see in Tesla right now that would lead me to believe that there's enough value in that business to significantly order Tesla but I remember remain open if a year from now Tesla says look we made 50 billion dollars selling Tesla Bots at their their robots to other manufacturing companies and mining companies to do this you know routine work then I'm going to have to change the story so what I'm trying to say is once you're done with the evaluation even after this class if you want to track your company what you're looking for are things that will change your story that's why when I look at analytics report that's what I'm looking for is there something in this report that will lead me to shift my story because that's what's going to shift my valuation significantly I couldn't care less would you meet your earnings per share estimate by two cents or seven cents those are not the things that change your story so how many companies have we actually valued in this class so far outside I mean in the class itself it's a quick question you haven't valued a single one we've done pieces of company a little piece of Airbnb a little costly capital for some valuation classes why aren't we valueing companies because you've got to lay the groundwork I'm now ready so what I'd like to do is actually value companies and you're going to go bang bang we'll spend five ten minutes each valuation I want don't want to drag you through the details because by now you should know the details of free cash flow the firm and cost of capital I want to focus on what I find interesting in each company which makes it different otherwise why do 12 companies all the same so I'm gonna lay the ground okay with each company I'm going to tell the story behind my valuation what's driving so I want to kind of make that almost part of the process and with each valuation I'm going to focus on a specific aspect of the company do some general assumptions okay let's start easy first company I'm going to value the company called Con Ed you know what corner does all those lights up there basically Corner cornet is the power company for New York City you work at cornet okay so if you want so if the lights go out you should look towards him it's a regulated utility I'm going to start easy in the sense I'm going to Value the stable growth dividend discount model you know what's so great about a stable growth dividend discount model it's almost no work at all right you get the dividends next year divide by the cost of equity minus growth rate you're tempted right you're saying why can't I use a stable growth dividend discard model I could be done in five minutes now to use a stable growth dividend discount model your company has to fit so let me take you through the tests I read to decide that this was a good candidate for a stable growth dividend discount first I said is the company paying dividends like a stable company so if you have a dividend payout ratio of five or ten percent for God's sakes don't use a stable growth dividend discount model because your company's paying out too little in dividends of mature slow growth companies should be paying out much more and if you look at uh Con Ed was paying 73 of its earnings history so it's paying out a big chunk of Exotics second I wanted to make sure I hadn't picked a high Growth Company so I looked at the retention ratio which if you're paying on 73 is 47 and the return Equity is a 7.7 you take the product with those two I get an expected growth rate of 2.1 percent this is okay it's a stable growth rate how do I make the Judgment whether it's okay I just compared to my risk free rate of 4.1 it's well below so it's a paying dividends like a mature company it's growing at a rate less than the growth rate of the economy and I said third is a cost of equity that I'm looking at consists with the Material Company mature companies don't have cost of equity debate or 1.8 so and the answer is that looks pretty reasonable in fact the cost of equity was about 7.7 and so the actual return Equity was also 7.7 are you surprised by that what's that regulating regulated utility you know what a regulated utility is required to do right they have to go in front of a Regulatory Commission when they want to raise prices you know how regulatory commissions decide whether you can raise prices they look at your return equity it's one of the few business with the cost of equity is incredibly consequential because it actually determines how much you can raise prices because it will not let you earn well above the cost of equity they play games still around them so to Value this company I'm going to use a stable growth dividend discount what does that mean taking the dividends in the most recent year two dollars and 32 cents growing it at 2.1 percent for the next year that gets you expected them in the next year you always need expected cash flow one year out and dividing by the difference in the cost of equity 7.7 percent and the growth rate in Perpetual 2.1 that's it all you need is three numbers dividends last year cost of equity growth rate and the value per share you get is 42.30 Scott was actually trading in 4076. am I surprised that my values close the price this is as close to a bond as you're going to get in the stock market you get a big dividend the dividend grows at a slow rate but whenever you get a value different from the price you're asking what if so here's the word if you maybe I got the growth rate wrong maybe the growth rate should be a little lower so I talked about backing out of it but before I do that that value that I get a 40 to 30. discounted cash flow valuations our values as of right now you think so what a lot of equity research reports like to talk about Target prices which is what you expect the price to be a year from now can somebody help me out there and converted DCF value so let's say you're at an interview people say oh it looks like you can do a DC evaluation but we do Target prices here how would you convert a DCF value into a Target pricing okay yeah current value grow it out by what at what rate at the cost of equity is that enough that tells me the total 7.7 comes from two places right part of it comes from dividends and part of it comes from Price appreciation there's one additional step so you take the 4230 you grow it out at 7.7 percent and then you subtract out the expected dividend and you're going to come up with like 44. it's a Target price if I see what's the Target price two yes from now you now have a template you can you can dazzling do you want just Target price one of you I can give you the next 10 years you'll have no idea why you put it up extremely impressive but all you're doing is take that expected return building it up and in fact if you buy the stock today at 40.76 and your value is right and you hold the stock for a year and the market adjusts to your value you're not going to go from 40 70 40 76 to 40 to 30 you're going to go to the 44.31 cents which is your Target price so get comfortable once you've got a DCF value you can give me a Target price one year out five years out all it requires is using your cost of equity as your expected return and netting out any dividends that might be paid that reduce your price during that period so non-dividend paying stocks it's actually very trivial just take the price today you can get expected price one year from now so people often ask me you came up with the valuation of Tesla you know 151 four years ago it's at 182 today I can't compare the 180 to the 151 then but if you take the 151 then and you look at the projected price I would have today you'd have a number that's more comparable because otherwise you're comparing valuations across time take a second valuation go to 3M what does 3M do extremely boring things that make a lot of money the guy who invented the post did not to get a Nobel Prize right look at them all over the place in spite of all the digital age we live in I see post notes stuck all over the place so I value 3M on September 12th of 2008. serious no it's What's significant about September 12th in 2008 I did it during the day after close of trading that day Lehman said they were in trouble and by Monday the prices have kicked out so the valuation I did of 3M and I'll be quite honest I did not see the crisis coming that evening when I was doing the valuation I'd love to tell you the foresight to see the whole thing maybe no real rubini did but I did not Nuri has been seeing crisis every day since that no it's like the ER of of markets or it could collapse now the world could come to an end okay but I did not so my original valuation at 3M reflects the fact that I don't see the storm coming and I valued it as a company that basically earned a tremendous return on Capital that posted note is actually patented as high growth it's just it's a com it's a valuation of an upbeat growing company it's still a big company but it's a growing company with strong barriers the value per share that I got was 83.55 it's nothing interesting you could pretty much then the crisis I Revisited my valuation a couple of weeks after the crisis and remember the numbers are still the same I'm still looking at the same financials and what's changed the world has changed around remember I talked about how intrinsic values are not takes forever so it changes when you have a crisis first when you have a crisis what happens your risk premiums jump right that four and a half percent equity risk became a six percent at risk premium the default spread at White even though the rating hadn't changed so the first thing that happened the cost of capital changes your risk free rate goes down I did a lot for the fact that in the near term this is also going to slow the economy down by bringing that growth rate down nothing fundamentally if you look at the data nothing in the data data change but I have to reflect the changes going on around I hope and pray you don't have a market crisis between March today and May 8th but if you do it's not a big deal right the numbers are going to be changing are numbers that reflect that crisis you're going to have a much higher cost to Capital perhaps a greater failure rate and that's why it's good to have these levels under your control you're saying oh my God where do I do I stop doing valuation that's not a choice because you have to think about investing in good times as well as in bad times so as you look at the 3M valuation you have a template for what do I do when there's a crisis and crises change the price of risk they could affect the economy and the mechanisms you have for showing that are right under your control this class was in the we were right in the middle of class and copied it this was the peak covet pattern and people said should we still finish the project and say heck yes you have to finish the project I can't just let you get out of here so we can't value companies and say why not there's a crisis around us just because it's a crisis doesn't mean there's no such thing as value it might have a much lower value today than you did four weeks ago before the crisis but the mechanisms are there and sometimes it's actually good to deal with the crisis because you learn how to adjust your numbers for a crisis so we would stop there and then Monday we will pick up with more valuation I was trying to close the free cash flow equities you can inform that again and so I managed to do it but if I don't consider it have otherwise the difference is exactly uh but you need free cash flow what did you start with I started with net oh no sorry I started with trunk I subtracted the interest from the market uh valuable chat that I calculated times the free tax cost of that times one minus taxes in the end it's uh after attack yeah and I added the net borrowing which would be relative to the growth of the actors so it fits perfectly right except that if I consider cash then there is this cash difference because I'm adding value in the first application form and prefectual Equity you have so which one is higher see frequency operating assets so the question was exactly like can I do that and then add that cash what's my what's your value of cash earning three percent in two days right you take the camera you project at the end time you discount it back as we presented so basically so that so the fact that you start with free cash flow firm basically means your what you valued in your Equity is your non-cash equity in your non-cash operating ass perfect so now you got to bring in cash and if you want to you can actually install the Crossovers because your free cash to the firms before class holding this so if you add cash and cross Holdings you'd have to do the same thing with your record evaluation as we didn't prefer so it makes sense to add that cash I tell you when you shouldn't add back cash do you start with the actual stated net income when you work down to free cash flow that's because cash income is included exactly then you don't add back cash it's a very sloppy way of dealing by discounting that Vector because if I adjust net income and I subtract the cash income exactly I can add back cash again as long as you have no cross hypers cross okay yeah uh you need from Minority because Muhammad are interested you're on five percent of another company it is not in your so in your net income are you netting those out as well are you leaving them in your network uh I don't know that's a problem with the starting net income and that increment to its income for cash income with all the other crap so you've taken all that crap you've attached one cost of equity based on the operating risk in your company you're discounting all this other stuff that might have very different risk characteristics of the cost of equity and so it's often better if you're doing an accurate evaluation to strip those out of your net income value the equity which is what you're doing right now and you do the so when you start a free cash flow and work the way you did you're doing exactly that you're cleaning you're doing just yeah the income in the operating assets value the equity operating assets and do exactly what you did with free cash flow yeah I don't have for that at that beta or cash no it's beta that we use is actually just a beta for the business part of Business Without considering that I remember in some cases just okay if you use a dividend discount model you have to adjust the cash because there you have no choice right your dividends come from all income it's not like only from non-cash income so when you use a dividend discount model your beta then has to be reduced or it's like the fact that a lot of cash or say for companies so the key is to think that I'm valuing the net operation the key is to ask yourself whatever value and then ask whatever not bad you get because you know your cash flows reflect whatever what you value so this something that is creating income that is not in your cash flows you haven't valued it yet that's a rational for adding cash adding minority interests and other companies you know same Russian alpharettes I mentioned exactly yeah I found one I go to like update it like later on [Music] the preferences are Excel wide it's not spreadsheet specific to do the spreadsheet go to another spreadsheet come back to the spreadsheet that iteration so check the iteration box this sounds like the iteration box is not the iterations are not working thank you thank you very much and being a realistic about it um yeah so usually okay yeah yeah precarious um yeah yeah [Music] but I just made me all right um okay yeah I was there during Thanksgiving break my husband's from Dallas so I go to Dallas yeah awesome I did uh okay okay um solver function that you mentioned okay okay um [Music] I think people have relationships like data analysis or something okay okay and so what would be your big job better like that theoretically you know just because 
that's sort of things thank you thank you very much hey um just in case you have forgotten your DCF valuations if you want them for feedback I Do by Friday I don't I won't put a Time sometime Friday I think but I hate to be the bearer of bad news but you know what's coming up next Monday right you have no idea [Music] second quiz is next Monday okay you have no time if you've been working on your DCF project you know since been working on them the bulk of what the next Quiz is going to be which is everything from growth to all the mechanics of valuation so your next Quiz is next Monday so first 30 minutes same same kind of rules as the first quiz so just to get you ready so I'll put up the review session and the past quiz is up today so it'll show up I'll send it as a link on your email it'll also be on the webcast page for the class so when you get a chance you know if you feel you have enough time to to open it up you're welcome there so today I want to talk about valuing individual companies as you remember in the last session I did a valuation of Con Ed used it as a vehicle to talk about using DCF values to get Target prices you take the value to take and you forecast out what the price will be one year from now two years from now and then I looked at 3M and how a crisis can change your valuation for a company even though none of the numbers change so today I'm going to continue that I'm going to talk about valuing the S P 500 and then I'm going to go off into on into the d-pad I'm going to call you know we're going to embark on what I call the dark side evaluation sounds mysterious it's about difficult to Value companies but today I want to start with a couple of questions so one is very closely related to what you're doing right now so value your company you're going to get a value per share unless it's a very unusual valuation or you've played games your value per share is going to be different from the market price let's take that as a given how different is going to vary across companies but you've got a value got a price and you're trying to explain it so let's go through the explanation can you tell me which one you would attach the most no most meaningful first is you are right in the market is wrong it requires a particularly large ego but maybe that's where you will end up right it's a it's a very dangerous place to be which is you feel that you own The High Ground and everybody else is stupid think of all those other people in the market is saying the second is you're wrong and the market is right if that's where you end up essentially that's where you end up because you know where the end game then is right at the end of this class this will be the last valuation you ever do and you're going to put your money in index funds and you're saying why am I wasting my time it's an incredibly useful productive result of the class because think of how much money you and time you're going to save not chasing after drapes but it does mean that your valuation career is going to be over on May 8th you're done the third is your botron that actually is the truth the market doesn't have some magic crystal ball think of it as Yelp review for a restaurant versus your review right yeah preview is not always right I've gone to restaurants where I said really this kind of 4.8 Stars I don't believe it okay you're both wrong and what you have to hope is you're less wrong than the market that's really what we're this is not about being right because we're all making guesses for the future who knows what the future will bring you can't obviously both be right that's the one choice that's off the table but you can both be wrong and you say please God let me be a little less wrong than the market that's what we're hoping for so don't put the weight of the world on your shoulders and at the end of your evaluation how do I know I'm right because you're not going to be right you're going to be wrong but you brought down the temperature and said no I don't have to be right I just have to be less wrong there's the second question I would ask and this is kind of a this is a kind of a technical question how many of you are valent young companies any particularly in a young company okay do you have 40 cash flows look like in your one year two year three negative right now when you get Negative cash flows what are we implicitly assuming the company is going to be able to do yeah no no this is this is even this is not the all the market share stuff is already done it's in your revenues it's in your margin but I'm asking about that negative 1 billion in free cash flow you get in Year One to keep get to year two what does the car and to get all of your future your Nirvana to come through what do we implicitly assuming that capital is coming into the firm are we assuming some mix of capital you are right in your cost to Capital you tell me your debt is five percent your Equity is 95 you're implicitly telling me you're going to raise capital and a big part of it is going to be new equity which means you're going to issue new shares right but here's what I did in your valuation tell me whether I've messed up I took the present value of your cash flows I came up with the value of equity today and then I divided by what the number of shares you have seems like I've left a gap right because to cover those negative cash flows will I not have to issue new shares in the future I will so how come I'm ignoring them I'm actually doing the right thing but tell me because this is a question you're going to get asked why aren't you adjusting your share count for the fact that you will have to issue new shares in the future via young company and there will be delusion why are you not do it but that doesn't fully answer the question you still have to ask the value is based on your forecast for the future so if you're projecting everything else in the future shouldn't you also be factoring in the increased share count you will have still not good I mean it's it's bringing cash in but complete the process when I did my DCF value what did I do I took your cash flows including the negative cash flows in year one and two and three and because that big negative cash flows what did I do I lowered the value of equity for those negative cash flows that's a dilution effect already embedded in your present value if I now divide by the shares outstanding with the shares that I'll be issuing in the future I'll actually be double Counting so when you do traditional discount cash flow evaluation this is a blessing because you're not going in the circular logical how many shares will I should your one year two year three it's already in there and people said where here's the simplest way to show it compute the value without those negative cash flows in the first three years compute the value that you got with the negative cash flows you're going to get about I'm going to do Amazon today in 2000 I'll get a value about 20 percent lower because I counted the negative cash flows that's the dilution effect already embedded and it saves us a huge amount of Torment of trying to because think of otherwise what you'll have to do you'll have to estimate what the price per share would be one year from now how many shares will be issued no you don't want to get into that cycle but if you do a discounted cash flow evaluation right the dilution is already embedded in your value yes it works no matter what right so if you go negative positive back to negative remember when you do a discounting what are you doing with the Positive cash flows you're removing from the company you can't assume the cash flow stay in the company even though they might decide to do that if you discount the cash flow you're effectively removing it from the company so you're leaving with the zero cash balance and then if you have a negative cash flow and you have seven you have to come up with the whole process again now in Practical terms of the company would probably do is they will not give you the cash flow in which case your effective cash flow will be zero in that yeah that positive cash flow here they'll keep the cash flow to cover the negative cash flow because it's more practical you save initial in scores but that's the nice thing about doing DCF right is you are already factoring in dilution you got a question door I'm sorry when we are raising more by it should be more share if you have anything more into DVR and then we are very more dead as well so only the but you said that right nothing in the evaluation comes from me when you gave me a debt Ray should use on the cost of capital you were telling me how you were raising Capital so if you don't like the fact that I'm using a lot of debt all you need to do is go to your caustic capital and reduce your debt ratio over time and I'll say okay nothing in your valuation so what I'm trying to say is don't blame me or whatever your value is it's coming from one of your assumptions if you don't like it Go and fix the assumption but there's always this open question what if a year from now I'm unable to raise capital you see how that can happen we're right now in a VC freezes talk about how Silicon Valley Bank is going to make it even worse you're a young company what did you assume you'd assume the year from now two years from now three years from now that'd be BCS coming in with capital risk capital if it's not there guess what happens what happened in 2001 when the.com boom bust 95 of.com companies cease to exist that's why I put in the failure rate so when you have companies with negative cash flows of the first five or six years one of the things I would expect to see in your failure rate is a higher failure rate simply because you have to leave open this possibility that even though things might look good now they might not look good two or three or four years from now companies with cash burn are more exposed to that risk than companies without that cash burn okay so let's go back and today we're going to start the sessions it looks awfully dark you guys are going to fall asleep here nursing a hangover I'm sorry but I have to have the lights on So today we're going to start with an unconventional valuation we valued Con Ed company we valued 3M a company and each of you is valuing an individual company but can I value an entire index using a discounted cash flow model I don't say why not when you buy the S P 500 what do you effectively Buy the 500 largest market cap stock companies in the US in proportion to their market value because that's how the index is constructed if you did actually buy all 500 companies in proportional Market pad would you be getting cash flows from those companies absolutely right and if I wanted to do this the long way I could compute the free cash order for for each of the companies add them all up but that's going to be tedious and Incredibly messy because they'll have different growth patterns mature companies growth companies so I'm going to cheat because what I'm going to do to Value the index this was in September 20th of 2022 but I'm an updated version from January 1st 2023 which you can bring up to April 1st if you want you know wait a couple of days do the valuation again so I'll take you through the process you could replicate it because this is a question you get asked all of the time especially if you're viewed as somebody who does valuation is a market undervalued over value I'll tell you up front I don't like going there because it's not my investment philosophy because when you say the market is undervalued overvalued you are a market time and I don't think I had the ammunition to be a successful Market Diamond why because with individual companies you could talk about doing more research having fresh Insight seeing something in a company that nobody else sees I cannot make that statement about any aspect of the index especially in index like the S P 500 most tracked and followed index in the world but if pushed to the wall you say can you value the index I'm going to try so let's start to Value the index on a discounted cash flow basis I need expected future cash flows right I could go the full ride and compute free cash flow to the firm for the entire index but it's messy because our banks in there I have insurance companies we're Computing free cash flow to the firm is going to be difficult to do so I'll admit I give up up front trying to compute free cash flow and here's how I'm going to cheat I'm going to look at what these companies collectively returned as cash flows last year let's let's not get ambitious let's look at what they returned what am I implicitly assuming that while some companies might return more than they can afford to it some companies can return less collectively companies are not going to do crazy things of returning 50 more so to estimate how much I returned I looked at how much they paid a stiff it's the old-fashioned waivers that's the only way companies return cash but if I stop there I'm underestimating the cash flows Equity investors collectively receive from companies because if you look at 20 at 2022 I think two-thirds of the cash flows returned took the form of BuyBacks so what I started with was dividends and Buybacks in the most recent year and the question I have to ask is what will those numbers look like in the future so I'll frame the valuation September 2022 was a particularly tricky time inflation had come back everybody people were starting to talk about recession for the first time and they're saying there's going to be a recession they blame the FED of course but the recession was coming because inflation was out of control so you're with the big questions that I was looking at in value in the index first is I'm not going to be projecting earnings for individual companies so I'm going to cheat and look at projected earnings that analysts have for the for the index and you know there are I think about 12 or 15 analysts who track the entire index and their entire life is forecasting earnings for the index the collective earnings I had access to those numbers just like each of you has it's a page it's publicly available so the first question I had was are analysts incorporating the effect of an expected recession into earnings because we know earnings is going to be so I want to start with that question second I I wanted to also think about what inflation would do to my discount rate we know as inflation goes up interest rates go up but we also know that as inflation goes up the uncertainty about inflation increases risk premiums got so the three big questions were are the forecasted earnings that I'm seeing for the index over optimistic because they're not factoring in a recession what will happen to the percentage of those earnings that get returned in cash you're saying why would that why would that change remember that companies return more cash when they feel comfortable and the economy is doing well and less cash if they feel uncertain about the future so if I can answer those four questions in effect I can value the index here's what the base your numbers look like analyst projection for earnings in 2022 was 225.3 analyst projections are always in what I call index units the reason index units are different from what you look at billions of dollars is you have to convert it all into the same number of units at the index the S P 500 is it whatever you know two three thousand eight seventy five then everything has to be converted from whatever the actual dollar values to those units so 225.3 is the expected earnings 2022 243.5 was the expected earnings in 2023 according to Atlas my job if I'm valuing the index is to say others too high is the recession going to lower those the t-bond rate at the time I looked at it was about 3.8 something percent said will that go up or go down as inflation goes up so effectively those are the questions I'm going to frame my valuation so let's start with what analysts are projecting economics so what you see in this table is analysts projections of earnings in 2022 and 2023 by month of the year in 2022. Remember at the start of 2022 nobody was talking about a resection in fact the talk was upbeat you know people were talking about how the economy is going to come back stronger what I was trying to figure out is as I went from January 2022 to September of 2022 where analysts getting more pessimistic about future earnings as talk of a recession went up you can decide for yourself but if there's an effective recession on these expected earnings you can hardly see it it's almost like Atlas live in a different Universe than macro economists are forecasting recessions I'm not saying analysts are wrong macroeconomists are just as likely to be wrong but at least in the perspective analyst if there's going to be a recession it seems to be an earnings effect free recession the earnings don't seem to be reflecting much of a change file that away because you're going to get a chance to come back and say maybe they're wrong maybe they're overestimating them so that's the first step second I looked at what percentage of those earnings had been returned to investors in dividends and BuyBacks every year in this century I don't want to go back to the last century because things have obviously shifted away in how cash gets returned so starting in 2001 I look at the percentage of earnings that gets returned in dividends in BuyBacks so in 2001 that percentage was 41 but as you I'm sorry it was 77 but as you go through time you can see there are years in which that number has exceeded a hundred percent and on average across those 22 years you get about 80 to 85 percent of cash flows being returned to investors again you can say that's too high that's too low but that's what the pattern of cash flows is big now cash return has been over the course of this century you get a chance to make a judgment of what will that be going forward so I you can see the earnings from analysts you can see the cash return so I'm going to give you my S P 500 story and the emphasis is mine you could look at the same numbers and come to very different judgments but in September 2022 here's what I forecast first I looked at those earnings and I my belief was that analysts are underestimating the impact a recession will have or not by how much I forecasted drop in earnings of about 15 for 2023 from the recession and a spillover effect into 2023. into the following year as a recession went so my earnings numbers are going to be lower than the analyst estimates because I think a recession will damage those earnings more than analysts are forecast you might look at the same numbers and come up with an even bigger cut if you feel the recession is going to be deeper or nothing at all if you feel there's going to be no recession for the cash return now in the 12 months leading into September of 2022 companies have returned about 90.5 percent of the earnings in the form of dividends in BuyBacks I don't think they can sustain that especially as they get more uncertain about the future I think that number is going to Trend down not overnight but over the next five years down to 80 so I'm projecting lower earnings and analysts I'm projecting less cash return and then return to the discount rate in September 2022 I felt that the bulk of the inflation increase had already been built into t-bonders now you can see why your evaluation can be different from mine if you are more bearish on inflation Staying High you might say that's not true I think t-bond rates could end up at six percent I think four percent is about where we're going to end up so I felt the bulk of the inflation had already been built in so I left the keyboard rates pretty pretty close to where they they were in September 2022. and finally if you look at the equity risk premium the equity risk premium I use this framework to compute an implied premium here I get to make a judgment on premiums because if you just use the implied premium you know what you're going to find right by definition implied premium gives you a value equal to the index here I'm trying to Value the index I used an average the premium of five percent which is close to the average Equity risk premium just in this Century if I go back to 1960 that premium is much lower but I don't think we're going to go back to that lower premium so collection of assumptions lower earnings less cash returned over time a t-bond rate that's going to settle at four percent so I don't see this bullish view of t-bond rates going back to two percent and Equity risk premiums of five percent yes because there you're using a growth rate equal to the risk credit which means there'll be recovery Euros after that year recession years and because you're not able to forecast when that's why when people look at my terminal growth rate they complain that it's too low I say it looks too low because you're thinking about good years but there will be bad years and over time I'm smoothing it out and using a growth rate that they can sustain in perpetuity in other words I could change that I could give you a second shot that doesn't have to be I've left it at five percent but maybe I can give you a second shot say in your stable growth do you want to use a lower premium or a higher premium so it's an input you can add on so I I did not hear it so it's five percent all the way through so with those assumptions the value that I got for the index was about 35 15. I was surprised it was as close to the index value as I got and you know why right because people always think about analysts driving the market if analyst numbers if I did not build in that that drop of 15 in earnings I would actually ended up with 3 800. as my valuation you know what this tells me markets don't over the markets have their own views about earnings what analysts are telling you might be what you see out there on CNBC or On The Wall Street Journal but Market projections of earnings are often much more realistic than what analysts are projecting but this is a framework you can use to revalue the index at the start of this year I value the index and I did actually Four scenarios one of high inflation and a recession think of that the worst case scenario stagflation one of low inflation and a recession one of low inflation and no recession which is the most benign scenario and one of you know basically High inflation and nothing happening basically which is that we live with five percent inflation what's the big deal I get values for the index ranging from 3 400 as I think my low value to 4 300. and this year we've been moving between 3 800 and 4200 each month so you've got January where everybody's upbeat the benign scenario look like it was playing out we're at 4 100. February people woke up terrified moved back down to 3 800. I have a feeling that you're going to see this bad play out through the course of this year because nobody really knows what the end result here is going to be but inflation and the economy in spite of the banking crisis inflation and economy are going to stay front and center in where the market goes so any questions on valuing an index can you value the sensex or the the best by using it I don't see why not it's going to be Messier because what you will lack is that top-down analyst estimate of earnings you might have to do bottom-up estimates which are Messier but the process stays the same right take the index cash flows apply the same process that you used to Value an individual company to Value an index and you can make the same kind of judgment about any market and any index that you choose to value I want to do this with a banking index because I want to know whether the collective response to SBB has kind of made Banks collectively undervalued they are willing to take a stand on my valuation where no because we know what Panic does to sectors so maybe backing out what the fair value of the banking index is with reasonable numbers about what this will mean can be a good way to get past the smoke and the noise that's been thrown up because of the banking crisis and in fact when I did my September valuation I did compute what the value of the index would be as a function what my risk free rate would be because the reason I did this was I knew I'd get pushback from people with strong views on rates rates are going back to two percent rates are going back to six percent I don't own The High Ground I've used four percent but it's my estimate and with Equity risk premiums ranging from four percent which is the long-term historic average to five percent which is what I use to six percent which has been at the upper end of the risk premium so the last 22 years so you tell me your story for the economy and inflation I'll pick a number there and say that's a number that best fits your story and you should probably act consistent with that story then because your story and numbers will match up so now let's move to what I think is the real reason for even spending a class evaluation I'm going to call this a dark side evaluation it's the title of one of my books and I'll give you a history of how I picked the title but the dark side evaluation is basically a reflection of the fact that some companies are more difficult to Value than others in fact to frame this entire section on the dark side which is the rest of my intrinsic valuation sessions I'm going to talk about the four questions and I brought these four questions up in the very first class that you need to answer the value any company so as you value your company implicitly or explicitly these are the four questions you needed to answer first is what are your cash flows from existing Investments if you're a young company the answer is not much but you can see it varies across companies mature company or young company think of that as the easiest of the four questions to answer because you can look at the current financials the current earnings the current cash flows the second question might be the most difficult question to answer in valuation is what is the value that is added or destroyed by Future growth notice how I phrase that I didn't ask you what's your future growth because we know growth has a good side and a bad side the good side of growth is makes your revenues and earnings higher the bad side of growth is you have to reinvest to get that growth the net effect can be positive or negative and I'm asking for your company what is more like which means you have to understand the barriers to entry the competitive advantages the business your company is and what competition it might face the third question I'm going to ask you is how risky are the cash flows notice I don't ask you what's your beta don't mistake models for end questions even if you don't like the cap bam you don't like betas you still have to deal with risk you still have to incorporate the effective risk into value and finally I'm going to ask you when will your company become a mature company why do I need the answer to that because that's when I put closure and I put a terminal back so if you think about evaluation it's answering these four questions that leads you to a value so I'll start by making an obvious statement when those questions are easy to answer valuation becomes easy so if you're valuing a company with a long history Con Ed why this question easy to answer because it doesn't have a whole lot of competition it's got a long history it's a regulated you turning each of those questions becomes easy to answer if every company you valued was like Con Ed you don't need this class but was I don't need you you see why I could get chat GPT to Value every company right it's mechanical if it's mechanical a machine can value a company much more efficiently than you can so be thankful for the dark side the Dark Side of companies where these questions are difficult to answer what kinds of companies would be that will fit that if you're wearing a young company and we'll go through this in details each of these four questions becomes equivalent of pulling teeth hateful if you're buying a company that doesn't fit the accounting mode valuation becomes more difficult because you got to move things around right r d has to capitalize all the numbers have to be restated and finally if you have a company with significant truncation risk what's truncation risk Well normally when you think about cash flows you think about being wrong your three cash flows are wrong right you know truncation risk is will there be a year three that risk is difficult in corporate traditional valuation so companies which are distressed companies that face nationalization risk companies that face a regulatory Crackdown are more difficult to Value than companies that don't it's a whole host of companies in those three groups so let's talk about what it is about about companies that are difficult value and I'm going to hit a whole host of companies in the next in this session and the next one I'm going to start by talking about valuation across the life cycle why are young company so difficult to Value what are the challenges and how do you overcome them mature companies you think are easier unless they're going through a restructuring but they're going to change their business model because the history no longer is useful and declining companies are downright depressing to value because you're asked to do things that don't come naturally putting a negative Revenue growth rate margins that decrease over time it goes against human nature to be that pessimistic but you have to be so we're going to talk about those three groups of companies first then I want to talk about the challenges in value Emerging Market companies I'm going to argue that 90 of what you do in Emerging Markets has looked like what you're doing in a developed Market you can't change the basic drivers cash flows growth and risk but there are estimation challenges with the Emerging Markets related to cross Holdings related to regulatory overlay related to government interference that are more difficult and you got to deal with those and finally I want to talk about value companies in different sectors right now you know the sector that should give you nightmares valued specs think of what right right now everything is on in motion you know regulatory changes are coming Capital changes are coming the way banks are running is going to be different so I'm going to talk about valuing Banks why I used to say banks are the easiest of all companies to Value pre-2008 what happened in 2008 to change my mind how I changed the way I value companies after 2008 and how 2022 might cause more changes in the way we value Banks I want to talk a little bit about commodity encyclical companies what makes them different even the most mature Oil Company doesn't have stable earnings you know why because oil prices move the difference commodity encyclical companies is there's a macro effect on your earnings and cash flows that will dominate the micro effects and you got to talk about what is what do we do differently then if you're worried about oil prices all the time how do you factor that into evaluation and finally I want to talk about companies with intangible assets I'm going to go back to what we did with r d but I'm going to actually take a company and value it with r d capitalized and without capitalizing r d so you can see why we bother doing it you're going to see the shift in value you get when you do the right thing so let's start with young companies okay I'm gonna make you an entrepreneur you started a new business lots of prompts and you asked me to value a company so I come and ready with my four questions ready so first question I ask you what are your cash flows from existing assets what's your answer going to be what existing assets I don't even own the chair I said it that was easy let's move on now I see what's your value from future growth you say a lot can you be a little more specific not really right you don't have a product you don't know what Market you're going after then ask you how risky are you Barry but beyond that what can you offer me they don't know betas price so there's no historical data and I ask you when will you be a mature company fall out of your chair laughing you don't even know whether you'll make it through tomorrow you don't have enough cash flows now do you see why people don't even try to value on companies every single question becomes a nightmare to answer so what do VCS do the price companies I've never met a BC who can sensibly value something but that doesn't seem to matter right you price things you sell it to a higher price for a successful BC so let's talk about making this even more challenging so young companies are difficult to Value but they get even more difficult to Value if you're in a sector where every other company looks just like you all young companies all money losing all with small revenues because effectively I've taken away all your ammunition right when you sat down to value a company think of what the first thing you reached out for last 10K last annual report second thing you looked at was the company's history we had access to S P CAP like you you downloaded that data third thing you looked at was industry averages why because you wanted to get a sense what happens to my company as it gets larger and more mature think of what I've done in this scenario I've given you a young company it has no history so that's gone you look at its current financials there's very little you're learning about the company because it's losing money not much in Revenue saying that's okay I look at the industry averages but if every company looks just like yours you're learning nothing from the industry averages you have no financials no history no comparables this is the trifecta you want to avoid in valuation because in a sense you're in a nightmare scenario and when you're in this scenario the dark side will back you know what the dark side will say things like oh it doesn't matter valuation doesn't matter in AI at all valuation always matters the fact that you cannot value something doesn't mean it stops mattering but you'll also see these devices used by people who can't value young companies but want to invest in them anyway first is they'll talk about Paradigm shifts you know what that means I have no idea what's going on so I'm going to call it a paradigm shift in my lifetime I've seen at least five Paradigm shifts which have been neither paradigms nor ships because they seem to shift back two or three years later I was told in 1999 there will never be a recession again I'm not kidding go back and look at news stories from 99 people are convinced that technology had solved the recession problem forever why because technology you don't have the kinds of booms and bus here with manufacturing it sounded credible in 1999 as markets were booming Paradigm ships second whenever you ask somebody about a company rather than talk about the company they talk about macro stuff why should I buy Arabian electric cars everybody's going to have electric cars why should I buy you know whatever snowflake because cloud computing is here to stay if you don't believe me just watch a Kathy Wood interview about all of the companies and every single company she's asked about she gives a macro story you think what's wrong with that could could the electric car market be huge in 2032 and rivien be a terrible company absolutely telling me a macro story just takes me half the way you got to complete the story by saying this is why I think this company will benefit from that story I still remember in 2014 Alibaba went public and for those of you not familiar with Alibaba Alibaba pulled off an amazing feat it beat Amazon Head to Head in China and recently it beat all comets because in 2002 or three it was a tiny company so in 2014 it went public and at the time of the IPO you know one of the biggest IPOs of all time happening on the NASDAQ I decided to Value the company so it's still on my blog if you want to go check it out so I valued it and I called it my the China story not the fake China story where you throw in China after the fact to get a premium but a true China story why did I use those terms because I went back and looked at why Alibaba won in China and I think they won in China because they understood that the Chinese consumer was not like an American Consumer I'll give you in fact if you want to see Alibaba at play open up a Google page right you get that box in the middle nothing and that's what you're taught in the U.S don't don't mess up the page keep it simple Focus people's attention one box in the middle you enter what you're looking for that's a Google page if you get a chance also open the taobao pitch which is the entry point you'll have to wear sunglasses right you get hit with you know 15 000 things coming at you at the same time and I think the perfect description for what Alibaba did to succeed was how what the economists called them in 2014. they call them the online Bazaar because ever been in a Bazaar nice organized places right the exact opposite's chaos but if you grew up in Asia you grew up with bazaars I still remember my mother coming here for the first time to shop and she would stop and start bargaining with shopkeepers and that doesn't work here you gone out for 25 percent less at BH audio and expect them to take your offer but that's what you're used to and Alibaba says tailored a company that basically looked at what Chinese consumed in fact in those days Chinese consumers would not leave their credit cards online because they worried about fraud so alipay was created to allow customers to say look you can shop here you don't have to leave your information and it succeeded immensely by the time it went public Alibaba at about 10 billion in revenues it doesn't sound like much but at a 50 March money-making machine so value them as a China store I put in a 25 growth rate which is what the Chinese are because and also 75 of all online retail traffic in China close you know went through an Alibaba side so clearly dominated the Chinese online retail market then mastered the market so in value it as the China story I gave it a growth rate of 25 which matched the growth rate of the Chinese online market for the next five years and then scale down but I did not let them have a growth rate higher than that because what made them succeed in China is unlikely to work even next door in India it's a very different market so in my valuation I gave them a China story but it had third legs you let revenues grow at 25 you leave margins at 40 to 50 percent the value that I got for the equity of Alibaba in 2014 was 165 billion that time the highest value it ever attached to a company going public so I come up with that value CNBC calls me and says Alibaba is going public in a couple of days would you come in and talk about Alibaba and I say yes bad mistake I'd show up they put me in a green room I don't even know why they call it a green room it's neither green nor a room but must become carry over from some history and I'm sitting there waiting to go on and this guy comes and I recognize him as an equity research analyst I almost feel the urge to flee but he comes in anywhere and you know says what are you here I'm supposed to talk about audible I said me too it's like okay so you get on and I say I value Alibaba at 160 bill you see and he says it's what at least twice as much I said why this is China I said what does that even mean my entire 160 billion is coming from China there's no other country in the world we could get this higher value but that's a macro story all you do to justify a company says electric cars how do you push back against this of course electric cars are big China as big but you can't use that as an explanation for anybody but that's the dark side use a big story to justify whatever you pay and finally you see metrics in these companies you've never seen before the.com book for the first time investors were dealing with young companies money losing companies small revenues none of the traditional metrics were you know what I mean by metrics things like price earnings ratio EB to Avatar all the metrics that people have used so in the 1990s what did analysts come up with metrics to compare.com companies website market value per website visitor until Mary Mica looked at and said that's not sophisticated enough because some people come for only two minutes to your website some people come for 10 minutes she computed a market value per eyeball I'm not kidding she took the market cap of every company divided by the number of minutes people were looking were on their websites and came up market value for Iowa you're saying what's wrong with that if I ask you to pay 5 000 times Onyx for a company would you block sounds high right because you have some frame of reference typical company traded 20 times on about 500 times revenues you think that sounds like a high number if I ask you to pay 300 per eyeball you think I like my eyeballs 300 doesn't sound like much you have no frame of reference when you have no frame of reference you can pay absurd prices and not even recognize it but in the dark side that's what you will see market value per subscribe a market value per download and you have no frame of reference you say that doesn't sound High how do you know what's higher low if you've never seen it before so in the 1990s when I used to do these valuation seminars is a peek of the.com Boom at the end of the seminar a particularly aggressive member of the audience would come up to me and say you really cannot value amazon.com using a DCF model can you get a finger going like this please step back you're going to hurt me and at the risk of great personal injury I'd say yes you can value Amazon using a discounted cash flow model and they'd give me this look of total contempt I'd say academic and walk away it's not meant as a compliment basically academic basically meant you really can't value these companies you can just talk about them talked about the fifth or sixth term of being called an academic I got pissed off I say you know what I'm going to Value amazon.com 1997 I sat down to Value Amazon and here's what I ran into very quickly there was nothing in the literature on how to value a company small revenues and big losses because everything in the in the books was written for mature companies put in a growth rate use a sustainable growth equation nothing worked but I persevered and I kept a journal and every time I ran into a roadblock when nothing in the literature worked and I came up with choices I wrote in the journal what I had to do to estimate growth and margins and reinvestment and by the time I was done that journal was 75 pages long it's still on my website it's called The Dark Side evaluation can amazon.com be bad the answer is but you know give it away yes but you'll have to get all over all of these roadblocks so what I'm going to do is take you back not to 1997 but to 2000 January 2000 and the reason I picked January two thousands the peak of the.com Boom Amazon is the poster child for the and I'm going to take you through a valuation I did in January 2000. and the reason I'm going to spend time on this valuation you're going to see the seeds of your fcff simple Ginsu spreadsheet in this valuation it did not exist in 2000. so the first version showed up in 2000 because I had to build it so let me set the table January 2000 this is actually one of the first webcasts carried by aimr which is the parent Organization for the CFA any cfas in you so this is one of the very first web webcasts and in fact it was in response it came to me and said would you be willing to do a webcast on valuing these.com companies everybody seemed to be excited about them and nobody seems to know how to Value them I said yes so I'll give you a compressed version of that web cache so you're setting the tape at the time of this valuation Amazon at revenues of 1.1 billion dollars let me pause right there a U.S retail company with a billion dollars in revenues big or small it's let's get perspective what did Walmart have its revenues last year 500 billion Costco is like 50 billion even if you go back to 2000 you looked at a medium-sized the Gap at 22 billion in Revenue two thousand one billion is a tiny retail company with operating losses of 410 million so it's got small revenues and big losses I'm going to ask you a very simplistic question humor me anyway can a company with small revenues and big losses become a valuable company tops up okay because every company at some point in time is accompanying small revenues and big losses help me out and say simplistic what has to happen to the small revenues over time for it to become valuable they've got to become big revenues what do I need for that Revenue growth is my mechanism for getting from small to good what's going to happen to the losses not just reduce but they've changed signed right otherwise you're stuck so the losses have to become profit so what do I need I need a margin that I can aim for where I can say once you get past the pain this is what my margins look like that's a Target margin Revenue growth Target margin two of the inputs that I ask you and there's one final loose set and I'll talk about that loose in a minute but in the case of Amazon let me show you what the growth and March I assume then I'll reverse engineer and tell you how I came up with the numbers that I did for the revenue growth I assumed a compounded annual revenue growth rate of 42 percent a euro I thought it was one of the first webcasts that AMR did I hadn't even finished saying this when the first question rolls in how come you're being so pessimistic about future growth what am I doing to revenues I'm starting with a billion I'm making it 40 billion I'm increasing your revenues 40 fold over the next 10 years and you're accusing me of being pessimistic you know why it sounded pessimistic right what what are they comparing the 42 percent to revenue growth in the most recent year for Amazon was 200 percent the question we're asking is why are you going from 200 to 42. what they did not see was that's a compounded annual growth rate my growth rate in year one is actually a hundred and fifty percent it scales down as the company gets bigger because it's going to get more and more difficult to maintain those high growth rates I thought I was telling a pretty upbeat story now of course you could say why 42 why not 35 why not 55 I'll talk about why it's a key variable driving the valuation I have to come in and provide a story that backs into that 42 percent then I turned my attention to margins right now the margins are minus 30 minus 36.7 WordPress let's do this an easy question if the margin stay at minus 36.71 forever how much is Amazon worth zero you'd have to pay me to buy Amazon in my valuation I assume that over time those margins would Converge on ten percent you're saying where do you get the 10 that was the 75th percentile of operating margins for retail companies in 2000 not online retail companies you know why not they were all losing money I assume that over time the retail part would have to dominate and I'd look at the margins for retail companies here again I get pushback how come you're being so pessimistic about margins you know the internal story was right you have online retail they don't have the cost structure that brick and mortar retail companies should have therefore their margin should be higher and even that I didn't buy that and here's why a for online retailers of lower costs and higher margin than brick and mortar retailers over time what's going to happen everybody's going to shut their brick and mortar everybody's going to go online they all have lower costs and everybody is lower cost guess what happens the prices get lower your margin shrink so I said you know if you're a consumer this is great it means you have two two places to go to buy everything in the long term I'm actually being optimistic keeping margins where they are margins collectively for retail will actually decrease with online retail as an additional way for you and I to buy stuff so again another upbeat story 42 growth 10 margins as I go through time and my margins go from negative to positive and I'll explain why they take the pathway that they do my losses become profits yeah younger as a company I would have done that and retail when you think about total market right at that time total Market would have included everything from department stores to discount retail so unlike total markets in other spaces where you have Focus total Market in retail is everything on nothing so you almost have to take a stand so if you're a younger company going after more focused Market let's say It's Entertainment software I'd start with told market and build up but if you have a company with substance and you kind of see what it's doing it's perhaps better to build off and make sure that the revenues you're giving them are not out of sync with what the total Market looks like so the total Market will come into play but it'll come into play when I check but should I use 42 or 55 30 so it's implicitly there just not explicitly there so it's miraculous right I've taken this small money losing company made it for a large money making company it's easy to do on a spreadsheet much easier than in real life but no that's the nice thing about working with the stretchy and it comes to find a little set and this is the loose end I got stuck on the longest to get your revenues from 1 billion to 41 billion might be plausible you're going after a big Market you just have to reinvest right and every mechanism I had taught and written about reinvestment wasn't working it's right sustainable growth what's the growth rate return on Capital times reinvestment rate but the return on Capital look like for Amazon in 2000. big negative number what is the reinvestment rate look like big negative number you think this is very convenient big negative number times big negative number gives me a big positive number but what the heck is a big positive number applied on the law is going to do just make the losses bigger I took the capex and depreciation the most recent year and tried to do Financial modeling disaster right because depending on your base year it can do good things or bad things you can let it so finally after lots of trial and as I said it took me almost four days to get there I said look I've got to tie reinvestment for sales it can't be the operating income it's got to be tried to sales hence was born the sales to invested Capital ratio it Still Remains a mistreat a lot of people who do discounted cash flow value in down in front of what are you doing I'm essentially sort of tying invested Capital operating income which is what you do with a sustainable growth equation I'm trying to test and here the three sales to Capital ratio three reflects what retail companies collectively for generating is revenues per invest dollar of invested Capital here again the pushback was shouldn't online retailers be more efficient because they don't need brick and mortar they don't need brick and mortar stores but guess what they need to reinvest in computers technology acquisitions those three assumptions allow me to come up with reinvestment and free cash flow and you can see already that in this upbeat optimistic story that I'm telling for Amazon okay take a look at my free cash flows minus 931 million minus a billion minus 90. so in my upbeat story I have negative free cash flows for the next six years am I surprised not in the least why not because I'm being so optimistic and this is one of the ironies the more upbeat and optimistic you get about your company the more negative your cash flows are going to be up front because you have to reinvestigate that growth now to Discount these free cash flows I need costs of capital the key word is I use the plural not one cost of capital if you ever see a young company being valued with a single cost of cap already you know you're in dicey territory because if you're taking a company from a money losing small company to a money making mature company should expect your cost of capital to change and if you look at my cost of capital it starts at 12.84 for Amazon India one small money losing company that can't afford to borrow money ends at nine point six one percent by the time you get to your debt large money making company that's able to borrow money you discount the cash flows back at the cost of capital the value that you get for the operating assets is 15.17 billion and I forgot the elephant in the room where's the Nirvana for you right up that the terminal value of 52 billion and again don't complain about the fact that the bulk of your value comes from the term and value it's a feature not a bug because when you buy Young growth companies that's what that's like the price appreciation that you get from the stock the present value you get is 15.2 billion you add cash you can see almost no cash you subtract that almost no debt you get a value for the equity of 14.8 billion and then I subtract it out remember we talked about the option overhang I subtract out options and I was flawed by how much of my value had been given away by Amazon in the previous decade and Amazon wasn't a law because you had accountants telling you it doesn't cost you much just give away millions they took it to heart the options they gave away took away 2.9 billion of my value and I divided the remaining value for the value per share I got a value of 35 dollars per share I thought I was being in fact I put no failure risk because this is the peak of the.com boom and it's how difficult can it be for a.com company to raise a billion dollars I've been upbeat on every single assumption and the reason I emphasize that the 35 dollars I got was well below the stock price of 84. now when you value company remember at the start of the class I said you value a company because you want to act on that value right step by value company a valued at 35 is trading at 20 and you asked me what are you doing I should be willing to say I'm buying otherwise what's the point of valuation and half my portfolios composed to companies I've bought because of that question a value the company somebody says what are you doing and I either have a choice of telling them I'm not buying and losing their you know attention for the rest of the valuation classes down by so ask me the analogous question here obviously and ask not asking me whether I'm buying Amazon so what's the analogous question you'd ask you my value is 35 the stock price is 84. am I shorting and I'll give you the answer that I gave on that webcast I said not in this lifetime and he's in the response was actually natural and it's just don't you have enough faith that the con I I feel more strongly that Amazon is overvalued to generate 2000 then I felt on pretty much any company that I found undervalued that I bought but there I was willing to buy and here I'm one unwilling to sell so what's the difference in January 2000 that led me to say not in this lifetime it's not confidence not knowing the duration but remember that to make money what do you have to do you have the market price that's correct so when I buy something undervalued you ask me how long am I willing to hold my answer is as long as it takes I'm not a portfolio manager I don't have the answer to client I have to answer to myself and I have a very forgiving client so if need be I waited six years and some companies to make my money back and I'm okay with it but when you sell short what do you do you borrow somebody's shares and agree to return it to them I knew this question was coming you could see it coming a mile down so before the webcast I called around Brokers to see how long they would give me on a short sale on Amazon January 2000 you know the longest time broker would give me he said you're a good client I will give you six weeks now do you say why even though I feel confident in my value I'm not willing to act on it not only do I have to be right but I have to be right within six weeks this is one of the great asymmetries in investing when something is undervalued there is a Bargain Basement strategy right you can buy and hold and wait when something is overvalued there isn't an analogous strategy on the other side which is long term which is at least easily accessible it's changed I mean things are changing you can now have long-term puts which you did not have in 2000 that you can get you know on on a subset a very high profile companies you're able to sell short now for I mean three months four months in fact I did sell short Amazon in 2018 or 19 for about six months you couldn't do that in 2000 and then there are many parts of the world where you cannot sell short period it's viewed as something you cannot do which means if you have overvaluations there's nothing really getting in the way of that bubble getting really big before it eventually eventually it bursts but you don't know when it'll happen yes variables yeah you can always but you can solve for only one variable at a time and that's always been the limits of expectations investing which is Mike mobush is one of my favorite authors books is is basically in surveilling the companies that wanting to solve for a variant it can be growth it can be margin it can be sales to Capital it can be discount rate but you can't do all four we'll talk about a more effective way of asking that what if question but you can use the solver function in Excel with your spreadsheet to solve for any single variable right basically solve for the what that variable has to be for the value to be equal to price it's useful because it tells you how much buffer you have on that assumption before your valuation starts to fall apart so what I'd like to do is use that valuation to bring home some very simple lessons about value young companies I learned in the process of valuing Amazon remember I said don't trust badish that goes in Spades with young companies if you're wearing a snowflake don't go look at the regression beta page because here's what you can see in January 2000 when I looked at the regression data page for Amazon 2.23 was the regression raw beta but there's a standard error 0.50 which means the true beta for Amazon can be anywhere from 1.2 to 3.2 so what's the solution what do we use when we don't trust the regression bidding use a bottom-up beta you and in this case I use two bottom-up eights for the first five years I use the average beta for online retailer saying the online is the part that's going to drive in the risk of the business but by year five I'm giving Amazon 15 billion dollars in revenues and 1.6 billion in operating income it's now a big retail player I moved the bottom up 8 in the second half to the beta for all retailers so that's why there's a big shift in Vegas for the first five years to be on second talk a little bit about how I came up with the numbers in other words you know what they say about about you know what Chef say about kitchens don't come into the kitchen you don't want to see me make the food I deliver even at the very top restaurants I'm going to take you to the kitchen and it's not going to be an edifying sorry because I'm going to tell you how the numbers came by so let's start with the revenue growth rate of 42 percent when I first valued Amazon I did it the way I was taught to do valuation which is sequentially you know what that means you do year one then you do your two then you do your three and I decided that by the time I was to year three I was pulling my hair out I said this isn't working for me proceeding too I'm sorry so that's when I stepped back and said look I can't project out individual years there's too much uncertainty too many things changing so rather than go what your one year to year three I'm going to do something really strange I'm going to jump to what I think this company will look like as a successful company that's your story so when you think about this story the story you're telling me but what will this company look like if it succeeds in 2000 when I looked at Amazon I like the company I like the way Jeff Bezos was running the company and I thought would succeed and I thought success would make it a pretty large retail company saying what does that even mean I didn't know what it meant so what I did was I went to download it and this is the nice thing about a space like retail with more most of the big players are publicly traded download the companies I looked at their revenues I wanted to get a sense of perspective what does a big retail company look the biggest retail company in 2000 is Walmart I think 180 billion revenues I stopped and said will Amazon end up as big as Walmart in 2000 my answer was probably not it's not a discount retailer then I looked at a couple like the Gap 18 billion said well will Amazon end up like The Gap and I said probably going to be bigger it doesn't sell this repair no almost by this process of going back and forth across the list I decided and this was my choice to make Amazon the sixth largest retailer in the world a large player but not as big as a discount retailer and not as small as a special retail it's a story of success but a success that in my mind at least gives them so in your in 2000 guess what the sixth largest retailer had roughly as revenues in inflation it just terms about 40 billion there's your secret 40 billion is my end Revenue because that's where I think it'd end up you say how do you come up with all of these growth rates I just made them up the growth rates are not the end game the growth rates you have in your DCF valuation that's not the number the number you should be focusing on is the end revenues In Your Den your growth rate is just a means for me to see how big you can make the company by your 10. so if you made a big issue with the o1 growth and said I want I think it's going to be 163.33 you can have it you want your two take it too you give me the N numbers and the beginning numbers for this valuation I control the value it's that end story that drives valuation not what you think will happen here and this is why this fixation when young companies report earnings per share strikes me as odd I mean the way investors react to the earnings per share announcement of a young company is like you having a kindergartner coming back with a report card and you take one look and say you're never going to college you might be overreacting don't you think because this is a young company what are you getting in the first six months is unless it changes the end game the story your vacuum shouldn't change that much you think what about margins well what about them I have the starting number at the ending now when I first sat with the spreadsheet all I had were blank cells between years one and ten and I'm a lazy person and I said you know what I don't want to be estimating margins in year one margins and year two margins in year three I set the spreadsheet on autopilot to fill in the numbers magically it did but I had to give it some Direction so I want you to guess what the algorithm was that allows me to get these margins in year one year two year three Etc what do you think I did to come up this awfully precise minus 13.3 second decimal point minus you must say Dave this guy must serve an amazing margin predictor let me think algorithms I'm sorry well nothing is complex I mean I'm a very simplistic thinker no logs no exponentials is a simple rule I follow what's my starting point minus 36.7 what's my ending point plus ten what's the distance between the two points 46 I moved half the distance to my goal which brings me to minus 13.35 I'm at minus 13.35 what do I want to be plus ten I moved off voicing y hat why not I'll tell you when I build spreadsheets and I'd strongly suggest when you build spreadsheets you try to do the same I want to build a spreadsheet in a way where people disagree with me they can change the pathway quickly you know what this app does right it moves me pretty quickly let's say you look at Amazon you agree with everything else in my story but you think that pathway to profitability is going to be a lot more Rocky Denmark you know all you have to do is take the half and make it a quarter in other words instead of moving half the distance I move a quarter of the distance imagine what's going to happen to margins I'm going to have more negative margins for a longer period before you turn around this is the input that I've changed in your spreadsheet to convergence year of convergence basically I'm asking how smooth is your pathway the profitability going to be if you think it's going to be really smooth you can say value of 4 I'm going to be at my target margin if you think it's going to take a lot more work and you say you're 10 I'm going to have to I'll end up with the same margin but I'll have to dig deeper and lose more money before I get there but it's a mechanism for capturing that part of the story so as my margin goes from negative to positive my operating losses become operating profits yes 75 out of all retail companies so basically that's the advantage of having the cross-sectional distribution I report only the average by sector but if you wanted to get the margins for every company you have Capital like you can download the margins for every retail company put up the distribution and make your story work now [Music] so just take the starting number and the ending number take the distance divide by two so if you take the minus 36 plus 10 that's 46.71 divide by 2 that moves me 23.35 that brings me to minus 13.35 for the first year now you're at minus 13.35 you're going to plus 10. the distance is minus 13.35 10 it's 23.35 I take half the distance it brings me to minus 1.68 so Revenue growth I just made up I just the Only Rule I followed is higher numbers up front lower numbers later but as long as you end up with 40 billion in your 10 I don't care how you get them and this is why I think angst thing about rule my revenues be 27 in year three or twenty five percent it sometimes distracts us from what the real end game is how big will this company get as a successful company oh one final thing if you look at those at those earnings you notice that in years one and two I pay no taxes for obvious reasons I'm losing money in year three still losing money year four I'm making money but I seem to be paying no taxes okay I keep track of your losses for the first three years and when you and this is the most effective way to deal with that noise is rather than keep them separate incorporate it into your cash flows because the only effect of having an nol is the taxes will save you when you first start to make money it's only in year five that I first start to pay taxes but even in year five there's an an hour left over and year six you get the full full tax rate so when you give me the marginal tax rate for a money losing company I will watch your nols for you and if you have an annual leading in I'll keep track of that user to protect your Gates taxes until you run out of the annual and then I'll push you towards your marginal tax rate third lesson to keep in mind as you look at these young companies especially with a lot of promise you're saying why do I have to stop in your debt Mr how many people said why do you stop it here why can't I go you can go to your 15 you can I mean in fact that spreadsheet can be expanded to 20 25 30 years if you know if there's nothing difficult about doing it but here's why I stop In Your Den and you can make your own judgment the study that came out of Wharton about uh 20 years ago which actually looked at IPOs okay and IPOs in most cases are companies the peak of the growth you go public when growth is speaking and they look at the revenue growth of these companies relative to the sector that these companies belong so one year after the IPO we look at the revenue growth rate it's 15 higher than the second you're saying that's why I bought these IPOs look at the how high the growth rate is lady track these IPOs the revenue growth rate is about seven and a half percent higher three years later three percent Higher by the time you get to year five you can't tell the difference in the IPO and the rest of the sector growth Fades quickly at companies the median growth period for U.S companies between three to five years when I use 10 I'm actually at the 90th percentile of growth bits for growth companies are there companies that have grown for longer than 10 years absolutely we can name them right Apple Microsoft what is the fact that we can name these companies tell you about these companies that they're the exception rather than the rule so if you feel the urge to add an extra five years do so but remember if you value a company to be an exceptional company you have no upside left for yourself as an investor so I'm going to stick with Ted but it's easy to expand that out to 15 or 20. there's no technical reason why you can't do it it's a purely investor base now let's say it's a capital ratio is a neat way to estimate reinvestment but I'll give you one reason you need to be cautious when you use sales capillary should estimate the reinvestment each year which is what I've done that becomes the change you're invested Capital it's mathematically that's always true so the reinvestment you put into your free cash flow firm is what your investor capital is changing by it's saying so what if you look at the very bottom three rows of your spreadsheet the valuation output here's what I do I project out your operating income based upon the assumptions on Revenue growth and margins I also keep track of what's happening to your invested Capital with your sales to Capital ratio assumption if I divide the after tax operating by the invested capital I come up with let's call it an imputed return on Capital you're not using return on Capital directly but whether you like it or not you're making assumptions about future return on Capital with the assumptions you're making about margins growth you're saying so what in the case of Amazon that impurity return on Capital in your day was 20.39 I took a look at that number and I was okay with it let me explain what I mean by that the median return on capital for a retail firm in 2000 was about 70 I was giving Amazon a slightly higher return but I could justify it's an online retailer it's a big player it's going to be able to have competitive advantages you know what I would not have been okay with if that would be 200.39 in your Tech my spreadsheet is sending a red signal saying you know what you're not reinvesting enough and if I'm listening what should I do I should go back and lower my sales to Capital ratio so there is a mechanism in your spreadsheet where you can track am I reinvesting too much or too little and that's why I keep track of your imputed return on Capital so you can use that signal to go back and tweak your sales to Capital ratio it's one more piece of input into what should my sales Capital ratio be in the future is whether you're ending up with a company that you can live with that you're comfortable now I talked about this at the start of the class but let me re-emphasize this with these young companies you're going to get Negative cash flows those negative cash flows in the case of Amazon have 99 Equity one percent debt are going to come from equity issuances and remember these Equity issuances sometimes you never see you know why because much of the growth for these young tech companies comes from acquisitions and guess how they pay for Acquisitions with shares so you don't even see it as an equity issuance to the market you think why am I not taking it that into account and I can do value per share because it's already in there if you look at the value that I got for Amazon the value of equity that I got would have been 3.09 billion dollars higher remember I came up with 15 billion between 18 point something billion if I did not have those negative cash flows I'm effectively knocking down value by 16 because of those negative cash flows that's a dilution effect already factored into your value and that's why I don't want to count it in the number of shares as well because that would be double count now one of the lessons I didn't take into account in general in 2000 that I've learned the hard ways of course in 2000 the.com boom bust and we realized how quickly these companies would go from promise to nothing that's failure risk and that failure risk can be substantial and this is a tough number to estimate because when you get to the spreadsheet you say well should it be 15 should be 30 so I've been looking for data that I can use to estimate failure risk and the Bureau of Labor Statistics actually maintains a very interesting database of all startups in the US in different sectors that they track over time so the way to read this if you look across all companies now one year after startup only 80 of these companies survive so 20 die in year one and every year you can see the drop-off by the time you get to your sixth in this case your seven only thirty percent of companies that started up survived to yourself there are a couple of things you learned one is a failure rate decreases the longer a companies are out so if you're buying a startup that just started up the failure risk can be sixty percent if it's been around two years that alone adds to it failure risk is lower for larger companies than it is for smaller companies simply because the investors have too much to lose it's not that these companies are somehow better but you have a 15 billion dollar market cap VCS almost have an incentive to keep it going failure risk varies across sectors it's greater in sectors like technology where you can walk away from your mistakes more easily than it's in manufacturing so this is where I started my failure risk Mission and as I said 2000 had not factored in 2001 I did but I know if you if you look at his spreadsheet I've also built in Failure risk as a function of ratings we can tell me a rating for a company I can estimate what failure risk there should be it's a work in progress It's a one number in my valuation where I'm working to come up with a better way of estimating failure risk because the young companies it could be a huge Factor in what your final value is is because the higher the failure risk the less chance there is that you would get to the elephant in the room the Nirvana number the terminal back and this is a 2019 update and you can see what percentage of companies in different sectors make it through your six your seven yeah opportunity reducing the um I just take it today I say look if I don't get to Nirvana I'm not going to get any of this value so basically I'll take it today I say okay there's a 30 chance of failure what percentage of value will you get I get a choice no I say you know is it because when you fail you liquid and liquidate you either get a percentage Book value if you have a physical asset company or a percentage of your intrinsic value if you're if you're an intangibles company so I that's it probably right now I put a percentage of your interest so if you do intrinsic value I'm bringing in the intrinsic value but I'm saying somebody buying this from you in a fire sale is going to pay only half of that intrinsic value 25 to be really pessimistic you could put in zero percent okay so that failure is can also be used for things like nationalization risk because the nationalization the very often is that the government will pay you half of what you're worth one quarter so think of Fairly risk as any kind of truncation risk and what you will get relative to fair value when that happens and it's like a decision tree basically I say it's going concern failing concern that expected value yes Lord in fact I give you a choice and you can put in enough half a fair value 25 and if you're very optimistic you might say look I'm a pharmaceutical company I have a pet and I'm going to be able to get 80 in which case the cost of failure will be very minor right because you just sell the pattern but it's never going to be a hundred percent no that's the essence of failure so I finished this valuation and somebody asked me is it possible that Amazon is worth 85 84 dollars per share somebody must have owned the stock at the time and it said possibly such a weak word and this is the expectations part I said there is a combination of Revenue growth and margins that will give you eighty four dollars I can back it out and the nice thing about a break-even table is you're actually allowing two things to vary right so basically the shade it sells are all of the values that exceed 84 dollars is it possible that Amazon is worth 84 yes but I can't invest on possibilities I have to invest in probabilities one final point and then I'll end the session and here's one thing I can guarantee if you're buying a young company you're going to be wrong a hundred percent of the time and that's okay just remember what I said at the start of this class you don't have to be right to make money you just have to be less wrong than everybody else and if you get a chance you could look at the at and get back I'll show you my forecast from 2000 for 2001 through 2010 with what actually happened over those years and you can see how off I was on some of the inputs and where I was off and how that has affected my valuations of Amazon in the years since but I'll kind of hold off on that because there's a there's the rest of the story here that I think we can learn from when you look at young companies so we'll see you on Wednesday I have some companies I will help for 25 20 years in my portfolio you know which formed every portfolio has to have a core which is companies that might be fairly valued that abortment they were undervalued but I've left them in that company like 3am call it companies like Facebook come and go now because they're more the more swings there are in the price and the value the more likely it is that a company will come and go from your portfolio the more stable value and price becomes so how about companies that used to be on companies that have now become mature companies that stay in my petroleum again even at a fairly value my bias is to leave them in there right because as long as they're fairly valued I own a Fed rate of return I can't make everything in my portfolio be about changing excess returns otherwise I'm going to be chasing my tail every year you know but I do revalue everything in my portfolio at least once a year and if something is significantly overvalued I said no and there's likely come some companies some Tesla I have bought in June of 2019 that sold in January 2026 months later because it went up 400 percent my value increased by 50 but the price increased by 40 percent so it really it drives me I don't come in with saying I have to have a long time rise because that I think is already an admission you know a failure in value I come in saying I'm willing to hold for a long period but I'm also willing to sell really quickly if the price goes up too much I don't like it when that happens because it creates more tax consequences for that I prefer to be right in the long term than right in the next six weeks saying like the tax considerations when you sell after six weeks it's treated as a as a short-term capital gain it's it's taxed as ordinary income long-term capital gains you get a much lower tax rate that's not true across the world but in the U.S short-term capital gains I pay a tax rate closer to 40 on long-term capital gains I pay tax for a closer to 15 and 20 so I'd much rather wait at least a year but in the case of Tesla I could not wait if it's just gone up too much and from a value perspective I said I'm putting too much risk by holding on to it is that just starting to realize that your class is actually more of uh uh it's like a long-term investment velocity part of it right that's why you value confidence it's part of an investment yes I'm saying value might be part of your toolkit it might not be depending on what investment philosophy now if you get a chance you go to my website I have an investment philosophies class it's a it's a free class you know we can actually watch The Sessions about why you know how do you pick a philosophy what is an impacting philosophy what goes into it what are the ingredients why would you pick a value investing philosophy versus a growth investment philosophy versus a trading class so it's a class about finding the philosophy that best fits you so 
yeah yeah okay guys foreign hey folks quick reminders again I don't think you need them but I'm going to give them to you anyway you're going to turn in your evaluation feedback try to get it in by Friday Friday night even Saturday morning I want to get it out of the way and this weekend because as you well know on Monday you have your quiz in fact all three of my classes of quizzes on Monday which means that I know exactly what I'm going to be doing Monday night and Tuesday and it's not going to be returning valuation so I would like to get this out of the way before that load comes in so you know um do I look like I'm wearing sunglasses I just want to make sure I I made the mistake of picking the wrong pair of glasses up when I was in California last weekend and this is the one that automatically turns shades and I and I hate it because sometimes it doesn't know the difference between sunlight and fluorescent light and it starts to turn dark and I feel like a rock star who's had too much to drink who's trying to cover up uh so it's I'm not trying to cover up a hangover or red eyes I just picked up the wrong glasses so in case my glasses start to turn dark that's exactly what's happening okay so today we're do more valuation so again let me start with a couple of very simple questions but they're actually going to start a hole that's going to get much deeper now today we're going to talk about valuing Emerging Market companies and Emerging Market companies are not the only companies with bad corporate governance it's all over the world Facebook has bad corporate governance Google has bad for corporate governance but let's say you're valuing a company with bad corporate governance and let's say that the company is also badly managed remember if you have bad corporate governance and you're well managed you don't care right bad corporate governance and badly managed when you get it let's say it's badly managed and when you do your cash flows you bring in the fact that it's badly managed and badly right and you come up with a value of 100 million dollars should I be discounting this value for bad corporate governance why not and how do I know it's in the cash flows because I estimated the cash flows right so if you get to this point and you're not sure what you built into your cash flows you're far bigger products if you've already built in the fact that this company keeps growing with a six percent return on Capital even though it's costing capital is 10 you're effectively assuming that not only is bad management here for the next year the next two years it's here to stay I mean when you get to the terminal value we talked about what happens never return on Capital equal to the cost of capital your growth ceases to matter right we return capitals higher than the cost of Capital Growth increases value can you have a company that in terminal value earns a return on Capital less than the cost of capital yes in which case you will get the terminal value that's lower than your book value and if you could change the way the companies run you would but with terrible corporate governance because it's a family control company or a in the inside his own shares you might have nothing you can do so we're going to talk about where because people never believe you say it's already in there so I want to give you a very simple mechanism for extracting how much of a discount you've already applied on it you know when you might want to apply a Discounter is you assume everything moves to Industry averages I give you that choice to hang yourself right because the industrial average is right there so you move the margins the industry average the cost of capital comes on implicitly you're telling me a story that this company is badly managed it's going to find a way to fix itself and if you're valuing a company with corporate governance is terrible you might want to rethink that assumption and say maybe not everything is going to move to the industry average because this company is just badly run and there's nothing I can do to change it because the other thing we're going to do today is we're going to Value distress companies now of course the class is under stress but the focus on the bonds and the stress right let's say you're investing the equity of a distress company and you learned every lesson that you need to learn about projecting cash flows so you make realistic assumptions about the expected cash flows you take Bed Bath and Beyond let's take a company on the edge of the of the of the cliff you project our expected cash flows you bring the revenues down because you don't think the revenues will grow you stabilize their margins over time but at a lower level you attach a discount rate that reflects a high cost of debt and a high cost of equity you know and you come up with the present value you've done everything right you've done discounted cash flow valuation the way you're trained to do it you come up with a value for the company what does distress mean that there is a chance this company will not make it right will the value you get from a discounted cash flow valuation for a distressed company get the value right maybe it's already in there like it was for corporate governance will it be too low or too high anybody want to give that a shot and tell me why what is it about discounted because we did everything we're doing rational right what is it that's the discount cash flow valuation is not capturing the risk so remember we talked about truncation risk when you do a discounted cash flow evaluation whether you like it or not you're valuing your company as a going concern and if there's a chance that that will not happen you have to explicitly bring it in and you know the pushback you're going to get is right why don't I just put it into the discount rate it's not going to work discount rates are meant to capture operating risk you can look at cost of capital for really distressed companies they're not a thousand percent which is what they should be the day before you go bankrupt or liquidate that'd be at 15 16 18 they're blunt instruments they were never designed to capture this kind of risk So today we're going to talk about how you estimate that failure risk at distress companies it's easier to do than with startups we have the ammunition to do it and then you have to ask a follow-up question what exactly will My Equity be worth if that happens so both big questions because our questions I think we deal with badly in intrinsic valuation but questions will come back to so let's go back to where we were in the slides I'd finish my my Amazon valuation in 2000. remind me again what I found I value the company at remember I actually value to 35 the market valued it at 84. I found it significantly over that January 2000 peak of the.com book one year later aimr came back to me and said would you do another webcast on.com companies but the frame of reference had completely changed because in that intervening year think of what had happened the.com boom it bust the economy that was never supposed to go into recession again was in a recession risk premiums had risen the world had changed so I Revisited my valuation of Amazon in 2001. then I got more pessimistic that story I told became a little smaller because I said the pathway to glory is not going to be as easy as it is I brought in a failure risk now which I hadn't done in 2000 because I learned my lesson from 2000. and the value that I got for per share was about twenty dollars per share and I remember finishing the valuation and somebody in the audience said aren't you uncomfortable that your value changed so much in a year and my response was after a year like last year I'd be uncomfortable if my value didn't change at least this much but you can see why the question comes about right for whatever reason we're taught that intrinsic value can't change you've done everything right why would it change because the world changes around you and if you think I've changed my mind going from 35 to 20 how do you characterize what the market has done it went from 84 down to eleven dollars and now I was trapped let me explain what I mean by track remember a year ago after I finished the valuation what do you ask me are you selling short and then at this little song and dance about time Horizon and I can't do it and you let me escape now I'm trapped because now what's the question you're gonna ask me are you buying it now I have no escape hatch I bought Amazon for the first time in January 2001. he's saying what do you mean for the first time when you invest in some think of how many books there are on when to buy stocks think of how few books there are on when to sell them because it's almost as implicit wisdom that once you buy it it's leave it in your portfolio for the rest of Eternity but that statement is inconsistent with the notion of value investing right because the investing value investing is you buy something when it's undervalued what's the flip side of that you hold it until it becomes overvalued you need to sell it every investment in my portfolio I have to do a maintenance valuation at least once a year sometimes more because if something big happens I've got to go back and revisit it I did my maintenance valuation in 2002. my value actually increased significantly over the course of the year because the immediate threat of failure had gone away my value went up the price also went up but the stock stayed undervalued basically Amazon has earned the right to stay in my portfolio the next year 2003 it's a great year for value my value almost doubled but the price tripled I mean this is my story my valuation my actions have to be consistent and I said it's time to leave it's a good journey but no I bought Amazon four times in the last 20 years I've sold Amazon three times in the last 20 years I kind of get that kind of gives away where I'm with Amazon right now but essentially this notion of never I mean IO people say I will never buy snowflake I will never how can you say never at the right price you should be willing to buy anything and right now when you finish your valuation you might say I think this stock is overvalued today I would not buy it today but don't follow up and say I'll never buy this stock because who knows what the next year will bring and where that price will be a year from now so my Amazon valuations I've done pretty much every year from 1997 through 2022 my most recent one that is public is the February 2022 evaluation of all of the fangam stocks you can take a look at how much the numbers have changed now one of the things I also did in 2014 when I was updating my 2014 valuations I did something that I usually don't do because it kind of depresses you to see how wrong you are in your forecast 2014 I went and looked at what the actual revenues for Amazon were remember in 2009 I forecast doubt the revenues in year one two three with that compounded Revenue growth of 42 percent a year if you take to 2010 which would have been your 10 I was projecting revenues of 41 billion they actually came in lower but in the years after you can see they took off so in 2010 if I'd stop I actually was much too optimistic about Amazon what I missed was they got a second wind after two it's almost like they were moving towards steady state as a large retail company and they said you know what that's not what we want to be I'll talk about the story shift in Amazon but actually under Revenue growth if you pull it out to 2014 I'm on the shooting there actually if you look at your 2014 my revenue forecast was 51.5 billion because I saw them become the sixth largest retailer their actual revenues were 85 . so in that part of the story I earned a short but take a look at my margins those are my projected margins for Amazon there are the actual margins again as you go towards 2010 it looks like they're moving in the right direction right they're maturing the margins are improving and then all of a sudden they seem to be going in the other direction you can read in one of two ways you can say you know Amazon is going backwards or we could say maybe they're changing from what I thought they were which is an online retail firm to something else in 2012 when I valued Amazon for the first time in my evaluations of Amazon I stopped in my story describing it as an online retail company I described it as a disruption platform because that's what they started doing in 2010 they said hey what we did in retail we can replicate in logistics we can replicate in you know in grocery retail we can replicate in food delivery they essentially they were reframing their story saying we can go after any business with soft spots because we're going to go after them so I I'll show you my my valuation from click the page if you go to my February 2020 to 22 evaluation you're going to see that disruption platform tell me the upside of becoming a disruption platform what does it do to your story what's your total Market of your retail companies retailing If You're A disruption platform it could be everything your upside is you could have two trillion in revenues if you're in 10 different business that's the outside the downside is it's a lot of distraction along the way right and Amazon for the most part has balanced the two but in the last couple of years I think the distractions are starting to get in the way you can blame Andy jassy for it because he's now the CEO but the reality is when you're in the logistics business the retail business the healthcare business and you decide to add business after business somewhere along the way you might end up becoming less effective at these businesses but to show you how much Amazon is viewed as a threat across businesses about six years ago I saw a survey of the CEOs of the 50 largest market cap companies in the world they're very diverse companies and I'm going to go through the list of companies and you tell me whether this company thinks about Amazon Walmart Amazon lives in Walmart's head I don't think there's even Walmart in Walmart's head it's all about what would Amazon do we've got to do it differently or do it the same so clearly Walmart it dominates it what about FedEx we think FedEx thinks about Amazon if you think about logistics business clearly Amazon's footprint is almost as big or even bigger than the footprint of either FedEx or UPS or the US Postal Service now but to show you businesses that you don't normally think of as being threatened they asked Jamie Diamond to list out so each of these companies the CEO has asked to list are the five companies that they were most worried about in terms of of competition going forward and Jamie dimon at JPMorgan Chase one of the companies listed was Amazon he said why would JPMorgan Chase be afraid of Amazon does banking have a lot of soft spots I remember when I moved from the east coast to the West Coast I moved from a JPMorgan Chase Bank in New Jersey to a JP Morgan Chase Bank I'm moving my money the same bank from one branch to another Branch it should be effortless right they charged me a 45 fee and I said like what exactly did you do take all the cash out of my account put on the back of somebody make them walk across the country it's simply absurd it's just pure we can do it because what choice do you have it pissed me off and it's building up I'm waiting for that email to come from Amazon Bank saying we're thinking of starting a bank would you be interested I mean would you want service at your bank to look like the service you get on Amazon Prime I would you don't like that Costco return it there's a drop-off box no I one of the things that helps me on stories is to visualize the story when I think of Amazon you know who I see I see Thanos from The Avengers yeah because when Amazon enters a business here's one thing we don't know whether they'll ever make money but here's the other thing we know that business is going to be less profitable from this day on the day that Amazon bought Whole Foods the collective market cap of grocery stores dropped by 50 billion dollars the day Amazon decide to enter online retailing in Chile Chilean retailers lost 25 percent of their market cap because people know that the economics of that business have been shaken up so I tell CEOs if you have a moment of prayer get down on your knees look up to the Stars say please God don't let Amazon enter my business because nothing good they might lose money but you're definitely not going to be better off after then with Netflix you know what comes to mind a hamster on a wheel that's what I see when I see Netflix because I mean think about the Netflix model throw 100 new shows up every day 95 of them are unwatchable I was in um I was in a podcast yesterday and the person for whatever reason asked me what I was watching on streaming and I said the one thing I've stopped doing is looking for something on Netflix because I have more false starts on Netflix than on any other streaming you know what I've thought you start a show and 10 minutes in you say I don't have the time in my life to waste on this I started that show Money Heist if you're Spanish you should banish this show forever because it makes everybody in Spain look stupid you have stupid you know basically every person in that show you gotta say how stupid can be the policemen are stupid the hostage takers are stupid the hostages are stupid and after about 30 minutes they're saying this is killing my brain cells just watching this show but Netflix has no way to get off this this wheel right because they've trained people you open up Netflix there's no new shows what's going on only 10 new shows that'll be at least 50 for me to be interested hamster run away so I want you to think I would have a storytelling for a company think about a character from a movie or a character from a cartoon say you know that's that's you know the road runners what I see whenever I see this company if you've never seen the Road Runner you should see Wiley Coyote in the Road Runner may be Wiley Coyote is what you see it's offer Cliffs smash at the bottom over and over again maybe that's credit Suites right they Wylie Coyote from the roadrunner so with that long lead and let's now talk about mature company so young growth companies any questions in general some of you are well in young growth companies it's not easy you're going to make lots of mistakes you're going to say this is incredibly difficult to do but remember you're not alone everyone valued this company including the people running the company face exactly the same uncertainties you do let's not talk about mature companies what makes mature companies easy to value usually you have a lot of history right they're set in their ways may ask your follow-up question can you get set in ways that are not good for you forget about companies do you do things every day sir should not do that but yes so used to doing that that you you keep doing it companies get into bad habits the mature companies that are doing things that shouldn't be doing it's creating value destruction and finally somebody draws their attention to it you shouldn't be doing it and who's usually that person it's usually not somebody in the company somebody from outside a call I can a Bill Ackman that doesn't make any sense why do you guys keep opening stores if nobody's coming into your stores now initially of course the company says no no where's you no we're going to continue to do what we do but now you have two Pathways for the company one is the pathway the status quo which is to keep doing what you're doing the other is this modified pathway maybe you change the way the companies run and that's going to create problems and valuation because each pathway is going to lead to different inputs for the company so let's take the four questions what are your cash flows from existing assets sorry where am I in this what are my cash flows from existing assets with the status score you might get one number because you know and with the changes where you sell off three businesses you might get a different number and ask you what's your value from future growth with the status score you get one set of answers and one value but with somebody else running the company in a different way of running the company you might get a lower reinvestment rate and a higher return on capital or a higher reinvestment rate and lower return Capital depending on what you think is a better way of doing it how risky are you again with the status call you might get one number because there are eight businesses but maybe what you're going to do is do what Alibaba does and break up into six different businesses and maybe that'll give you a different risk profiling a different cost of capital every question you now get two answers if you try to bring them all into one valuation it's going to be a mess right because you have two different ways of running the company leading to two different values do the right thing nothing in valuation says you have got to fit everything into one DC app Nothing Stops you from valuing the company more than once so I'm going to give you an example it's a company that some of you might have heard of but even if you haven't heard of the company you probably have heard of the most famous product it's a company called Hormel Foods it's an old company it's been around a long time and it produces a product that I think is the single most odious thing I've ever seen sold as a food product it's called span if you're a spam spam is this slimy looking ham in a can there is a life that will last beyond a nuclear winter for the rest of Eternity how the heck you make meat last forever I don't know I don't want to know but you know how spam was created does anybody know the story of how Hormel came up with Spam after the second world war the US Army was trying to get its soldiers back from the Far East and getting from the from Asia back to the US none of the U.S aircraft could make that flight so they had to stop in the middle so what's between Japan and the US what's right in the middle there lots of ocean but there's Hawaii so the land in Hawaii and this is not the Hawaii of today with five-star hotels this is a Hawaii of 1945. you have tens of thousands of hungry soldiers Landing they don't want pineapple to eat they want meat so the US Army puts out a requisition we want meat and we want meat that we we can use without having to store in a refrigerator we don't have enough Refrigeration space and Hormel came up with Spam which is one reason if you go to Hawaii now you can actually get cookbooks with Spam everything you can make it spam casserole Kung Paul spam I mean you name it it's you can make it with Spam it tastes terrible no matter how you make it but that's a kind of product Hormel Foods that's lots of names that people recognize here Hormel chili Hormel beans you walk down the grocery store they've been around forever mature company but a very conservatively run company it used to be a family control company but the family it's all the families kind of moved on and now it's run by managers but it's run conservative what's that the company refuses to borrow money to borrows very little why because they don't like to borrow money they think the world ends on the the U.S cost that basically they they don't believe the rest of the world existed no Global dreams so they reinvest very little the reinvestment rate is is about if you look at if if you look at their reinvestment rate for the most recent year the reinvestment rate is about 14 so they reinvest very little they grow at a low rate they use very little debt and they're set in their ways so initially that's what I did a valued Hormel food with their existing waste low growth a higher cost of capital than they should have and I came up with the value per share by 32 dollars could Hormel Foods be run more aggressively yes what would that mean I'm not going to go crazy and give them a 30 growth rate but they could reinvest more let's say 40 percent of their after tax operating income that reinvestment rate a higher reinvestment rate I'm going to be realistic this might mean taking projects with lower returns than they used to and I'm okay with it it's still higher than the cost of capital so the 2.75 growth becomes a 5.6 growth rate so I'm not again making them into a high growth company but I'm pushing for more growth some of that has to come from outside the U.S and on the cost of capital they use only about 10 percent debt and 90 equity they could borrow a lot more how much more I'm going to take you to the process and if you've been in my corporate finance class as a very simple process for figuring out the right mix of debt and equity and in this case for Hormel Foods I think they can go up to about a 40 debt ratio which lowers their I'm sorry 20 debt ratio which lowers the cost of capital to about six and I'm being conservative at 20 they could probably push to 30 or even 40 but I don't want to put the company into distress so I'm making small incremental changes slightly more debt more reinvestment higher growth I'll revalue the company thirty eight dollars we've got two values for the company right thirty two dollars with a status score 38 dollars with changes per day I'm an investor I can buy only at One price I said the stock price is 34 right now and so what do I do 38 is higher than 34 32 is slower well both the status quo and the changes can't coexist there's got to be a probability of one happening or the other happening so I try to assess the likelihood of change coming to the company so what might be some of the things I would look at to make a judgment on How likely it is that change will come I looked at the top 17 shareholders and whose name would I love to see at the Top If I want change to come quickly I'd like to see a call I can a Bill Ackman an activist investor right not there the largest investor in the company was an entity called the Hormel Foundation you're saying what's a Hormel Foundation it's a Hormel family remember they used to run the company they've all gone on they live leisurely lives but the shares they own is held by the Hormel foundation around 27 of shares so if you can get the Hormel foundation on your side change is going to come right so I took a look at who headed the Hormel Foundation maybe I could get an ally you know who the head of the Hormel Foundation was the CEO of Hormel now this is going to make my life a lot more difficult to get change going so I got realistic I said look there's no 50 chance of change it's probably going to be 10 why even 10 because Hershey's used to be structured exactly the same way and eventually they had to change because the board of directors recognize that by staying the way they were they were undercutting their end game they have this they're the foundation at this charitable you know things that they did and they weren't able to do the things so I'm going to attach a 10 chance to change in the 90 chance to no change and my expected value is 32.50 when you have change coming and it's going to be discrete it's going to create different outcomes bringing in no instead of trying to put it all into one valuation no create valuations under each scenario next week's uh valuation of the week now even though you might not be looking at it take a look at it is it going to be evaluation of EasyJet that I did in 2019. EasyJet of course is a UK discount Airline whose revenues come from flying you know people to holiday destinations in Europe you think so what 2009 was Peak uncertainty about brexit and it had huge consequences for EasyJet because if if there was a hard brexit there was a very real chance that the EU would say you can't even fly into the EU area because you know there are certain requirements they'd have had to move their headquarters from the UK to somewhere in Europe to continue to do what they did so I actually valued it with three different scenarios hard brexit soft brexit no brexit gave up at three very different values and then I detached properties you're not evading that responsibility but when you have a company that's subject to a big regulatory change that might or might not come rather than say which one is going to happen try to put it all into one valuation do two valuations and deal with the probabilities of each one happening later so mature companies for the most part are easy to Value but that doesn't mean they're a slam dunk so let me talk a little bit about debt ratios because you know as you can see the the no I used a higher debt ratio and of course you know when you talk to analysts they always seem to believe that using more debt will always lower your cost of capital that's a myth it's an easy myth to disprove in fact if you want to think about what will happen to my cost to capitalize my debt ratio changes here's the one thing you cannot do you cannot keep your cost of equity in your cost of debt fixed and just change the ratios because if you do that you know exactly what's going to happen right the cost of equity is much higher than the cost of debt if I just change the mixes at a 99.99 debt my cost of capital is going to be lowest which is nonsensical the reason it doesn't make sense is as my debt ratio changes both my cost of equity and my cost of debt will change intuitively you can see why regular Equity investor in a company and I double my debt I made your Equity earnings more risky and you should demand a higher cost of equity and we actually created a mechanism to do that right so when we talked about betas rather than take a regression beta what did I say we should do take a bottom-up beta level it up using your debt to equity ratio so what you see here is my beta for Hormel Foods at different debt ratios from zero to ninety percent that and not surprisingly as my debt ratio climbs my Beta climbs as my Beta climbs my cost of equity goes up your cost of equity will always go up as your debt ratio goes up there's no escaping it no matter what type of company turn to the cost of that usually we get a cost to debt looking at a rating right but that's static it looks the existing deterioration the existing grade consider a little experiment let's take the company you're valuing and let's say it doubles its debt do you think it's rating will change you double your debt the ratings agency is going to freak out they're going to revisit your rating and they're going to come up with a new rate you're saying how the heck am I going to estimate it remember how we estimated the cost of debt for companies without ratings what's the ratio we used interest coverage ratio operating income divided by interest expect so here's what I do at every debt ratio I compute your interest expense and compute and interest coverage ratio not rocket science but as my interest coverage ratio changes I compute a synthetic rating and guess what as Hormel food seeps borrowing money its rating is going to slide and eventually become diff no no single C Double C based on how high my debt ratio goes my cost of equity changes my cost in fact both go up cost of equity and cost debt but here's the trade-off debt is cheaper than equity so I'm replacing more expensive Equity with cheaper debt but I'm pushing up both at the same time the net effect shows up in my cost of capital and what you see at home health foods is something you're going to see at most companies initially as you borrow money my costly Capital decreases seven 6.8 6.59 6.57 and around 30 percent you start to see the B Stern that is the other I mean if you think of that as a double-edged sword the sharp edge is now towards you and you can see the cost to Capital start to go up on a pure optimization basis the cost of capital that will maximize the value for male Foods is about 30 percent debt you're saying why did you stop for 20. if you want to make a mistake it's better to undershoot than to overshoot and leverage so I've kind of given them a buffer here so they can't accuse me of pushing them beyond the limit but this is a simple way in which you can stop and ask a question about your company how much can my company borrow what is the right mix of debt and Equity incidentally we go to my corporate to my spreadsheet section I have an OP capital structure optimization spreadsheet that we use in the corporate finance class you're welcome to download it put the numbers for your company there's like nine numbers I asked for it does this whole table for you because it's not rocket science it's very mechanical and it's designed to ask a question what's the right mix of debt and equity for my company so any questions on which your companies so we talked about growth companies we've talked about mature in terms of the life cycle what's left let's talk about the most depressing part of the life cycle let's talk about declining companies part of the reason we have trouble with declining companies is psychological and explain what I mean by that it takes a frame of mind that most of us don't feel comfortable adopting part of it comes with all the pain that comes with decline but what does decline mean when I look at your past when I ask you what are your cash flow some existing assets can you show me a history if it's a declining company you know what I see right the revenues are sliding down over time for whatever reason your margins are under pressure take a look at Bed Bath and Beyond's revenues over time now you're going to see the revenues come down margins are shrinking when I ask you the value of growth you look at me like I have two heads he said what value of growth that was 10 years ago 20 years ago now you're talking about shrinking so what you're thinking about your objective is not to reinvest more and grow but actually shrink your company and take assets out shut down stores if you're Bed Bath and Beyond when you think about why risk might change as you change as a company and you shrink depends on what parts of the company you're shutting down and selling off and what you do with the cash see why that matters if you're Bed Bath and Beyond you shut down stores you take the cash and use it to buy back stock you're almost asking to go bankrupt right because the debt is still there if you take that cash and pay down debt maybe you could become a safer and smaller company and finally when I ask you when will the good times begin your answer is there are no good times at this point you have to stop and here you might consider the possibility that assuming that your company will grow at a constant rate forever might not be the right assumption because it doesn't deliver the higher value so what do you do it set at the end of year five or ten you take liquidation value you take what you can get out I mean let's admit it with Bed Bath and Beyond that might be your optimistic view of the company because I don't see an end game where people keep coming into Bed Bath and Beyond stores the rest of it already they're not coming now why would they come for the rest of Eternity so let's start with the psychological part you're all valued companies don't say you don't act surprised you are valuing companies whether you know it or not and you're supposed to turn it in how many of you using are using a negative Revenue growth there or estimating a negative Revenue growth rate for your company you are what company are you doing eyes are here and that's good then because in a sense this is a question I asked for almost every DCF audience I have people who do valuation every day they've done it for 40 years you know how many people have been valuing companies for decades and have never used a negative Revenue growth rate and that should strike you as strange because do some companies shrink yeah how come you never run into these companies or maybe you do and psychologically are unable to put a minus number in this it just makes you feel unwashed no I don't I can't do that it's not natural that's the psychological part putting in a negative Revenue growth rate making margins smaller seems almost we're not wired for that as human beings we're wired to be optimistic so that's the first thing getting over that psychological limit of saying okay I can put in a negative Revenue growth rate it's okay you're running a tobacco company you know what negative Revenue growth rate might be the best estimate to put for the company doesn't make it a bad company or a bad investment it just means your core business is shrinking fossil fuel companies especially if you believe that climate change is going to bring significant change to business you value excellent mobile a minus three percent growth rate might not be a bad assumption so I'm going to show you what happens but the worst case scenario here is you have a company in Decline and you value it the realistic thing for the right thing for this company to do is actually shrink revenues and reduce margins but you have Management in denial you know what I mean by that often when you have a declining company what do they do they hire a new CEO and they tell the CEO make us great again this is asking for disaster because you know what this is this is like being in a casino and you're going to put everything on number 23 and if it pays off you're the Superstar CEO for the rest of an eternity if it doesn't you say it wasn't my fault Marissa Meyer spent five billion dollars trying to make people use Yahoo again five billion dollars it went down the drain but it's not her fault she was given this Mission rescue the company sometimes any value declining company you gotta look at who's on top of the company and if it's a person with a lot of ambition you don't want a Visionary running a declining company trust me I mean that's a recipe for you don't want Steve Jobs running Bed Bath and Beyond uh yoga to drive the company into the drain and invest billions of dollars trying to do something you cannot do so when you look at declining companies you got to factor in who's running the company so I'm going to take you back in times of evaluation I did of JCPenney and this is right after they'd hired somebody from Apple to run JCPenney you could see how people see God's success right Marissa Meyer where did she come from where did uh Yahoo fine she was I think number set the number seven employee at Google so she'd actually grown and succeeded at Google so you picked these companies which have great growth and you say maybe I can live in reflected Glory so JCPenney had hired the guy in charge of Apple Stores and Apple stores that succeeded coming to JCPenney and make us shiny and valuable again I took one look at this have you ever been to a JCPenney store how do you make this shiny and valuable right you could make it less unattractive and perhaps somebody might even come in so when I value the company I was distinct I thought I was being this was an optimistic valuation of the company I put in a minus three percent growth rate for the next six years what am I effectively doing I'm assuming that JCPenney is shutting down its most expensive stores so if JCPenney has a store in New York City my advice is get out of there you don't want that expensive lease and going back to a core business and I'm making the assumption that there is a core JCPenney business that that will still survive Maybe I'm Wrong on that but maybe if they go to just into suburban and rural areas and cater to an older population maybe half the stores they can survive that's basically what I'm doing I'm shrinking the company making it smaller and while it's shrinking see this reinvestment number it's negative you're saying what does that mean you're shutting stores down you're getting out of leases and the lessors are actually paying you to leave so rather than putting money into the business you're taking money out of the business you invested Capital shrinks the company shrinks you're basically making a company smaller the optimistic side here is when you get to year 10 I'm assuming they've hit some steady state a smaller company that can now grow with the economy or with inflation that's giving me my terminal value and the value per share that I got with that assumption put in was about 4.8 billion dollars but I had to be realistic this is a declining company it has a lot of debt and leases and things could go bad a recession would push them over so I attached a 20 chance of failure based on what their actual rating was as a company this is the advantage of working with declining companies is unlike startups so you don't have an external measure of default risk here your moodies and s p rating the company that twenty percent of the time you know what I assume My Equity would be worth nothing how much am I going to get back liquidating all my other stores all the inventory 50 off 80 off maybe I'm being unrealistic but basically you know you look at the value that I'm getting it's half of what my fair value is the value that I get for the operating assets is a weighted average or what I get for the company with success or going concern and a 20 chance of failure I'm opening the door to how to deal with distress rather than try to bring it into the discount rate you're going to estimate a failure probability and attach how much the equity will be worth with that failure and take an expected back so let me use a slightly more elaborate example of how to estimate that failure rate at distressed companies does everybody accept the proposition though if you do a traditional DCF and you do it right for a distressed company you're going to Value it as a going concern but that's going to be too high a number given the chance your company will not make the key issue then becomes how do I estimate the likelihood that my company will fail and I'll give you three ways of doing it and then how do I incorporate what will happen to my equity in case that happens so one is what I did with uh with with JCPenney estimate the property failures to look at the bond rating and Trust the ratings agencies and basically the way you trust the ratings agencies you go back in history and say if I have a double B rating what is the likelihood that the company will fail given the history of Double B rated bonds 18.3 gives you false Precision because you're getting that second decimal point but you're using the history of defaulted boards but if you have traded bonds I'm going to give you another way in which you can estimate probability of default that you might or might not like but it's actually a fun way to think about how you can use the bond market to estimate a chance that your company will not make because let's face it stock investors and Equity markets are easy to distract you hold up shiny objects you know oh my God that look at the growth Bond investors you got to give them credit or single-minded what's the only thing they care about will I get paid will I get paid will I get paid you show them growth I don't care will I get paid and that gives them I think an advantage when it comes to things like distress because they could look at will my interest payments get made so I'm going to use the bond price to back it out and if you have neither a rating or a bond price I'm going to suggest a statistical technique that you might be able to use to estimate a property of default so here's the company I'm going to use as my example it's a company called Las Vegas sets heard of it Las Vegas stands a casino company and casino companies have this strange phenomenon they tend to be run by megalomaniac narcissists I mean this might be a generalization but they're all run by Caesars so you had you know you had to if you look at when you know when casinos you know who Ranch uh Las Vegas cents until a few a little bit three years ago when he passed away guy called Sheldon address the Sheldon Adelson no he owed 52 percent of Las Vegas handset control and the two things that megalomaniacs care a great deal about a control and making money control comes first making money off in a secondary time there's a reason I'm bringing that into the story Las Vegas Sands was one of the fastest growing Casino companies between 2000 and 2007 about the casinos in Vegas casinos in Macau in Singapore there is this you know this gigantic hotel that shape was shaped like a ship yeah so it's all over the world and if you've ever driven by a Vegas casino it's a huge infrastructure investment and I remember getting lost in the Bellagio and I had to go to a present I had to do a presentation this to show you how big the Bellagio is it has 28 restaurants in the hotel God help you if you start walking in the wrong direction because it'd be two miles back to where you want to be so these are hundreds of millions of dollars each one now there are two ways you could raise money to fund these big infrastructure investment trades you can borrow money or you can issue shares guess which one Las Vegas Sands chose to employ and it's not uncommon you know Casino companies do this all the time almost entirely that why because when you own 52 of the shares you're terrified that if your issue shares to build these casinos you'd lose control so they borrowed money they built a casino borrowed more money built another casino but they were successful and when times were good there was actually one of the high most highly recommended Casino stocks on Wall Street it's 2007. then 2008 hits the bottom Falls up into two Dimensions one is the economy goes into recession fewer people are coming to casinos your revenues and earnings are suffering the second is all that debt you'd accumulated that people did not notice before people start to notice now so this was a valuation I did of Las Vegas Sands in February 2009 when rumors were circulating and they were very wide that Las Vegas Sands would not make it through the next six months will they make their interest payments so those rumors are swirling around I put them to the side and I sat down and I did what I I did a textbook version of how you fix a trouble company maybe it's an old textbook but still a textbook question what do you do to fix a trouble company you bring the revenues back you improve the margins you lower the debt ratio all in a spreadsheet I fixed the company I made it a nice healthy company I give it a big terminal value I come up with a value per share of eight dollars and 12 cents so this is built on the presumption that my margins improve over time as the economy comes back that my debt ratio goes down over time as the company becomes healthier I've essentially fixed the company in my spreadsheet made into a going concern given it terminal value and valued the share at eight dollars and 12 cents stock was trading at four dollars and 25 cents ask me the question what's the question you ask when you deceive anybody did I buy and I said no I'm not interested which led to some soul-searching right because the value is 812 according to my intrinsic value you know what was holding me back right all those rumors about how this this eight dollars and twelve cents is the value of the company if it makes it as a going concern what am I concerned about that might not be the case so I wanted to estimate the likelihood of failure and I'll show you how I use the bond price Las Vegas stands at bonds outstanding it is a seven year bond outstanding with uh it was rated B plus so I could have used the rating to come up with the probability but I wanted to see if I could use the bond market to get a more finesse number seven year bond with a coupon rate of 6.375 percent it was trading at 529 remember bonds are face value of a thousand so if you're trading at 529 you're trading at a huge discount on face value now normally the way you price a bond is you take the coupons and you discount them back at this default risk adjusted discount ready to come up with the present value I set it up slightly differently I took the price of the bond I took the promise coupons remember these are promised coupons based on the bond features and then I said look those coupons will get delivered only if the company is around to pay them so I multiplied each one by one minus the probability the company would fail of course right now I don't know what that number is and because I've adjusted the coupons for the likelihood that I would get paid guess what I discount those coupons back I discount those expected coupons back at the risk Trader so basically instead of taking the promise coupons and discounting them back at a risk adjust rate I'm making the promise coupons and expected coupons trust me it's going somewhere so if the price of the bond at the coupon and the face value I have the risk-free rate what's the only number I don't have the probability of distress I used to solve a function in Excel said tell me what that number is and it came back with 13.54 you're saying what is that telling that the chance of failure is 13 and a half percent a year based on the pricing of the body a teacher I need to survive 10 years to get to Nirvana to get to the terminal value so if there's a 13 and a half percent chance of failure Reacher guess what the likelihood is that I'll make it to your 10. it's about 23 percent there's a 23 chance that my company will be going concerned it's worth eight dollars and 12 cents the remaining 77 percent of the time tell me what's going to happen it's going to falter on its bonds fail to pay then it's got to sell the casinos to whom other Casino companies are equally in trouble they don't have the money to do it you're not going to get face value and then you're going to pay off all the debt there's zero chance My Equity is ever coming back to me if that happens so My Equity is going to be what zero so I have two values eight dollars and 12 cents Las Vegas cents as a going concern zero is my bad if it doesn't 77 chance of that my expected value is a dollar ninety two and that's I think the best way to think about this Trends is you got to really worry about that property of failure what are the things that could move it remember anytime a company goes into distress that are restructuring talks you're watching those like a hawk because the outcome from those talks can vary quickly alter those probabilities a little later in this class we're going to talk about buying Equity deeply distressed companies as options and why you might do it here you're still treating it as a going concern and say what's that Equity worth any questions on distressed companies yes there's a risk of failure so the first part of what you said what is the risk of failure is what okay so you say I computed a compounded annual average and you're saying it's a 13.5 percent every year why not have 40 in year one third so usually failure risk is greatest in the near term it drops off it will if you wanted to you could actually bring it in because ultimately the big cash flow is determined value right so playing with the intermediate years is not going to alter value that much so that's why I just took the compounded average if you have big cash flows that are new due in the near term and that's what you're building on then you might build in a term structure for failure rates you can actually do it because all I need to do is find a one-year Bond a two-year Bond a three-year Bond and do exactly what I did with the seven year bond and I'll get property of fail in year one in year two in year three and attach that to each Year's cash flow and that'll give me a more refined value if I wanted to because I am doing a bludgeon approach here we're taking expected value failure rate today what's My Equity worth but you could actually carry it out over time yes and it is but when you do the market value of debt using the default risk what are we effectively doing we're taking the promised interest payments we're acting like we make the payment right so if you look at at how we get that that cost debt implicit in the cost of debt is if I'm I'm going to make the promise payments as much more risk so even though we're using a higher cost of debt for riskier companies we're still acting like we make the entire interest payment back so the presumption is I'm still going to survive I'm going to have a lot more angst about doing it but I'm going to pull it off and that's I think part of the problem is discounted cash flow evaluation as it was designed was designed for companies the chance of failure was so low you could ignore it the 1970s 1980s that might have been true the kinds of companies being valued but if you're starting to Value distressed companies and companies a chance of failures High I would do it only for companies which were below investment grade I don't want to do this with triple B single a because the chance of failure is small enough that I can I can bring it in somewhere but as the failure risk gets higher and higher you almost have to separate it from the valuation otherwise it'll throw everything off let's talk about valuing Emerging Market companies again let's go through the questions what are your cash flows and existing assets what do you do you look at the financial statements of the Emerging Market company now I know people complain about the quality of accounting but I remember how Divergent Accounting Standards used to be 40 years ago you live in a world where there's far more convergence than Divergence even countries don't have IFR as I'm moving towards IFRS it's true that there can be fraud and there can be things held back but that's going to be an issue and I say what are your cash flow existing actually look at the financial statements you might have less faith in the cash flows you get for a Chinese company and saying I don't know how they're pretty opaque they have cross Holdings the same opacity will get in the way if they have holding structures you can't see where they're investing what they're investing it becomes more difficult every question in a sense using the same techniques but you're working with data that you feel less secure about and to top it all off of course you have the these holding company structures again not unique to just Emerging Markets but in many Emerging Markets it's more the rule than the exception family group companies and there are cross Holdings you got to deal with then inter intra company transactions you're much more at the mercy of the people running the company because they can move well there are so let's talk a little bit about country risk first which we've done before and then talk about corporate governance first when you think about country risk I want you to remember what we did with country risk we came up with country risk premiums but rather than use it as a bludgeon to beat up every company in an Emerging Market we ask the question where does this company get its Revenue the implication is you can have an Emerging Market company like Infosys or Tata consulting services or embryer which is in an Emerging Market but gets a bulk of its revenues in developed markets or you can have a developed Market company like Coca-Cola which gets a big chunk of its revenues from Emerging Markets so rather than think about the country of incorporation I said think about where you get your revenues and Country risk has to reflect I mean I I gave you two ways of dealing with country risk which is one is to do the weighted average of the equity risk premiums the different countries you're in or the exceptional case we have a single country and that's all you're focused on this is the Abra evaluation in 2004 I said pick the country you're most worried about and estimate a lab Lambda basically capturing how risky your company is on that country is dimension so that's the lesson I would like to take out of country second people freak out about currencies in fact one of the things I get asked frequently should I push up the discard rate because this current series the answer is for the most part no and here's why currency risk is real right but there are two Dimensions one is when people talk about currency risk they're talking about first devaluation and currencies and you got to separate out expected from unexpected when uh when you think about how we adjust it for inflation of a country with a nine percent inflation rate another country with a two percent inflation rate let's say Brazil is nine percent the U.S is two percent when you do expected exchange rates three out to dollars what do we do with discarded cash flow valuation we don't use today's exchange rate we take that and we depreciate it about seven percent here the difference in inflation rates so we bring devaluation the cash flow so if that's what you mean by current series that your currency can devalue we've already built it in if what you mean by currency risk is the devaluation can be greater or lesser than expected I'm not sure I should be bringing that into discount rates because I have investors around 50 different countries and when they look at their portfolios that risk for the most part should be diversifiable risk a BlackRock or a State Street or a Vanguard which as an international fund shouldn't even be thinking about currency risk at the broad perspective because when the dollar strengthened some of the companies are going to benefit some are going to be hard so for the for the most part be ready for that pushback because often people want to push up the discount rate of a of a company in in a country where currencies are volatile the country risk takes care of the risk premium the currency risk is basically flows through so just to show you that currency shouldn't matter take a company this is a 2017 or 2018 as well in the company it's company called Infosys Indian company Outsourcing company gets 90 plus of its revenues outside India I did a valuation of Infosys in rupees so as a matter of screen rate was premium came up with a value of 614 rupees per share a minute later I decided to revalue the entire company in US dollars not what changes first thing is Created from five to two percent so let's start with the good news when I use U.S dollars I have a lower cost of capital for Infosys than I do in rupees why not because of countries that's in both discount rates but because I've moved from a high inflation currency to a low inflation currency lower discount rate is good right and the discounted cash flow evaluation but I'm not done see these growth rates growth rates have a currency embedded in them as well that 12 and 5 growth rate DC in rupees reflect an Indian rupee inflation rate when I did the same growth rates in US dollars that inflation effect comes out I have a lower growth rate in U.S dollars than Indian rupees so I have a lower discount rate because of inflation a lower growth rate because of inflation you can see what's coming when I do my net present value or the present value of the cash flows the value that I got was 12.79 per share which converted at the prevailing exchange rate that day would have given me 614 rupees per share incredibly good news I know and if any of you are valuing a Russian company you're valuing a company in um in turkey and you're saying I'm getting tired of carrying a 25 inflation rate Through Time this basically says go pick a different currency do everything in that currency and as long as you're consistent the value per share you get should be the same in every currency so it gives you an out when you're dealing with the currency with extremely high inflation because High inflation currencies are a pain to work with in valuation we know what to do but that doesn't mean it gets comfortable finally corporate governance track and again I don't want to make it sound like Emerging Market company it's a bad corporate governance and developed Market companies of good corporate governance because that's not true corporate governance can be good or bad in every part of the world but it's true that because of the history of how companies developed in many of these Emerging Markets there's a bigger issue with corporate governance and people try to they worry about it should I have a higher discount rate for because of bad corporate governance what do I do should I discount the value and I think we kind of came up with the answer if you're doing the valuation you control how you estimate cash flows and discount trades you have a mechanism you can use to bring in the effect of bad corporate governance so I'm going to use an example this is a company called tube Investments it's a South Indian publicly traded company and a company that I've known all my life because you know it's a company where you know I I remember the oldest company coming to my house with our six seven eight years old and of course you know this it's a so I've seen the seen the company's history it's a few years ago when I was back in Chennai which is where I grew up the the the the the people the family group running the company called me you know said can you come in and talk to our top management because we think our company is severely underpressed it's trading at 101 rupees per share it should be trading it far more so I walked in they said okay I'll do an intrinsic valuation but I can't promise you that I'm going to confirm your biases so here's what I thought I found a company that was reinvesting like there was no tomorrow 112 percent huge amounts of reinvestment entering new projects new businesses you think this is good in fact the return on Capital was was about 9.2 that doesn't sound bad right but this was in India where the risk-free rate was 12 percent so they're growing and they're reinvesting but they're growing and reinvesting in bad businesses by putting that growth rate and normally when I have this with the U.S company with reasonable corporate governance you know what I'm going to do is as I move towards the terminal value I'm going to fix the problem I'm not going to let you keep investing at 9.2 percent of your cost of capital is 16.2 percent because somebody from the outside your shareholders an activist investor is going to put pressure on you to change here I did not do that I left them on this destructive path because and and I'll tell you why because they did not see a problem they said we're growing why when were you punishing growing is only half the game growing and creating values the other half they were growing but they were growing badly and destroying value but I left them doing that because there was zero chance of change in this company what does that do if you keep growing at let's say in this case I assume the growth rate of five percent deal forever and you keep reinvesting at 9.2 percent and uh with your cost of capital is 15 16 percent you're going to grow and you're going to get a terminal value but the terminal value is actually lower than it would have been if you didn't reinvest at all the value per share that I got was 62 rupees so I said you know what you might complain about the 102 rupees but Market's probably being part to upbeat in my view because you guys keep running the business the way it is it should be worth only 64 rupees so I offered them a chance of what would you do to increase value you know what the first reaction was we should reinvest more first true we're near the hole stop digging reinvesting more is only good in fact you know because I have this freshly I said let's try it what do you think 150 reinvestment rate they made that 150 now I actually used the 60 they said why didn't you make it 112 like it was last year the value per share went to 45 and after about the second or third try of increasing the reinvestment rate they realized wasn't happening if you want to increase value here the first thing you need to fix you either need to increase the return on capital or new Investments you see what if I can't do that stop you make this reinvestment rate zero in this example you know what's going to happen to value per share probably going to go to 125 rupees per share sometimes doing nothing is better than doing something in fact a lot of times you could argue doing nothing is better than doing something but this fixation on growth growth growth I think gets in the way of that because you've been told that no in fact you could argue that they can get out of business they should probably offer negative growth rate sell off businesses take that cash out and do something good with it so you can play with the numbers there in fact after they did that I took them through two phase I said look let's let's move the return on Capital 9.2 to 12.2 percent nine it's unrealistically expect to go to 16.2 percent that brings your value to about a hundred rupees per share if you can move the return all the way to 16 it goes up to 150 rupees per share have less focus on growing and more focus on the quality of that growth because that's really what's driving value and many mature companies with bad corporate governance that's what you worry about they get into a hole they can't stop digging and that's going to mean less value for you and of course cross Holdings we talked about how difficult and messy cross sortings are in fact as a warning on your next Quiz this is the one part I want you to go through the past problems and recognize when you add back when you it's a it's it's a it's a nightmare right sometimes you add sometimes you subtract but getting comfortable with it and with Emerging Market companies and again not just with them you have this issue in space because many of these companies have histories as family groups they're connected to each other in ways and whether you like it or not a chunk of the value comes so again staying with an Indian example I had to value four Tata companies for the Tata group one of India's oldest family groups and I value the companies I did an intrinsic valuation that's what you see in in the in the blue part of the ass that's my discounted cash flow value free cash for the firm discounted back at the cost of capital but then I had to adjust for cash and cross Holdings see the red part that's a cross holding component if you take Tata chemicals half of its value comes from its crossovertics and what do I know about them very little like the one company that is very little cross Holdings you start a Consulting Services you know why the youngest of the companies these cross Holdings are not a conspiracy to make your life difficult they're a reflection of these companies history 50 years ago Tata Motors needed to build a factory entire steel at excess cash you know what the family did they owned both companies they moved they were doing this because it was an internal Capital Market but the accounting for a basically meant that Tata steel now owned a piece of Tata Motors and the older you are as a company the more you're going to accumulate these cross Holdings but this red part is what makes me incredibly uncomfortable because I'm not sure what the value is the blue part I could say did I get the cash flows right did I get the risk right but that red part is going to always be messy to deal with finally truncation risk we talked about truncation risk from distress right but truncation risk can take lots of different forms I remember valuing an Egyptian Hotel company it was about 10 years ago no I don't even know why I was valuable but this is actually a hotel that then got Target in a terrorist attack and essentially demolished you say why don't they buy insurance you know how much Insurance costs I mean it's not always practical to insurance against some risks so when we talk about you know terrorism risks I mean that can affect the value of a company especially in countries with a completely exposed to it it could be natural disasters you invest in a company in the Caribbean it's again a tourism-based company one big hurricane goes through there goes your entire business model and finally of course if you're in a part of the world where the government gets pissed off at you they just take you over that's these are all truncation risks and what should you do with them exactly what you do with failure risk assess the likelihood of it happening and then ask what will I get if it happens I don't know several of the students from this class have gone on gone back to Venezuela they're on businesses and often I get calls from them successful businesses I'm doing really well so that's good I'm glad for you and say I'm scared and usually when you're doing well you're not scared and you're already scared of you know I'm doing so well that the government has started noticing me and I said that's not good and of course what they're talking about how do I bring in nationalization risk into my valuation the answer has to be you get whether you like it or not it's just a likelihood that will happen and then it says what will the government pay me it's not going to be fair value it might not even be Book value it might be nothing in some cases if that happens and take an expected value so I'm going to give a good example of how truncation risk plays out evaluation using a ramco and this is of course one of the valuations the week that you had in case you did see that valuation of the week you forget the repetition but when I valued around initially I valued as an oil business in fact it's one of the few valuations where I used to finite life to Value the company why because it's really not a company 300 million barrels of oil in the sand and once the oil is out there's nothing left so I put in a 50-year life came up with the present value of the cash flows I used to Dividend discount model freak it doesn't really matter whatever value you attach you come up with a value but 1.6 to 1.7 trillion dollars it was by by any means the most valuable IPO of all time because overnight the day it got went public it became the largest publicly traded company in terms of market cap because it actually had a market cap greater than Apple at that time so I did a traditional valuation and I finished the valuation I come up with the value probably 1.6 to 1.7 billion dollars but it's a traditional valuation right you take expected cash flows you discount back at a risk adjusted discount rate but when you buy a ramco you're not buying a typical company in fact I don't even know whether you're buying a company you're buying a country right it's Saudi Arabia Inc it's 80 percent of Saudi Arabia's GDP comes from aramco you're buying a country and it's not just a country you're buying a ruling family you're buying into the house of Saudi you're buying Saudi Arabia you see where I'm going this is a clear case where country risk is real and present it's in none of the numbers because how do I get the country risk from Saudi Arabia I look at the rating for the country and that doesn't reflect any of these worries so here's what I did and I have to tell you I'm I'm not good at political forecasting I said what is the chance of a regime change over the next 50 years I think I'm being pretty upbeat by assuming it's only 20 percent I mean look at how quickly Egypt turned from you know from a dictatorship to a you know to complete change you could have you know the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia it's 20 so what would happen if there's a regime change depends on who's the new regime is if it's Isis who knows what Saudi or what aramco could become well those cases you're not going to kill that lays the golden eggs it'll just mean that they'll charge a higher royalty tax now effectively it means you will not get what you thought you were going to get before the regime change attach the value of half of the existing bank and attached properties 80 percent times that the value of equity that I've estimated 20 times half that value assuming that royalties change my expected value then reflects the likelihood that the regime will change and how it will affect my value per share so if you're dealing with truncation risk and some of your companies you are the best way to do it is to actually separate it from and do two separate valuations you'll be telling two stories then for your company one with one regime one with the other one with one regulatory rule the other with you and take the expected value across the two and I think it's a more realistic way of dealing with this kind of risk at least get started on valuing bags I think I told you that pre-2008 I used to start my banking chapter with a statement that I've never been able to live down valuing Banks is easy because pre-2008 the way people valued Banks was at the dividend discount model we talk about why that is but the own it was the last Bastion for the dividend discount Market but 2008 in a sense changed the game because it showed us that Banks were not always run by sensible people so trusting them to pay the right amount of dividends might be dangerous and second the assumption that Banks could not get incredibly risky because The Regulators would prevent that from happening and it blew up as well so pre-2008 the reason we did that was asking and answering the question and evaluation were really difficult I asked you what are the cash flows you have from existing Assets in the back how do we get cash flows we start with earnings we add depreciation we subtract capex and subtract change try doing that for a bank you're very quickly go to Google banks are opaque we make a Faustian bargain when we invest in Banks the bargain is that we don't know much about it back when we when we invest in it but we're okay with it because somebody else is watching the risk that's a regulatory that's the bargain that for and it held for a long time from the end of the Great Depression through 2008 Banks were where people went for secure dividends and they really trusted that the system out so when you think about value Banks the reason they're difficult is because people would give up and they said let me use the dividend discount model and dividend discount models are the easiest valuation models because rather than forecast.capex and depreciation all you have to do is forecast net income forecast dividends as a percentage of net income there's a payout ratio and of course you have to be internally consistent still what does that mean as your growth rate decreases your payout ratio should go up so you again staying with the same principles but using the payout ratio as your metric so the valuation of Egyptian bank called CIB done entirely in Egyptian perhaps and of course the key number which I had trouble with the most was getting a risk free rate in Egyptian pounds and nobody remembered the way I got this risk free rate was I started with the USD bond rate and adjusted for differential inflation because there was no Government Bond out there but a high risk free rate in fact the cost of equity for the bank was 23 percent that's that's the bad news here's the good news the bank earned a return in equity of 42 it's a bank that has a solid business and a high inflation economy it passes the inflation through earns the return Equity 42 was reinvesting about 75 back so even though this looks terrible in terms of discount rate this bank has a growth rate that a U.S bank or european Bank couldn't even dream of having a 32 growth rate in it so it's a high growth bank with a low payout ratio in a currency with the risk free rate is really high so discount rate reflects it my growth rate over time I've followed the same principles I do with any company decreases down to a stable growth rate of 10 percent day of rep if I said I'm going to use a growth rate in perpetrative 10 a year forever if this were US Dollars you'd call me crazy that can't be it's an impossible valuation but when your inflation rate is 10 or 11 you can live with the 10 growth rate forever it's less than the risk credit that's the nice thing about using the risk-free rate as you can so the 10 growth rate forever gives the terminal value discounted all back the value per share you get is the present value so basically all I do is Project out earnings per share project out of payout ratio the reason the payout ratio changes over time is my growth is decreasing you discount the dividends per share at the cost of equity the value per share I get is about 42 Egyptian pounds per share the stock was actually trading at 36 I tried to actually buy the shares now how difficult it is by shares in the Egyptian Stock Exchange after by the third day I'm not even trying anymore and but this is a high inflation economy and dividend discount models are because of their ease you can use them around the world but implicitly you are trusting the bank to pay out what it can afford to pay out so next session after the quiz and I want to remind you first 30 minutes the question we're going to talk about how to Value Banks and you don't trust the managers the bank to pay out what they can afford and I'll be quite honest there isn't a single Bank in the world where I trust the managers to pay out what they can afford to anymore so I'll talk about the alternatives to dividends how you get a free cash flow equity for a bank but I think that it might be something that if you're valuable Bank you might want to try out not for the for tomorrow's valuation but after I give you the feedback on that if you used to Dividend discount model you might want to try the alternative which is to estimate with the Free Cash Road equity for a bank devalued on that basis I will see you on Monday so um 
there is okay amen these are these are great at corporate finance places could you put them in my office and you get exceptions foreign I do have three quizzes I gave today so I it's first in first out so I'm gonna grade the corporate finance quizzes that I gave this morning first and then I will turn my attention to you and then the undergraduate evaluation so if it takes a little later then usually it's because I'm getting the corporate finance quizzes out of the way so today I want to wrap up intrinsic valuation I can't find my remotes gone somewhere but I'm sure I'll find it one of these days so let's uh let's let's take up where we left off the last class we're talking about value Banks and I said with banks you have you're making a Faustian bargain busting bargain in the sense you don't know much about the bank the bank financials are opaque you have no idea what's going on behind but he accepted because you said The Regulators must be doing their job and I think I left you with the point that we no longer trust regulators and when we say we collectively we as investors we as depositors and this isn't just svb this traces back to 2008. and if you don't trust regulators and you don't trust Banks to be run by sensible people you can no longer just discount dividends everybody get that information because when you discount dividends you aren't trusted your trusting managers to pay out what they can afford to you're trusting Regulators to keep risk in life since in 2009 I started rethinking the way I value Banks I said I can't discount dividends it's not working for me anymore I have to estimate cash flows but I ran into a brick wall and the brick wall was the traditional way in which we estimate cash flows now even if it's cash flows to equity that's all you can focus on just net income plus depreciation minus capex minus change in working capital does not work for a bank or any Financial Service for a very simple reason what's depreciation for a bank right what do you depreciate what's capex for a bank it's not like you're making and what is working capital in some sense everything is working capital and nothing is working capital right every item is a financial asset or a financial Library so the way I decide to rethink this was I said okay I have to rethink what reinvestment for a bank is at any time I have a question about reinvestment the way I like think about it is for a bank to grow what does it have to invest in you might say it has to build more branches but that's a very 20th century view of a bank right and when was the last time you actually walked into a physical Bank branch for me it's like 12 years ago why would I go on to go on that what exactly am I going to get from a bank teller that I couldn't get from an ATM or do online so it's not physical investment but if you think about what banks need to do to grow is they need to maintain a regulatory Capital ratio what does that mean they need to bring in equity or you know the various definitions of regulatory Capital but some amount of equity so if you're growing you're a growing Bank you have to bring in more regulatory capitals if you're a bank and Trump what does it mean if you're in trouble you're taking a big loss so you've had multiple losses you have a fine imposed on you then you're again regulatory Capital poor to keep going as a bank you got to make up that deficit so I decided that the way to think about reinvestment for a bank is to think of how much will this Bank need to invest in regulatory Capital to keep going as a bank because I'm assuming it's a going concern and to grow if that's what I'm putting so my definition of free cash flow equity for a bank is to start with net income and subtract out whatever I have to invest in regulatory Capital so let's think about what this will mean you take two Banks they have the same projected net income but one is an undercapitalized bank and the other is an over capitalized Bank the way to show up is the under capitalized bank will actually reinvest more to get to a point of being healthy which means I'll have less cash flows to pay attention paired lesson so even if the managers refuse to acknowledge reality I'm going to estimate a free cash load Equity that reflects I want to capitalized you are if you're a growing Bank you'll have less to pay out why because to grow you got to reinvest more in regulatory capital so I'm going to use this structure to value a bank and it's a bank that I think of as one of those characters in a horror movie that keeps going back into the basement with the chainsaw loud there and then blood comes splurting out and it keeps doing it over and over again it's Deutsche Bank this is from a 2016 post I'll send you the actual post and I titled the post a Greek tragedy at a German bank and I chose the words deliberately you know how the Germans always look down at the Greeks right they're so undisciplined they can't run anything and here you have the ultimate German Institution behaving exactly the way the Greeks is supposed to behave at least in germaniz and let me you know set the table for why Dodge was in trouble in 2016. Deutsche if you go back 30 years had these visions of becoming an investment Bank it grew strongly and then 2008 came along and the bottom fell in it in fact every Bank was hurt by 2008 but Deutsche seemed to go back and get hurt over and over again so every year after 2008 it kept losing not just little money but a billion dollars a billion and a half two billion and you could throw in a trading loss in there to add to the losses so every time you lose money what happens you book equity it declines right normally for a traditional company say who cares but for a bank when book Equity declines your regulatory capital is also going to get impacted so the regulatory Capital kept dropping and they were in the danger zone already as they approached 2016. and in 2016 something happened that tipped them over the edge the Department of Justice find the impose a multi-billion dollar fine and then for something they did in 2008. now what does that mean that fine also comes out of book Equity so you take all of this money out of book Equity their tier one Capital ratio and you could pick any one of these Capital ratios you're it's really banking lingo one goes down the other goes down as well tier one Capital ratio starts with book equity and in my view should stop at book Equity but Bankers allow these little loopholes you have debt that looks like Equity we'll let you count it in but the reality it's book it's it's residual clicks that ratio is down to 12.15 your first reaction you look at that ratio let's be honest most of us don't sit around thinking about tier one Capital ratios it's not healthy so when you look at that ratio and say what does that even mean the only way to get a frame of reference and this is what I did when I valuedoches to compute that ratio for every Bank of the world sounds like a lot of work but remember you have that s p Capital IQ s p Capital IQ is still one tr2 it's got every number so doing this is a five minute job so it looks like it's more work but I computed that ratio across all backs now if you look at Money Center Banks because they're in riskier businesses like Investment Banking their tier one Capital ratios need to be higher precisely for regulatory reasons they're riskier Investments 12.15 was low relative to what typical Money Center banks operate which is around the 75th percentile which is like 15.67 so already you could see the whole is being dug right there are 12.41 they need to be at 15.67 percent and they need to get there and I did this valuation with rumors floating around that Deutsche might be taken into receivership remember with traditional companies you talk about bankruptcy and default but the bank you can't do that because they're depositors you can't liquidate a bank that's why when Banks get in trouble what happens then they get acquired by another bank you've got to keep it in the system because deposits have to be on so you look at First Republic even silicon value Bank somebody's going to pick up the residue they might get an incredible bargain Credit Suisse you know UBS might be getting a bargain but you're picking up this trouble back and there was stock that that might happen to Deutsche in 2016. now dcy I call Deutsche a horror movie what are we talking about right now you know now that Credit Suisse has gone under what's the next European bank that's in the Target Zone looks like Deutsche is back in the basement again with the chainsaw killer maybe it'll come out maybe it won't but you could see that but to add to the problem deutscho is losing billions of dollars it had a net loss of my of 8.9 billion dollars in the most recent year coming into the valuation and it didn't look like the losses would go away for the next two or three years so not only are they under capitalized there are money losing back so I put my Optimist hat on let's face it if you're if you're a pessimist you look at this and say this is a basket case I'm not touching this bank and that might be a healthy reaction but let's say you want to Value the bank you've got to put your Optimist hat on going for it it still is one of the largest banks in Europe it still has at least in Europe a significant Bank a set of branches and even if there's no growth if it gets back to health it has a pathway to survive and I'm going to be in a realistic on that if it makes it back to help my assumption is that the return in equity will go from negative to positive and will catch up to the cost of equity in other words in the long term the best I'm hoping that Deutsche can do is make its cost of equity so what about excess returns with Deutsche talking about excess returns sounds like an oxymoron I mean this is a bank that can't make money so my step and it's going to take time so over the next 10 years if you look at my return Equity here's what you will see my return on Equity starts at minus 13.7 percent and over time climbs to 9.44 that's awfully precise 9.44 but that's my cost of equity and steady state so as my return Equity goes from negative to positive my losses become profits and then from that net income or net loss I subtract out how much they will need to invest in regulatory Capital to get back to health so I have to dig them out of this minus 12.4 12.41 and dig them up to 15.67 so you see each uh my investment regulatory capital and it has consequences let's take year one my expected loss in year one is five 5.1 billions only five point one value you say what do you mean only 5.1 valid they lost 8.8 billion last year I'm saying okay they're going to move in the right direction they have an expected loss of 5.1 value but remember they need to fix this tier one Capital problem otherwise The Regulators are going to step in so year one you notice that I have to make an investment in regulatory capital of almost 6.6 billion you add those two numbers up my expected free cash flow equity in year one for deutsches about 11.7 billion dollars what does that mean what do I assume that Deutsche will have to do in year one for my going concern optimistic scenario to even will occur it left not just raise money it has to raise fresh equity and you know what banks think about issuing shares there's no choice here you have to raise fresh Equity to survive then YouTube more fresh Equity experience in fact collectively they've got to raise about 15 billion dollars over the next three three years not because they're growing but because of the whole that they've done for themselves and in this case I am assuming they will be able to do that what could intervene first is if the depositors catch wind of the fact that they're in trouble and they start withdrawing deposits there is no year to a year three it's going to spin very quickly out of control so you got to do this without panicking people which is the deadly mistake that Silicon Valley Bank made they knew they had to raise equity but they then let that out before they actually raise the equity they put the egg first and the chicken didn't come till later and by then it was too late because because people had panicked you could see why with banks this trust issue can very quickly start to unravel evaluation but my optimistic case I'm assuming they're going to be able to do that and because they're Deutsche in 2016 if you told people Deutsche is going to be in receiver they'd have laughed at you this is a 150 year old bank no Deutsche is not going on it's a large Bank so those free cash flows Equity reflect what the company will have to read eventually with my optimistic story here's what happens in year three or year four as my net income starts to come back and my po1 Capital finally gets close to where I need to be my cash flow is turned positive that free cash flow Equity is my potential dividend I'm replacing what the actual dividend is which for Deutsche thank God was zero with a negative free cash rate Equity because they have to actually raise fresh Equity to become a going concern those free cash flows to equity get discounted back at the cost of equity and with banks historically I've used the same cost of equity for banks why because unlevering and re-levering Banks is a pain and retouch I decided that was far too risky to do because you can have risky Banks and this is something that I you know I should have probably known going into 2008 pre-2008 my assumption was it can't be really risky Banks because The Regulators would have stopped it post 2008 I allow for the fact that you can have differences in risk and the way I showed is I computed the implied cost of equity for every Bank in the sample and went to the 75th percentile saying this is a risky bet I'm going to give them a high cost of equity so here's the combination I'm allowing for a recovery and income as negative return Equity becomes positive I'm allowing them to dig out of the hole and get their tier one Capital caught up to where it needs to be and I'm attaching a high cost of equity to this because I know it's a risky bank and eventually as they get to steady state I allow it to go to the median cost of equity that's where the 9.44 comes in lots of moving pieces in my story but if they all hang together what I get is a present value is about 22.97 per share in my optimistic story is there a chance the story couldn't travel of course there is a chance in 2016 I estimate to be around 10 why is it so low I'll be quite honest if this had been a small bank with these numbers try to attached a much higher likelihood of failure why because The Regulators are step in take what the larger Bank gets the more difficult it becomes to kind of force it out of business and get somebody to take it over it's one thing to get First Republic acquired by somebody else it's an entirely different problem trying to get Deutsche so what you know what's going to happen right they're going to put Band-Aids and Patchwork because nobody has an incentive here to push it over the edge nobody JP Morgan doesn't want First Republic to go under for selfish reasons because once One Bank goes under you can see what happens right the next weakest comes in line tonight nobody comes out of this as a winner so the low probability reflects could things change if another bank gets into trouble that failure rate starts to go up with respect and this is the problem with bags once One Bank gets into trouble so he valid Banks your failure rate has to go up across the board because in a sense you increase this risk of this trust loss spiraling out of control I looked at your DCFS and you should have got it back if you haven't got it back I I don't know where it is to be quite honest it's 2 455 emails ago so if you haven't got it back send it again I know there's a handful of you value bets but most of you luckily have picked bigger Banks but if pick a smaller Bank the valuation you do now will give you a lower value of equity than the valuation you did three weeks ago even if every single number looks the same because in a sense that's what a crisis does it makes every Bank more vulnerable to this trust failure and then the whole thing starts to unravel this was my 2008 lesson applied in 2009 what I'm now thinking about with Silicon Valley Bank is what would I have missed in a Silicon Valley Bank using this and here's what I think I'd have missed what's the original sin we talked about this at Silicon Valley Bank was guilty of that caused them to kind of go into this it wasn't that they made risky loans or at least we don't know that that was issue that wasn't there it was the fact that they're the duration mismatch right so what I'm trying to think of now is there a way I can look at duration mismatches at Banks and that information is actually public but it's kind of messy to dig up and bring it into the analysis how would I bring it in I've got to bring it in either into the cash flows the growth or the risk right and to me the most logical place to probably bring it in is to attach it to the cost of equity so up till now I've estimated cost of equity based on your tier one Capital ratios are they low or high and maybe I need to bring a second dimension in that if you have a duration mismatch I need too much to start using a much higher cost of equity with you as a bank because even if interest rates look good now you're always one interest rate shock away from things starting to undrive so any questions on banks investment Banks insurance companies because they're all they all share the same characteristics yes because when you're in trouble as a bank the big changes have to come what do The Regulators want if you tell them I'll make it end your plan and make an equal installment teacher you know what the regulator is going to say right no I need to see big changes immediately because I can't wait seven or eight years the nature of regulatory shortfalls is you got to make up most of it early in fact in some cases we have a Regulators really strict they might ask you to make up the whole thing next year I actually didn't finish the story the value per share I get with the failure rate is 2067 the stock was trading at 13.33. ask me the question I bought and and I mean it's one of those things I looked when so what was I thinking I did but I actually got lucky in the sense that they did a rights issue six months after I bought the stock for about 10 billion dollars it was a huge rights issue was that unexpected what does the right to issue do it raises Equity by issuing shares it below you look at the Free Cash Road Equity minus lab in Berlin you could see this coming I thought they would issue traditional shares they wouldn't put the rights issue which is good because lower issuance costs and they gave every shareholder in the company a chance to cash out because in a rights issue you can either exercise the right or sell the right back for cash I luckily picked the cell the rights back for cash I did for all the wrong reasons but thank God I did it because I cashed out on almost two thirds of my investment doge is still hanging out in my portfolio but at least I made two-thirds of my money back and at this stage it's more option than anything else if something good happens I'll take it and be icing on the cake if something bad happens because give me something else to abuse deuts Jehovah in future years but if you're valuing a bank again the traditional model dividend discount Model start with that it might work for your bank but I think we increasingly have to step away from that model simply because we've lost Trust and just as you know just as to close enclosure and financial service companies we put them all into one bundle but not all financial service companies are created equal you're valuing a PayPal or a MasterCard they are financial service companies but they're not like Banks they're really payment processing companies so I won't go into detail but a few in a lot was two years ago come this company called paytm Indian Payment Processing Company went public and I hadn't valued too many payment processing companies when I valued MasterCard and Visa long time ago but think of how a payment processing companies business works right every time somebody does a transaction on the platform and to spend money you get a piece of that it's called a take rate okay so when you look across credit cards go back you know forget about fintech you know look at MasterCard Visa American Express and use it at uh restaurant you look use it with a merchant you pay a hundred dollars what does a merchant get he gets 97 out of the 198. that take rate yeah historically if you look back in time American Express had the highest stake rate which is the reason fewer stores and restaurants except American Express because you're giving up more that take rate is two two and a half percent for MasterCard we said could be as high as four percent for American Express but if you look at the drivers of value here it's how many transactions happen on your platform and what percentage of that do you get to keep as a business so PayPal gets about 2.8 percent of the gross merchandise you could look at block and see what it keeps but basically that becomes a big metric so an evalu paytm I constructed my valuation by looking at gross merchandise and there's a story you can tell paytm is on 330 million phones in India it's that's a big selling point look at how many people so there's transactions going through the only problem is to give away almost everything for free which is when you look at their take rate translates into take rate of 0.6.7 it's one of the lowest take rates now if they're a healthy company what should they do you got 330 million users they're using transactions your take rate is too low for you to survive as a business I made the Assumption they were run by sensible people einstead terrible attention who would turn their attention away from their historical focus of adding users to the platform and actually focus on the take rate and actually projected out that the take rate would approve not to some immensely High number I don't think they're going to make it to PayPal level numbers because in Asia take rates 10 to be lower alipay is the same issue that over time they take grade would approve from 0.7 to 2 percent so rather than try to forecast revenues which is a aggregated number I forecast out the transaction value and the take right the product of those two gives a revenue I'm telling a big story for paytm but my big story is built around monetizing the user base and over time as they monetize their user base and the take rate goes from a low to a higher number it translates into actually actually making money in cash flows so I valued around 2 000 rupees per share when it came went public it was actually all you know the pricing was initially set at like 2800 and eventually it kept slipping now it's trading at like 500 rupees per share I get more emails about hey you screwed up on paytm no no you you know the classic you know clearly this is this shows that all valuation spell you know but I look back at this clearly there is something I miss and to me the biggest failure in my evaluation was assuming that paytm is actually run by people who actually knew how to run a business the problem is paytm is run by people who think that the objective of a business is to have the most users you can have a new platform and they seem almost unable to do the switch I made the mistake of installing the paytm app on my phone because I'd never use paytm in my life it's an Indian app that I applied every day I started getting a dozen notifications from paytm and free stuff I could get and that kind of cuts to the heart of the problem here they're so busy giving away free stuff and signing on more users that nobody at the company seems to have any sense of hey this is a business we've got 330 million users already but God said can you take your eye off the user account and start thinking about the take rate I thought they would do that I was sadly mistaken to be to me now I still I mean if I I no I I don't own the shares because I couldn't even participate in the IP but if I owned the shares you know what my Escape hatches here if you're a non-indian company let's say Indian you know Financial Service businesses are thrown open and you want to the enter the Indian market you know what I would do right if your MasterCard you want to grow your business in India among low income users just go by paytm you're getting it at a Bargain Basement price you get 330 million uses and hopefully you can take care of building the take rate this is a company the value of control is immense if somebody can take over the company and take the attention away from user content so if any of you are valuing payment processing companies that include you know PayPal block you know MasterCard Visa American Express start to look at it look take a look at their take rates it's somewhere in their financial statements you can see what the take rate is take look at trend lines American Express one of the challenges they face is their premium pay grade has been under challenge so they've introduced lower take rate versions of the American Express card so you could see that their premium model is going to just like any other business as you over time your your take rate declines it's going to show up as lower cash flows if you don't fix the problem so pay so financial service companies it's it's messier than regular companies but I think it's worth the effort and the problem here is to value a bank you need to invest in understanding banking regulation I know it's not the most fun thing to do I don't see a way around so let's talk about value companies with intangible assets it's kind of I I hate the word intangible accountants they've always created two sets of rules one for tangible assets one so they almost have intangible accounting versus tangible account to me they are you know ultimately the value of an ass comes from what in a discounted cash flow comes from the cash flows from that asset right I don't care whether it's physical or intangible but it is true that the way the accounting is done for companies with intangible assets makes it difficult to Grapple with evaluation so let me ask you the four questions again with the company within tangible that's a pharmaceutical company and ask you what are your cash flows of existing assets and you give me your income statement and your financial statements what's the biggest challenge I have you've taken your biggest capex treated as an operating expense in other words I have to go through your financial statements and redo them to actually get a sense of how much are you making how much are you reinvesting a lot more work right it's easier to deal with the manufacturing company where things are at least accounted for right when I ask you what's the value of growth if I haven't done my homework of capitalizing r d remember the big advantage of capitalizing r d is not that you change your cash flow last year but it tells you gives you a much better sense of not just how much you're investing but what kind of return you're making on your investor cap deciding whether there's value to growth you almost have to do those adjustments the risk I mean it's same thing risk in your cash flows with intangible assets you're looking at things like when will my patent expire the things that you might not worry at the manufacturing company so the basic process of value companies doesn't change just because you're a company with intangible assets but the way in which you get the information takes a lot more work because you have to redo the accounting that's basically what you're doing the income statement the balance sheet are being redone because you don't trust the accountants now I talk about companies with intangible assets I'm talking about almost all of the technology companies I think the accounting is just completely screwed up all of the pharmaceutical companies in fact you could argue that this is a bigger issue or this is the more the rule than the acceptance in the accounting doesn't work so when you look at companies with intangible assets of course we know what the accounting miscategorization is you know you see r d being classified as an operating expense but it's not just those companies consulting firms the cost of recruiting and training everything we talked about in the context of r d so what I thought I would do is talk about what are the adjustments to so this is revisiting what we did and in a sense this might be late in the process telling you why we do it so I took this is Amgen this is about 12 years 12 or 15 years ago at Value damage in the First Column or the the second column you see the accounting numbers that Amgen reported so the accountants are telling me that Amgen makes about 5.07 billion dollars in operating income they give me an invested capital in no I adjusted priority what does that mean I capitalize r d which changes my income my invested cap in the case of action when I did that my numbers change pretty dramatically my operating income went from 5 billion to 7.4 billion my invested Capital jumped you know why right because all that in capitalized r d goes into my invested capital I got something very unusual with the engine we'll talk about the significance of this their return on Capital actually went up for most companies we capitalize stuff but their operating income effect was far greater than the investment capital in fact the return Capital went up the reinvestment rate changed a little bit but basically the numbers were very different you're saying so what I actually did two valuations and you can each of you's capitalized r d in your evaluation you can try this out because it's just a yes no right if you say yes I capitalize r d i put all I adjust all the numbers I did my valuation of Amgen first doing the right thing which in my view is capitalizing r d and then I turned off the r d option which means I'm going to Value Amgen trusting the accounting numbers you think I'm going to get the same value for Amgen if I did why waste my time right we do this because it's going to change the value so I valued I got the value per share take a look at the bottom line there I get a value per share of 43 dollars when I value Amgen using the accounting numbers and I get a value of seventy four dollars when I capitalize r d it's great right so when you capitalize r d your value per share goes up is that always going to be true or let me rephrase the question what is it that I'm learning about Amgen from looking at those two values that when the value per share goes up and you capitalize already what is it telling me about the type of r d that Andrew is doing in fact r d is like any other capex right it can be value-adding value neutral or value destruction you can have good r d and bad r d when I capitalize Amgen and the value goes up you know what I'm learning that at least over this their history Amgen has done value creating r d what does that mean they invest money in r d or they expend it they've converted into higher revenues and higher profits and I'm capturing that effect in my value I did the same thing for Merc at the time that I valued action in other words I valued it without the already adjustment with the r d adjustment and there the value per share went from 37 per share to 26 dollars per shot in other words capitalizing r d push down the value why because Mark at least over the period that I looked at them I'd kept spending more and money more money on R D but their income stayed flat which meant that they weren't getting any payoff the value went down because once I started trading r d as a capital expense and said this company is going to continue to do this it brought down the value so in short when you capitalize already the reason you're doing it is we want to make a judgment of is this the kind of company where Rd is creating value or the kind of company where it's destroying value and I think the answer to that question is critical right if you take a technology company and they're spending billions of dollars in r d and you keep saying that's good I'm going to increase their value and half of them are wasting that r d you're in fact pushing up value and you should be pushing down that so when you capitalize in these these expenses like r d That's effectively why you're doing it is to capture that effort so with intangibles you don't have to do anything different but you have to try to take expenses that are capital expenses that are being treated as operating expenses into this search let's move to commodity and cyclical accomplished it's like a mature commodity company in fact the most the last valuation I got came in this morning it's evaluation of a ramco yes it's Javier here no this is as mature an oil company as you can get right this is their operating income jumped by 40 between 2021 and 2022 and it's going to be up by 14 20 22-23 it was down I think 18 in 2020. that's not a way a mature company behaves right but what's causing the operating income for our arm core to be all over the place it's oil prices it's not that they're producing more or less oil it's oil prices going up and down you see where I'm going even the most mature commodity and cyclical companies will have wallet learnings their earnings will go up so they're any given year you can see a 20 jumping on it or a 15 drop because of what's happening so every question I ask you about the company that's a macro reason for why it's changing and ask you what are your cash flows my existing assets and you show me the last 10 years for Exxon Mobil or Royal Dutch the numbers are going to be all over the place but if you then put the oil price each you can see very quickly what's traffic it's driven by a macro Factor when I ask you is there value added or destroyed by your oil exploration if I ask you this question in March of 2020 when oil press was 32 almost everything you do is destroying that right at a hundred dollars everything is creating value so you go you swing from hey this is a terrible company this is an amazing company and when you think about risk in these companies and let's keep the ESC issue out because that's going to also come into play here the risk in these companies comes from the fact that you're as your your oil prices go up and down you can go from being a very safe company one year because oil price a hundred dollars in the same company two years later could be on the verge of disaster or oil prices drop to 30. I mean let me cut the the long story short in fact the final question about when will you be a mature company with commodity companies at least there is this question you got to ask is there's a finite amount of that commodity in the face of the Earth so how can I assume a two percent growth rate forever when you're going to run out of oil or gold eventually maybe the argument is with commodity companies we should be using perpetuities we should have a finite period when it's done you run out so with with these companies you can already see that there's a macro component driving the valuation and it's almost a given so even the most mature oil company it's fortunes are driven by oil prices you know what you're going to be tempted to do then when you value Royal Dutch because oil prices are such a big factor you're going to be tempted to play oil price prognosticator for God's sakes don't because I'll save you the trouble let's assume that you expect oil prices it's your view no you've got this Crystal Ball you've looked at to go up 15 here for the next five years I'll save you the trouble every oil company is going to look cheap to you you think so what then I'm going to follow up and ask you a question why is Royal Dutch looking cheap to you is it because you like the company or because you think oil prices will go up 15 here why do I care what the answer is if it's a ladder what should you do if you're that good at forecasting oil prices what the heck are you doing Welling Royal Dutch go buy oil Futures you make a lot of money if you're good at forecasting macro stuff for God's sake stop dealing with companies you got an easier way to make money and how good are prognosticators who forecast oil prices they exist to make food sales look good why are you messing with this and if you do you can already see I have a problem every valuation there will be a joint effect of what do you think about the company and what you think about oil prices what do you think about the company and what do you think about the economy it's cyclical companies I'm going to make a suggestion that's really difficult to follow and I have trouble following it try to be as macron and neutral as you can be when you value a macro driven company so what am I telling you though when you value an oil company take the price of oil as is don't play games with it if you want to use Market numbers for future oil price which you can sometimes get but remember Futures oil prices are driven by Arbitrage it's part oil price and storage costs if you want to use those fine but don't bring in an expert's view on oil prices or your view on oil prices because then you mess up two things in the same valuation so I'm going to use an example to illustrate this and it's a company that that so I'll come back to this no Israel Dutch one of the oldest oil companies around large integrated oil companies so this is a valuation I did of Royal Dutch in March of 2016. for their Finance group in Houston so you know I went in and they said no do you value Royal Dutch and the time oil prices had dropped significantly over the previous year from seventy dollars down to 45. okay so as you look at this valuation you're going to see my attempt to Value Royal Dutch and be Market macro neutral at the same time I'm going to Value Royal debts it's a conditional valuation now I want to give you a royal evaluation of royal touch at a 45 oil price now let me ask you a question you value a road that's at a 45 oil price if oil prices go to 60 what's going to happen the value it's going to go up and go to 30. so in a sense I'm going to leave the oil price judgment out of it and say given the oil price today is Royal Dutch under over that and it was actually really difficult to be macronutrient here's why what do we usually start with as a as a base numbers you look at the last 12 months you look at revenues operating income cash flows and what is that happen to oil prices over the previous year they've gone from 70 dollars to forty five dollars right I have a problem here the problem is if I take the trailing 12 month numbers I will overvalue the company does everybody see why because Australian 12-month numbers reflect an oil price of 70 dollars I if oil price of 45 I'm going to find the company are developed by just plug the numbers into an Excel spreadsheet I would love to know what Royal Dutch is revenues and profits would be if oil prices were actually 45. in other words I don't want to look at the trail in 12 months this and at least with mature oil companies you can try this here's what I did I looked at Royal Dutch's revenues over time it's been around forever so these are the Royal so the The Columns of the Royal Dutch revenues each year the brown line is actually oil prices each year average oil prices do the two look like they move together there's a 96 r squared now in fact at the at the presentation somebody asked me do you know who Roy Dutch's CEO is and I said I don't know and I don't care what's he going to do anyway come in and look at the terminal a little more carefully this is a pure oil price plan but that's the other Advantage from this graph I ran a regression of revenues at Royal Dutch against the oil price you're saying what's that going to tell take a look at the coefficient of the regression 4039.39 what does that tell me every one dollar increase in oil prices increases my revenues by four billion dollars it's effortless but it cuts the other way as well now what's the question I was trying to answer at a 45 oil price what would Royal Dutch's revenues be right you plug in a 45 oil price into that regression you're going to get a predicted revenue for Royal Dutch given oil prices of 45 dollars basically it allows me to become macronutral by bringing in the oil price and that's what I used we go back to the previous Pages my base year revenues is not the revenues from the trail in 12 months but the revenue I'm sorry it was a 40 oil price the revenue is at a 40 oil price so I've lowered the revenues from the actual revenues not because I want to punish the company but you can see how it could cut the other way as well right let's say that you're valuing an oil company in early 2021 you look at the last 12 months they're going to look horrifically bad because you had covered and all prices dropped to thirty dollars a barrel but rather than use a trailing 12 month numbers I'm going to look at the 60 oil prices saw already by 2021 and estimated revenue and for a company like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch and aramco you're going to see the relationship you saw with our with Royal Dutch player so I finished the valuation I come up with a value of about 39 the stock is trading at 42. of course people are saying aren't you uncertain about the oil prices I said of course I and you are uncertain as well nobody's certain about the oil price but so what we're uncertain about lots of things they said would value be affected absolutely and if you're you have something that's hanging over your valuation that's making you uncomfortable they're taught to do two things right what-if questions and it's kind of useless here to ask what if questions because here's what the word of questions are going to look like if oil prices go up the Stock's worth a lot of oil prices go down they were not worth very much thank you for letting me know but not much is learned right so here's the last thing I did now I use crystal ball this this add-on to excel that you can get us you know what's the one number in this valuation that I'm uncertain about it's the oil price right I know the current price is 40 but I didn't know it could go into 60 if you go to 20. I made it a distribution based on the history of oil prices so rather than do one valuation I said look I'm uncertain about the oil price you're uncertain about the oil price I'm not going to take a point of view on oil prices because I'm not good at forecasting oil prices but I do know that oil prices will change so the simulation here's what you do you go pluck number out of the distribution let's say the first number you come up with is 53 dollars because in the distribution that's feasible I value Royal tax at 53. I come up with a much higher value second one 36 dollars I get a lower value and I repeat this over and over again the default in crystal ball is 10 000 simulations and each time you run one you get a value and at the bottom I have actually bottom right hand corner I have actually a distribution of valued royalty actually saying what do I do with that if I take the average value across the distribution I get roughly the same value that I got with my base case valuation saying I wasted my time to find that but I can also give you a distribution I could say this is the first quartile this is so at the time that I that I did the stock was trading at 42 it was trading at roughly the 62nd or the 63rd percentile there because you look at the distribution which means that at its current price I can say it as a 63 chance it's overvalued at 37 chance it's on demand think like a portfolio manager rather than give you a price and a value for every company think about me giving your distribution and then you can impose your own rules I will buy a stock only if it's at the 40th percentile or below I would sell a stock once it gets above the 75th percentile you now have more information to make your decisions why haven't we always done this 30 years ago to run a Monte Carlo simulation would have cost you millions of dollars you need in a Mainframe computer and you needed and then somebody would actually program it for you today it's free for you every one of your evaluations you can convert into a Monte Carlo simulation so you can take evaluation at crystal ball and that Revenue growth margin and sales to Capital number that you were so that made you so uncomfortable and it should right you're uncertain you can make each of those numbers into a distribution of course the only thing is it's garbage in garbage out so if you pick random distributions and random parameters you'll get great looking output if it's still garbage so you're going to do this it will mean that you can't just tell me you're uncertain you got to start to put some numbers around this is how uncertain I am this is the high number but it's useful that I think is the healthy way to deal with uncertainty look it in the face make your best estimates and at least now it's not a point number you can give me a distribution and come up with a distribution of that so I'm Gonna Leave You with that and on Wednesday we will be starting on packet two there are a few more pages here that I want to complete but we'll start with packet two so make sure you print off packet two and bring it with you to class okay what the relation to the business the price of oil I have a lot of discussions about how probably in my last job and I came to the conclusion that correlating crisis uh seemed a little bit weird because they they they're not independent with each other they're like Auto correlation yeah they're not always correlation okay it doesn't matter the price of the autopilot right your income jumps around it's got nothing to do with price we're still going to even if there's Auto correlation in price levels if your income is not related to price you're still going to get a low correlation in your revenues because this is a correlation across too there right so unless you can show me the important correlation phrase is automatically driving all the correlation revenues to still have two variables so having an order correlation in one of the two variables doesn't stop you from Computing Auto correlation becomes an issue if you games and time series to forecast you're not forecasting this you're not I'm not focused I'm just trying to find the relationship if you're forecasting order correlations because it exaggerates your power to both have the future the correlation number is too high because over the time series it looks like you're forecasting power and all you're doing is catching that you know your to your channel but why not currently the return there isn't there more robust I have a very singular task I want to forecast revenues in a 40 oil price I'm not trying to decide whether oil companies are good Investments about industry that's a difference okay that I would add you know random aggression differently I would have a lagged the question okay yeah because I kind of observed the oils and go back and invest in that yes if I want to see our oil companies good or bad Investments after oil prices have gone up or after all the breaks that have gone down then I can run a very different kind of analysis so look at returns in all companies and regress them against all the price change the previous show right and see if yourself and see if there's see if there's a lick and if there's a link then ask you know is this a potential way for me to make money because it looks like the buying oil companies right after oil prices have dropped delivers higher returns and buying all companies after their bill but that would require that there you would use return because you're asking and answering a very different question here it's a contemporaneous regression all I'm asking is when oil prices change what happens to Royal Dutch's revenues and the answer is almost everything that happens to revenge is coming from oil prices changing because it's a mature Oil Company the correlation is going to be low when you take a Young Oil Company because their production your the number of barrels of all value change you know so basically each year everything else is also changing because you're exploring more you're bringing new Fields online there the correlation below and that's more difficult to forecast that but the revenues would be what's the name crystal ball videos so if you're going to buy it as a student which is a hundred dollars they have different programs you can buy a legacy which stays on but you get no upgrade so you can get an update Virginia so if you're not adding parameters do you think your existing parameter is making a distributions and you can add as many distributions as you want you can have only one output there to begin with many input distributions it allows you to put in correlations across the distribution looks like you're still avoiding with them so the paytm 
foreign there's actually a packet three it's kind of scary thought we have 11 sessions left and two more packets to get through it um foreign okay folks let's get started I hope you had a chance to pick up your quiz if not it's still up there so try to pick it up as soon as you can so you can at least check the grading make sure I haven't missed messed up So today we're going to change gears we're going to actually talk about pricing things rather than value so as a lead-in let's start with a question and in fact I'm going to start by by noting that almost everything that you see out there that passes the valuation is really a pricing in Disguise people like to price things whether they use multiples and comparables or whether they use some other metric basically people like to price things and one of the reasons I've heard from analysts as to why they prefer to price stocks rather than do intrinsic valuation is their argument is you need to make less assumptions and let me ask you let's start with the easy question when you had to value a company did you have to make assumptions absolutely about growth and margins and reinvestment and risk was it a pain in the neck absolutely so much work right you got to understand the business and the competition so the argument they make is when I use a p e Ratio or an EB debit I don't have to do any of that stuff technically the answer yeah that's true right but one of the things we're going to talk about in the context of pricing is is that really true are you not making assumptions or is the truth a little more difficult to get there what exactly is happening when you're doing pricing you're not making explicit assumptions right are you making implicit assumptions absolutely you never State them and that's part of the problem so when you compare your company to the average p e ratio for the sector you are making implicit assumptions about your company could they be wrong absolutely and in fact we're going to talk about some of the things that can cause your company to have a PE ratio very different from the average and still be not mispresented back price track the second thing I'm going to talk about today is statistics and you're going to see the shift again I mean we really haven't done much statistics through intrinsic valuation but I'm going to argue that the skill set you need to deal with pricing is actually statistics because what statistics designed to do what's what what's your what's the object of the discipline what are we trying to do in statistics trying to make sense of large and contradictory data both pieces have to if it's just five observations you don't need statistics you could eyeball the data if the data all points in the same direction you don't need statistics the data kind of it's when the data is pulling in different directions and it's too difficult for you to get your eyeballs around statistics comes in useful if I taught a statistical attack card I don't have to I'd use entirely Financial Market data if you illustrate it because it's perfect this was Big Data before Big Data was even invented financial markets with the original places where huge amounts of data pulling in different directions and what are the things we talk about in statistics is distributions right so let's suppose I took the p e ratio for every company in a market you can make whichever Market you want and I drew a histogram remember histograms and statistics you caught the number of companies p ratio zero to four four two eight eight to twelve and I put up a distribution will that distribution ever look like that distribution we so love its statistics classes the normal distribution in fact let's step back what is it that's so nice about the normal distribution statistics why when you see a normal distribution should you celebrate what makes it easy to work with I'm sorry what symmetry symmetry but what does the Symmetry give us you could describe a normal distribution with you that's right the mean and the standard deviation whereas if you take more complex distributions I have to give you the mean the standard deviation the skewness I mean there are all these other things to control for it makes life a lot simpler if you have a normal distribution can a p ratio have a normal distribution remember your normal distribution what's what are the limits on a normal distribution you go to the tails minus infinity to plus infinity right the Tails which either get really thin at the end what's the lowest number of PE ratio can take have you ever seen a negative p ratio no you don't you know why because when the earnings turn negative the p e ratio becomes not meaningful to the lowest value p ratio can have a zero what's the highest value of p ratio container today I'm going to show the PE ratios for U.S companies that started 2023. you know the highest p ratio is 86 400. you see that must be one absurdly highly priced stock it was actually was it was like a 7.50 stock but the earnings per share dropped to a fraction of a set so the lowest value you could take is zero there is no limit on the upper value so you know already what the distribution is going to look like right it's going to have a right tail that stretches out you think who cares this is inside Statistics stuff I don't know about you but I remember what my statistics Professor told me about these distributions they're called asymmetric distributions and you want us never trust the average when you have an asymmetric distribution why not there's going to be a skew right basically all your outliers are big positive numbers there's no big negative numbers to offset the average is going to give you a number that's too high to describe the distribution and I remember simplistic advice when you have asymmetric distribution trust the median it's a more meaningful number I'm going to show you the difference between the average speed for U.S stocks and the median p and it's going to be shocking how big a difference there is but the next time you're an analyst on CNBC say this stock is cheap because it trades that less than the average P for the sector you know what the anchor should really ask the analysts right what's the median and I waged that the analyst doesn't know if you don't know what the median is you should be banned from ever talking about pricing because you've missed basic statistics and finally suppose you find a company that trades at a p-ration software company trading at a PE ratio of 12. the average for the sector or the median for the sector is 20 let's suppose we're not playing the average the median for the sector is 20. and you're trying to make a judgment So based on those numbers what's the usual judgment it's it looks cheap right but what else could explain why a stock could have a p ratio of 12. let's start building the foundations the kinds of questions you need to ask let's say I'm the person telling you this this idea stock is cheap because it's PE ratio is less than the PE ratio for the sector and I'll give you a chance to ask me questions what's the first question you're going to ask me to try to figure out whether whether it's really cheap go with your fundamentals what is the growth rate and most of the time what's the answer going to be it's minus five percent a year and the sector is growing at 10 or the two percent the other sector is going at 20. so one reason could be that it has much lower growth than the growth of the sector right second Quest stay with it what how risky are you but you don't want cost Capital it's cost of equity because it's a p rich but staying with it how risky I use a company so even if you don't want to talk about cost of equities and odds are that many companies that trade at low PE ratios are there because they're much riskier companies so growth matters risk matters the third and final question can we talked about growth not all growth is created equal right some growth is better than others and at least in the context of equity what drives the value of growth what what kind of return and Equity do you earn if your company with a higher return in equity then you should earn it so you're going to ask me what's my growth rate what's my risk what's my return in equity and by the time I finish answering these three questions you know what you're going to find right for every 100 companies that look cheap you're going to find that 95 deserve to be cheap there's some reason but there might be those two or three companies where after you ask these three questions you feel okay that's you know that's the problem with pricing is not that people do it but they they're often too lazy to ask the questions you need to get answered before you decide something is cheap and that's basically what we're going to do with every multiple is come up with a list of here are the questions you need to ask whether it's PE or Price to Book or EV turbot or even sales because if you can ask those questions you can do pricing well I don't have a problem with pricing but I have a problem with sloppy pricing so let's think about the driver's surprise so I'm going to go back to the last part of the first packet don't worry if you didn't don't have it there's like seven pages because it lays the foundation oh it's going to cut so everything we've done in this class so this is 6 17 session has been about coming up with intrinsic value right so if I actually summarize what drives intrinsic value it's cash flows growth and risk a discarded cash flow model might be the vehicle you used to deliver those assumptions but it's cash flows growth and risk what drives price it's demand and supply you think our demand and Supply driven by cash flows growth and risk yes but they're also driven by mood and momentum in fact for the last 50 years in finance behavior of finances developed as an area to explain why people might price things that should not be in the valley because of emotions because of mood because the crowd is doing it is the value process that's the pricing process the value process delivers value the pricing process delivers price could there be a gap between the two numbers almost always the question of what you think about the Gap is what drives different schools of thought in investing if you're a believer in efficient markets you basically say what cat because inefficient markets if there's a gap it quickly disappears even if it opens up it's random and it disappears because in efficient markets at least on average the price and the value converge so if you lived in an efficient market you shouldn't really be taking this class to Value public companies right the price is already out there it's a best estimate of the bad and you might come to that conclusion after you valued a couple of companies and you might say I'm making these assumptions I have no idea what I'm doing you know what that's a healthy conclusion think of how much money it's going to save you and how much time it's going to save you you just buy index funds and you go back to living the rest of your life because your job might be valued companies but you don't have to believe in valuation to Value companies you just have to go through the motions if you are a Value Extra you think who's the value extras they show up in Omaha every year once a year they believe the whole world revolves around value value extremists think that the price process is always wrong the value process is the right one so what do they do if something is undervalued they buy it and they assume that because the pricing process always wrong that errors get corrected they'll make mistake so there's not even a sense of Doubt with value experts it's always value pricing process so they don't waste any time on pricing they think it's a waste of time and finally there are pricing extras what are those they're the ones that said what is this intrinsic value talk about there's no such thing it's in your head my favorite show on CNBC to be on is Fast Money it's a show that happens after the market closes it's actually where they get four Traders on the and you've seen the show it's a it's basically these guys are Traders so like reason I like the choice there's there's no pretension there they don't talk so they whenever I show him they say what is this value thing you're talking about who cares and I like that Honesty because debut is values is intellectual stuff you do but pricing is demand in Supply what trade is what do we care about buy at a low price sell at a high price if we do that with charts grade if we do that with some other indicator it's great we do it in inside information even better but it's all about pricing who cares about value what I'd like to at least set up as process is to think about what each of these groups has its dilemma the efficient market group is the only one that has no dilemmas they're secure and Gene farmer sleeps well at night saying you know what markets are almost always right why am I wasting my time but let's say you're in the value cap presumably because you take this class you believe there's at least a chance that you can use it let's think about the dilemmas you face in putting this into practice and actually making money at it the first is you each valued a company you send your evaluations I said okay not okay you know whatever I said though are you uncertain about that value I hope so because otherwise you've got something wrong with you right because you made a lot of assumptions to get that Revenue growth margins but of course you're uncertain about the value so when somebody says I know the value of the company I don't think you can use the word no I've estimated the value of the company and there's a range around that value so you're uncertain about that could be wrong but what's the other piece of the puzzle for you to make money the price has to adjust to Value so even if you write about value the price has to are you uncertain about whether or when that will happen you should be why because you don't control the market you see the two uncertainties bubbling up to the surface you're uncertain about your value or uncertain about price adjustment value which is one reason I Diversified because I know I'm going to screw up in individual companies hopefully I don't screw up on all 50 because that's sending me a signal saying why are you wasting your time doing this go back to buying an index fund so whenever say somebody says I have a concentrated portfolio you know traditional value investors just by four or five companies two questions there what makes you so sure about the value you have for each of the five companies and what makes you so sure that the price will adjust to Value because both have to be you have to be pretty sure to say I put all my bets on four or five companies so if you're a value if you're a believer in value think about those things because that price adjustment to values out of your control of course let's say you still believe in value say price will adjust to badner here are the two Pathways you can adopt on that price adjusting Value First is what I call the karmic beer which is I've done my job I've done all the homework I value the company the price is what it is and it'll adjust will not adjust it's not in my control the karmic view says I don't control that so worrying about it is not going to make it happen or you could try to find a catalyst that causes the correction we talked about some of this the Catalyst could be please God let a call I can't show up at the company that I just bought because he can make the price move to that or you can look for other catalysts that cause I think we mentioned right at the start of the class the other Catalyst could be a CEO passing on a new management coming into play the company itself hitting a trigger number I'll give you an example when I remember when um apple and Amazon both crossed a trillion dollars in market cap there's nothing special about 1 000 billion right because 990 because in terms of numbers there's nothing really but there seems to be some magic we attached to the market Crossing forty thousand thirty five thousand and from an intrinsic value standpoint people say who really cares but I think we should and here's what when a company hits these arbitrary targets more attention is played to the company right because it hits and one of the arguments you can make is the reason that it might matter to you is that might be the Catalyst that causes the price correction so maybe you think a stock is over well and in 995 dollars nobody knows but if it's a thousand dollars and all of a sudden people look and say you know what we pay 500 times revenues for this company maybe we're paying too much so one of the things I think if you're a believer in value I'd like you to start thinking about is what is some of the cathodes I would look for when I decide to buy a company take a look at all the data items s p Capital IQ has on companies in addition to all the financials they actually also have the age of the CEO the board of directors they have an activism score it's a whole host of numbers you might use to decide where that correction is most likely so I'll give give away where I come from I believe in value but I also know I'm going to be wrong and value and I don't control the pricing process no so if you get a chance and you go back and be valuing apple every year since 2009 I confess I'm I'm biased again the biased towards Apple it pushes up my value but I bought Apple five times in the last 14 years and I've sold Apple four types again it's back in my portfolio after a long no and it's a company that I think has had pretty much the same story the values stayed pretty stable but if you look across time there's my value per share different points in time in the second column the price per share and you can see it goes from being undervalued to overvalued to undervalued to overvalue and that's the way I think about markets it's not that they are screwed up but they overshoot and they undershoot they overshoot and and that's good because something that looks overvalued today could very well become undervalued especially if it's the kind of company that's overvalued by 60 percent it's overvalued by 60 when it gets undervalued just doesn't doesn't stop it being five percent undervalued it'll shoot in the other direction so what makes it overvalued by large percentages is also going to make it undivided no if you think about what we're trying to do here is to get to the comfort point we're actually willing to put real money behind your buy or yourself it's easy in the abstract to find something to be under that it's difficult in practice to actually put your money in that company and there's no easy pathway you've got to find that comfort zone and that's basically what you're looking for when you look at the pricing process so I'm going to close this section with the shot from one of my favorite movies no which one this is right come on The Wizard of Oz the colorized version or the recolorized version I think they digitize the colors much better you guys remember the story The Wizard of Oz I'll tell you the story and as I tell you don't jump on me because I don't make up these stories it's about a girl called Dorothy who lives in Kansas and a tornado sucks her up and drops her into this mythical land collage you're saying this is so unrealistic I'm not telling the story this is the actual story of The Wizard of Oz she lands on a witch I don't know I always get the mixed up which of the east or which of the West and she kills The Witch she's facing homicide charges and she wants to get back to Kansas so that's how the movie starts with this tornado so don't take you take your kid 10 minutes into the movie because the first 10 minutes are kind of traumatic so she wants to get back to Kansas and she's not where no idea where to go so she does this munchkin by the side of the road and she says I want to get to Kansas can you tell me how and he says I have no idea where Kansas is but you should go ask The Wizard of Oz here's the answer to every question that people have he knows everything he said how do you get to The Wizard of Oz so Follow the yellow brick road and for three and a half hours this is what she does she Hops and she skips and she she never walks if you don't believe me watch the movie She's always hopping and skipping down and along the way she collects her Motley Crew a lion which is cowardly a scarecrower they all want something and they're also go see The Wizard of Oz He has the answer to every question you might have three and a half hours later it's a really long movie they arrive at the chambers of the wizard they all walk in and they all state what they want so Dorothy said I want to go back to Kansas the Cowardly Lion says I want courage and The Wizard says come back tomorrow this is like a government office and at that point the curtain Falls the wizard is behind the cut and he says come back tomorrow the curtain Falls map you know wardrobe malfunction I guess and they see that there's no wizard there's this guy with you know always pulling things and essentially there's no Wizard of Oz it's got to do with evaluation if you watch the movie it turns out that each of them got what they were looking for on the journey Dorothy found these red shoes that all she has to do is click the shoes she's back in Kansas the Cowardly Lion fought off some bad guys and along the way she already had courage essentially they learned everything that or they got what they wanted on the journey just to go see what this has got to do with evaluation right evaluation people are looking for somebody who has all the answers that might be Google search or chat GPT tell me what to do and you constantly searching but the answer often lies in reasoning through the process so when you're sitting there what tax rate should I use on my earnings to get to cash flows I mean you can email me during the class and maybe I will tell you the answer but you can reason your way to the to that answer because if you think about what am I trying to do here I'm trying to collect to estimate what my total earnings will be and what I'd have to pay in taxes like The Wizard of Oz you learn valuation on the journey you learn valuation by doing you learn valuation by getting stuck and unsticking yourself by reasoning your way to an answer I wrote a piece for uh for a teaching Journal saying the curse of Google Search you know why right because when you have a question now what do you what's your first information let me go look it up on Google search Somebody's come up with the answer and nine times out of ten you're probably right it saves you time because somebody else has already come up with the answer but in the process I think we're losing something of immense value which is learning to reason our way to answers to questions so the next time you get stuck on something you already have the ammunition you know as much about valuation at this point as I do the only thing is I mean I'm about a thousand companies ahead of you and having tried this learned the hard way that didn't work but try to reason your way to an answer because in a sense you're developed it's like any other muscle you don't use it it's going to go away and I think increasingly we're losing the capacity to reason because we're too busy reading what other people think or looking up what other people's answers are so at least an intrinsic valuation the answer often Lies by going back and asking what is the question I'm trying to address so that's the last you'll hear from from about intrinsic valuation athletes at the moment so let me start on packet two because the rest of today is going to be pricing sorry that's wrong one okay let's set the table an intrinsic valuation you try to value a company based on its cash flows growth and risk in pricing you're trying to estimate what to pay for something based on what other people are paying for similar things so let's start with a very simple example my youngest son lives and works in New York so we're going to go to opening day Yankee Stadium but he had to work his employer for whatever reason insists that he worked between one and four in the afternoon I said he couldn't make it so he said Sunday we'll do it so two days later and you know he keeps still keeps college student hours which means he goes to bed garden he knows when wakes up weekdays he has to wake up to go to work but weekends so the game is a 1 30 game I call him at 10 I call him at 11 and 11 30 12 he's not picking up the phone 2 30 he texts me saying did you buy tickets to the evening game and I said what evening game The Game's happening right now you slept all the way through it she said sorry Dad could do it in a couple of weeks so I no I I'm I bought tickets to the the I think it's uh I don't know who's coming this two weeks from now might be the Twins game so the way I bought tickets is I went on seed kick now you're buying a ticket you're saying how much should I pay see geek makes life really simple baby you've ever used this side seed cake is a is an aggregated side with sites like StubHub and other sites where you could buy tickets the nice thing about SeatGeek is not only does it aggregate it does your home work for you so I wanted something at field level because it would be fun so I got a few levels and and I picked SeatGeek I actually classifies deals from outstanding deals to horrific deals I don't think they use the word horrific but basically the class but you know what they do right they take the price per seat in each section they compare to other people trying to sell seats in that section and they compare the price that's being asked for a seat to the prices of other seeds in the section and if the price is much slower you're getting an I think awesome deal might be what they call it I got an awesome deal I got a 30 dollar field level seat this might be a complete no I haven't got confirmation so maybe this is a rip-off but seed people usually refund me if that is okay it's thirty dollars for a field level seat at Yankee Stadium you can't even get bleacher seats for thirty dollars that's an awesome price how do I know because I can see what the prices around me are going for and they're going for like 150 so either this person was drunk when they're listed all the seats don't exist in which case one way or the other I'm going to find out but the essence of pricing is what do you do you look at first you identify comparable as in this case seats in the same section I can't just compare seats across Yankee Stadium because a bleacher seed and a field level seed are different the seats are all the same they're all uncomfortable blue plastic seats are but if you had cushioned seats and you know you might have to adjust with the seat size and seat Comfort but usually then you have standardize the price and then you compare across a first row seed is going to be worth more than a fifth row seat because you're right on the feet that's pricing we do it all the time and in the context of stocks it shows up as finding companies that you say are just like your company standardizing the price there so there usually means dividing the price by something price by earnings price per box a multiple and controlling for differences will be why do some companies have higher p e ratios than us growth and risk and cash flows all the things you were running away from in intrinsic valuation so I'm going to start with a statement about pricing that I think I can back up when I say that almost everything that passes for valuation out there is pricing here's where I make that statement about 20 years ago I collected about 550 equity research reports from around the world I confess I didn't read them I collected them because I wanted to Chronicle how equity research analysts put buy or sell recommendations what did they do so I'd summarize what I found out of the 550 equity research reports 45 were intrinsic valuations they did a DCF and they put a buyer a cell base that's less than 10 percent about 450 used to multiple in a comparable they were making a pricing judgment ten to one pricing outnumbered intrinsic valuation I think 450 plus 45 is 495 what about the other 55 I was completely mystified as what they were doing or maybe they were using tarot cards and doing something but I have no idea but among the ones I could classify ten to one pricing outnumbers if you don't believe me walk into a gold with extra mortgage Stanley but they have all the equity research reports lined up pick up each one and read it you you're going to see roughly the same test equity research is almost all pricing all the time I thought it might be different in corporate finance when you do Acquisitions you're buying a whole business I assume there'd be more discounted cash flow valuations and on the surface I was right I actually got my hands in about on about a hundred acquisition valuations they're really difficult to get your hands on because you know what happens to them after they're actually used they've gone to a shelf that so that nobody can ever see the forecast you've used before so it looked like almost 50 50. half of these looked like they were discount discounted cash flow valuations until I took a closer look now I discovered very quickly that they weren't DCFS they were actually pricing in Drag why what's the biggest number in the DCF the terminal value and how do the terminal value estimated using a multiple of our revenues so even in m a it seems like pricing dominates and almost every investing rule is based in some kind of a multiple right a p e ratio less than 10 is cheaper price to book less than one it's cheaper PEG ratio less than everything is stated in terms of pricing metrics not in terms of intrinsic valuation so I think it's silly to argue against the idea that pricing is what most people use even though they might go through the motions of this kind of cash flow evaluation and that puzzled me a little bit when I first uncovered because there's going to be an exit interview I do when you leave this class you've already seen the question you know the question is I'm going to ask you right you've spent 15 weeks or 14 weeks on you know coming up valuation approaches and pricing I'm going to ask a question as you leave this class and given the experiences you've had with both valuing your company and pricing your company I know it might be a sample size of one you only done it to one company if you had to pick right now which one you trust more which one you will base your decisions on seven to two people pick pricing or I'm sorry valuation over pricing reflecting my biases I guess you know you're reflecting so when they when you leave my room at least in theory you're saying I'm a True Believer in intrinsic valuation it's actually 70 20 70 pick valuation twenty percent big pricing ten percent become Believers in efficient markets are they actually discovered this isn't that easy maybe the Market's not that stupid after all I haven't done a follow-ups interview five years later because many of these people go out and become equity research analysts they become Bankers they become CFOs but five years afterwards I track these people down and ask them exactly the same question now that's been five years since the class and you're doing this number attaching numbers to assets still which one are you using more I'll wage the numbers get switched something seems to happen after you leave this class and you start working that makes you go from being Believers True Believers in intrinsic valuation to Everyday users of pricing so so I started thinking about what might be the reason the first one came to me while I was watching a Seinfeld episode you guys have all what Seinfeld right come on say yes if you live in New York you have to watch it this is a quintessential New York sitcom right so this episode one of Jerry's girlfriends accuses him of being crazy so Jerry you're crazy he says if you think I'm crazy you should see the guy who lives across the hall from me you know who lives across the hall from Jerry a guy called Kramer a guy who's so crazy that relative to him everybody looks same you see why people like pricing if you have to sell something even if somebody trying to sell something very expensive all you have to do is show me something even more expensive say look it's cheap 50 times revenues nothing selling for 100 times revenues your cholesterol is 350. not a problem relative people who died of heart attacks in the last four four two years you look okay I all have to do is pick the right comparables and I can pretty much spend you any story or what we forget how much our valuation is selling right because you value a company because your intellectually curious you're trying to sell it to somebody else and it's easier to sell something with a price than it is with an intrinsic valuation second when you do an intrinsic valuation or insights are out there for everybody to pick apart right so I could say hey why is your Revenue growth so I remember the valuation you sent me I said why is your Revenue growth so high why are margins so high why is your discount rate so low and you got to defend all these assumptions even though some of them you might have completely made up well I have to imagine so I don't know I've had in a good mood I gave them a 35 margin in contrast if you told me I value this company at 12 times ebitdab because that's what the sector is pricing companies that think of how small the target is you don't like 12 times I better take it up at the market in effect in pricing that's basically what I'm saying it's not my fault I am just the messenger here don't shoot the messenger it's much easier to defend a pricing than it is to defend an entrance evaluation you've been to an IPO Roadshow sweat bank has gathered together they go across the country and say Uber is the greatest thing ever you go to the IPO Road show the bankers if they're sensible will never use an entrance evaluation it'll all be about pricing and metrics to convince you that this is the greatest pricing ever so it's easier to sell it's easier to defend and here's the coup de gras I told you I'm a Believer in entrance evaluation but even as a True Believer I think if I'm lucky I'm right 57 times out of a hundred remember you've been 50 times out of 100 you're you're doing you know significantly better than the market but I'm going to be wrong about 43 percent of the time with pricing I think if I'm lucky I might be right 51 of the time even if I bring all the data and statistics 57 beats 51 right I'm right more often than intrinsic evaluation but here's the catch when I'm wrong and intrinsic valuation I'm far more likely to be wrong alone you see why will intrinsic value lead you it'll lead you to companies that other people are fleeing from you're a contrary and you're buying on other people are selling you're selling when other people are buying so when you screw up you're often screwing up hello you know what happens to people who screw up alone they get fired but it's true that's growing up and you're going to screw up make sure you have lots of company you need you see why people are attracted to pricing you look at people why do you buy those companies at 50 times no earnings because everybody else was doing me it's a very effective protection that's why all those.com analysts in the late 90s stayed on as equity research analysts in the next decade right in any just World Barry Mika should never ever be allowed into equity research ever again but if you're doing pricing your argument is everybody was doing it when I first started started teaching this class I used to try to talk people out of price I don't do that anymore because the reality is most of you will end up in jobs that require you to price things if you sit there saying I would only intrinsic valuation you're either going to get fired you're going to be the odd man out in that process so what I'd like to do instead is talk a little bit about why even if you're a True Believer in valuation you need to understand pricing and how to do it right I'm a Believer as I said in valuation but I think it helps me when I value companies to know or understand the pricing process why because ultimately how do I make money when the price adjusts to Value right so if I can understand why people are doing what they're doing I might not agree with them it might give me a basis for at least coming up with the way of saying this is when I should buy a company when it's under that understanding why markets do things can be critical in how you value companies or when you act on those valuations if you're in a job where you're going to get judged against other people doing the same job whether you like it or not you got to be working on Parallel pets you've got to buy undervalued companies but you want to make sure that you're not ending up with the pricing judgment that works so badly against you that you will not survive to the next period ultimately you might be right by the student so let's talk about pricing stocks the price talks as I said you need to standardize prices first is that pretty clear why you need to standardize prices otherwise books or Hathaway is always the most expensive stock in the world and any penny stock looks cheap you can't look at the price per share so every month is basically a standardized press so let's set the table when you look at a multiple and you look at the numerator the numerator will almost always in fact let me take the almost will always have a market number in it that market number can just be the market value of equity market cap it can be market value Equity plus market value of debt which is total value of the firm or could be market value by Equity plus market value of debt minus cash which is called Enterprise Value they're all numbers which are Market sale so the numerator is a market number the denominator is your scalar what you scale that number two and let's look at the choices you can scale market value to revenues why might you want to do that because you're desperate you're comparing 50 money losing companies you can't do earnings you can't do ebitda you keep climbing the income statement until you hit something positive I found a positive number it's my Revenue what if you have pre-revenue companies you're in real trouble now right so then you look for something that might give you revenues like what users downloads you're getting desperate but you need a positive number in the denominator if nothing else works is I divide by the number of cars in the parking lot you need a pricing metric scale to submit so it could be revenues could be drivers of routers it could be earnings right the earnings can be to equity investors which is net income or it could be to all investors which is operating it can be to cash flows for Equity it could be net income plus depreciation or if you want to get really fancy even computer free cash flow to equity for every company which is subtract.net capex and change and working capital bring in debt or if it's to The Firm you can take you can compute free cash to the phone but that's so much work remember the reason people use pricing is why because they're lazy they don't want to do all that work pre-cater for so many items give me a simpler now do you see why ebit does become this ad hoc measure of free cash flow it's kind of neither here nor there but you take ebit you add dice you've got a freak got a cash flow you can divide Market values by what accountants think your company is worth what does that mean you can divide them on you know by Book value of equity because that's what the accountant says your Equity is worth but by invested Capital which is Book value Equity plus book value debt minus cash or even Book value Equity plus book value debt which you can think of as the book value of revenues earnings cash flows a book value so when you look at multiples first thing to do is what are they doing what's in the numerator what's in the denominator get that kind of nail down so I'm going to take you through a four-step process for using pricing and if you're religious about following this process and I'll confess sometimes I'm in a hurry and I don't go through the process I always regret it first step in the process I'm going to start by defining the multiple now this is going to be mildly insulting but hopefully you will absorb the insult and move on so you're saying if I said PE ratio I'm going to Define it what's your reaction I know what a p e ratio is That's So simplistic I'm going to challenge you on that when you talk about PE and I'm talking about P are we talking about the same price earnings ratio so in the process I'm going to set a couple of rules on multiples on that they be consistently defined I'll come back and explain what I mean by that and uniformly estimated which is actually easier to understand because you're going to compare 15 companies you've got to be estimating the same way for all 15 companies you start with the definition of tests second step I'm going to describe the multiple sounds fancy right but I'm going to play Moneyball you seen the movie I'd strongly recommend my favorite movies of all time and especially what's the part with Jonah Hill talks about what he plans to do right because Moneyball is basically the story of Billy Bean who's the general manager for the Oakland days he still lives even though he's never won a World Series he's become a legend and it's about how he deviated from the status quo the status quo in baseball was you listen to Scott said they would have these rules of thought does that sound familiar investing do we have these equivalent people who give you rules of thumb and finally Billy be noticed that all these rules of thumb had long histories but none of them worked so Scout would say this guy is a crooked arm people with crooked arms are very good pitchers I've trust me I know this and after you sign 15 no paid 15 million dollars to get this guy with the Crooked arm it turned out that he had some malfunction in his in his in his elbow and the his elbow blew up so finally he said why are we trusting these guys they have no idea what they're talking about and baseball is a sport more than any other sport that's built on data right every pitch that gets pitched gets recorded every hit that get every walk so he said why didn't we just look at the data to see whether they're delivering the outcome we want which is what baseball what yeah you have to score runs he said who cares what the scouts stick if a guy gets on base by walking all the time guess what he said just as good as somebody gets a basic and that's what Jonah Hill did he went through the data and he basically got you know got the Oakland A's to sign this guy called Kevin youkil is a guy I learned to hate as a Yankee fan when he was playing for the Red Sox it's the god of walks is what he was called because he found a way to actually he had a very good eye and he managed to walk you know 30 of the time what I'm going to do is the equivalent of what you saw in the movie we've been listening to Scouts tell us rules have come and investing all this time but we have this incredible amount of data in front of us what was the place of Moneyball and luckily we don't need Jonah Hill to do this we have the data we have the statistics and I'm going to play some money ball with each of the multiples to talk about so you get a sense of perspective what's high what's low what's typical what's the average what's the median third step in the process is I'm going to analyze the multiple I'm going to take an intrinsic valuation model I know we've moved away from there and I'm going to do some basic algebra and show you what the variables are that driver p e ratio price to book a payout ratio in an intrinsic value word you say why am I going there not because you want to use the same equation but because it tells you the variables you need to control for when you use that multiple to compare across companies Define describe analyze and only that am I going to apply you know what the problem pricing is people are in such a hurry to apply a multiple they don't want to go through the first three steps so let's start with the first question look at a multiple first question I ask is it consistently defined let me explain what the test is remember I said every multiple is a numerator in a denominator here's a simple rule if the numerator is an equity value the denominator has to be an equity value too if the numerator is a firm or an Enterprise Value the denominator has to be a firm or an Enterprise Value as well no idea what I'm talking about right let me pick up my price earnings ratio what's in the numerator Equity value firm value Enterprise Value Equity value price per share market cap earnings per share Equity value firm value Enterprise Value thank God for small blessings the most wideliest multiple in the world is okay e ratios are okay what about Evita what's in the numerator market value of the operating asset that's basically what you're supposed to be getting with the Enterprise Value in the denominator of a measure of operating cash for a very rough pre-tax pre-capex measure EB to advertise okay as well what about price to ebitda it's a horrific multiple the analyst invented they should be Todd feathered and driven out of the fraternity what existed you know Bloomberg used to report a price to Epitaph for every company I pointed out that this was a horrific I might have used exactly that word seems to have disappeared now but if I went back because 550 I quoted research reports 10 of them use price to have it down it's symmetric one of them happened to be somebody who'd gone through this class A few years earlier so I called the guy and he said Remember the evaluation class you took a few years ago he said vaguely I said it shows I said what the heck are you doing dividing Christ by Abita it's not consistent he said no no I'm being consistent so what do you mean you're being consistent he said I use price to have it down for all 15 companies in my sector I said it's a very strange definition of consistency could have you been noticing that companies with a lot of debt in your sec to keep looking cheap to you you say yeah yeah but I said have you ever stopped and wondered why that might be happening do you see why when you use price to have a heavily levered companies always going to look cheaper because what's in your numerator market cap just the equity portion so if I borrow money and buy back stock and reduce My Equity my numerator goes down but in my denominator is earning before interest taxes depreciation amortization that's going to stay the same as I borrow money before you feel too Superior to this guy if you ever use price to sales you're guilty of the same sin right market cap and revenues you know why people get away with it what are the sectors or sector where you see price to sales use the most technology and why do you get away with it because they tend not to have debt you got lucky okay the other is retail and even there it's shaken out used to work because everybody at roughly they're all at least commitments they're all at debt mismatch is a recipe for disaster so that's the first topic make sure your multiple is consistently defined second it's going to be uniformly estimated if you want to compare this across 15 companies let's say it's PE ratios earnings per share should be estimated the same way for all 15. I used to think this was a slam duck in markets like the us because you'd one set of accounting principles right this Gap and what we've discovered especially over the last two decades is you can have the same accounting rules covered in 20 companies but different degrees of fidelity to those rooms in other words you don't even have to break the rule you can push the limits of the rule and if you're conservative as a company you report lower earnings and if you're aggressive using the same rules you can report higher earnings which is one reason about 15 years ago has simply actually created a database where they take reported earnings and actually clean up for items that they felt were being miscategorized to try to come up with consistent earnings they gave up on it the demand was just not there but there's this company called new constructs if you get a chance they're on online they actually try to do this with companies it's cleanup earnings so we get a number that's actually comparable across completion is it consistently defined is it uniformly estimated so let's do the let's try this on a few models it's a p ratio most widely used multiple in the world everybody knows how to compute a p ratio even Anaconda cover seem to know remember most of you don't remember she Mass created as a tennis player for like 10 years with Washington why masqueradish never won anything but she was on every commercial she was like a Maria Sharapova without the doubt so this is in 2001 and 2002 there's a Charles Schwab commercial Anna konikovas playing somebody must have been an actress she was actually winning and 10 is every two games you got to switch sides because you don't want the sun in your eye or wrong side of the chord so they're switching sides in the middle of matching whatever reason Anna turns to whoever she's playing and says price earnings ratios price divided by earnings per share why this would come up in the middle of a tennis match I don't know but I remember turning the TV off saying is that all it is does anaconda would really know what the period She kept going she said something about preferred dividends it went completely over my head okay let's let's break it apart what's in the numerator of the p ratio usually the price per share unless you've got one of those technical analysts gone crazy you know what they like to do they like to smooth out everything they take an average price across time to which my responses have you ever tried buying a stock at a moving average price it never works numerate is usually the current price it's the denominator that you get the variations right I divide by earnings per share but their earnings per share can be from the most recent fiscal year which is called current PE it can be earnings per share from the most recent four quarters which is called trailing PE it can be earnings per share from the next four quarters which would be forward PE or be earnings per share from the year 2030 which is really really forward p it's like why would I do that desperation again you're the biotech analyst you've got 35 companies near Sector 33 are losing money and PE ratio is the only tool you know how to use guess what you do you project out the earnings for every company and he said this company is cheap it's trading at eight times twenty Thirty earnings so what what am I supposed to do with it but before you can even think through if so if you bought the stock because eight sounds low right remember the more forward you've got the lower the number is going to get because you're dividing the price today by an earnings per share in a future year it could be earnings before extraordinary items after extraordinary items it can be only before stock based compensation after stock basically you see where I'm going right if and I remember about seven years ago I sat down with Cisco widely followed stock estimated 34 different p e ratios for the company at one point in time depending on different definitions of earnings per share ranging from I think you know 14 at the low to 60 at the High which one am I going to use depends on what I'm trying to do if I'm trying to sell you Cisco guess which number I'll let you do Cisco is cheap it rates at for T times earnings if I want to show you Cisco's expensive the next time you see it this is one of the funniest things to see on cnpc is two analysts with differing views of a stock both using price earnings ratios but they can't even agree what the p e ratio is the bullish analyst always use forward earnings and the bearish handles use trailing earnings not that one is right the other is wrong but because it serves their story better so P ratios are consistent but you can see variations but there's one aspect of PE ratios where I think life has become a lot more difficult over the last four years how do you get earnings per share you take net income and divide by share count right but think about what's happened as companies increasingly have gone to stock based compensation you have a primary share count and then you have a partially diluted check card we can't only options if they're in the money or a fully diluted share card where you count in all options obviously going to be different with each definition so let's say you're looking at a sector where there's big variations in how much stock based compensation gets used by different companies and let's say they use options are any of those three approaches or or let me rephrase it with each of those three approaches am I going to get biased let's start with primary earnings per share if I use PE where I divide by the actual number of shares and I'm ignoring all the options that are out there and I'm comparing across companies what kinds of companies are going to look cheap to me companies a lot of options outstanding are not very many and tell me why when you have a lot of options what's market doing in other words market cap reflects the fact that I have tens of millions of options so it's going to be lower but because I'm dividing by the primary earnings per share this stock is going to look cheap because I'm not factoring in the reality that there are 100 million options overhanging so with primary earnings per share I'm going to bias myself against companies which have very few options and towards companies if I use diluted fully diluted earnings I'm going to go in the other direction I'm counting all these options I'm in the money some out of the money I'm counting as they're all chairs I'm going to bias myself towards companies that have no options at all and would partially diluted I fought somewhere in the middle and now I'm so none of these really are going to and but we do this all the time right so if I wanted to get a truly consistent measure of PE ratio for technology companies and I worry about these options outstanding what should I really be doing if I if my end game was to get a p ratio that actually meant something so using the market cap a share price times number of shares you know what I should be doing I should be taking share price times number of shares to get market cap but all those options have an equity value right can we estimate what that Equity value is you did it for quiz too what did you attach an option pricing model it'll never happen trust me this will never happen it's too much work no analyst is ever going to do it but if you truly wanted something that was comparable across companies we should be using not the market cap but the market cap plus the value of the equity options outstanding and including all the restricted stock because that is the true value of everything let's talk about evidence anybody here from an equity research background no I did it over to someone okay and what sector did you work in uh did you use EB debit test uh yes okay that's the price I'm going to make you I'm going to let you be the Arbiter of EV to have it does here because I trust me you will be able to to answer the question if you think about what you're trying to do so it's EV debit cards market value Equity plus debt supposed to be a market value of debt but what do we usually do we use Book value which we get away with until we run into a problem with distressed companies but in theory it should be market value debt minus cash right we use Net10 so I've asked this question of hundreds of owners who use EB debit I seldom get the right answer maybe you can give me what the answer is why do we net cash out of the numerator already has a value and it's we shouldn't we don't need to value that that what if I let's suppose one of your assets as a certain should I take out the value of every asset but I feel pretty certain about the value then he does just one to one there is no like risk associated you see even I don't think even you are convinced with your own reasoning right because ultimately I still get the cash I buy Apple whether it's certain or not it belongs to me and it looks like I'm not counting it I'll give you a clue what did we say consistency right look at the denominator what's in the denominator yeah what is the interesting come from that's your answer right because my denominator does not include the income from cash I have to take it out of the numerator and I've opened the Pandora's book in addition to netting out cash what else do I need to be net out of the numerator what other assets do companies own whose income doesn't show up as part of epitaph or cross Holdings and other companies you see how when I look at a charter Motors and I'm getting 30 my value if I'm doing Enterprise Value to ebitda right now I want consistent answers I need to be netting out cash and I'm going to be netting out minority Holdings never a majority Holdings God help me because now I have a real problem right my ebitda is a Consolidated Epitaph where I counted a hundred percent of the subsidiary but I own only 60 percent so to get consistency you know what I need to do I need to bring in the 40 into the numerator that doesn't belong to me just to be consistent and how do most of the most analysts do it they add the minority interest to the numerator and the reason it's half-assed is minority interest is Book value right so they're taking a book value of minority interest and adding into cash so basically their reasoning is good but you can already see that getting consistency with EB debit means dealing with cross sortics so if you are running away from intrinsic valuation because that cross-olding section freaked you out guess what it's chasing you down when you're doing pricing it's always going to be something you deal with one final question about consistency and this is actually an interesting question about how do you detect if there's a bubble in housing right because most housing you know it's very difficult to tell when when there's a book so I'll tell you one metric that people look at they look at what you pay for a house and they look at what you make us rental income and they look for mismatches but let's suppose you're trying to decide whether to invest your money in equities in the stock market and housing and you're trying to come up with something that you know so you've taken the house price and you're dividing by rent to come up with the ratio for housing what is the equivalent multiple I'd look at the equity Market to decide whether Equity was cheaper or more expensive so you're trying to be consistent so I'm taking the housing price first housing price is closer to market cap as you close an Enterprise Value did you pay for the entire house usually not right he borrowed money but I'm counting the entire housing price so it is an Enterprise it's closer to the Enterprise that and then the denominator becomes what is rental income like it's like is it like revenue is it like operating income it's probably Revenue but the expenses you have are you know are really the operating expenses you have are small you can't count interest expect because that will make it into an equity income so if you think about maintenance expenses maybe they'll take I think you could probably get away using an Enterprise Value to revenue multiplicity comparison but if you really wanted to say this is really operating income and you want to go with EV to Abbott I can live with that as well but my point is you want to compare across asset classes you have to think about am I comparing Apples to Apples because otherwise I can come up with the wrong conclusions about NASA class so I let you think about it if I have housing price to rental income you know a rental income would be what I make if I rented this outside what is the amount the the analogy I would use in the equity Market to make a comparison as to whether equities are cheaper than housing and maybe can no you can I I'll try it out in the S P 500 using you know what what I know about housing presidential income now but I mean interesting comparison to see across assets so definition of tests let's move on to the descriptive test you look at P ratios no 60 years ago if I asked what do the PE ratios look like across the sector was a huge amount of work right you had to go collect it I know I've been nagging you about s p Capital IQ all through and many of you have never accessed it and to Value an individual company you really don't need it that much right because would you depend on financial statements but when you do pricing having access to a database like s p Capital like you becomes immensely useful I can now pull up the P ratios for not just every company in your sector in this market but across the globe I can pull back P ratios for the last 20 years for every company the data is there but when you look at data you want you can't just look at 60 companies over 20 years you got to compress the data summarize the data so start with the standard summary statistic what's the average what's the standard deviation but this is where having distributions can help you drawing a distribution because that makes you think is it symmetric is it asymmetric is it normal is it abnormal because that'll tell you a lot more about how this multiple you're not interested for statistical reasons it's about how do I use a smarter so as I said one of the things I do in the first week of the year when I collect data on every publicly traded companies is I compute every conceivable multiple I can for every company PE ratio Price to Book Eve it says the data is already that looks like a lot of work but once I've got the I don't actually use Capital IQs P ratios Price to Book EB debit diabetes you know why not because they're necessarily wrong but I don't know what they're doing with cross sortings I don't know what they're doing with Goodwill I don't know what they're including in earnings per share you know so I want to make sure that I control the numerator denominator and my advice to you is when you're going to compute multiples do it to yourself This is one number divided by another number why do you have to have Capital like you do it for you it doesn't save you any time so download the market cap and the net income of every company and do your own PE ratio it might match up or might not match up but at least you know what goes into your mother so this is what the distribution of P ratios look like for U.S companies at the start of 2023 so remember what I said about asymmetry you look at the distribution you can see exactly what I'm talking about Peak to the left tail to the right why because the p e ratio cannot be lower than zero it can potentially be a very high number in fact I've arbitrarily made the tail less because I've said everything above 100 but if I kept going it would keep going and to show you how this plays out in terms of statistics here's what the numbers look like when I computed the summary statistics first let me start at the Top Line there were 7165 companies in myself that's every publicly traded company in the US but I seem to have lost about 4 000 companies just Computing PE ratio what happened there were negative earnings he said 2022 must have been a terrible year 2022 was not it was actually pretty this happens every single year I've been doing this since 1992 I lose about 60 of my sample every year some years like 2009 can be up as high as 70 percent because you have money losing companies you think so what I still have 3 000 companies is there a potential bias that you get when you remove companies in your sample what kinds of companies am I losing probably younger companies risky companies smaller companies something to think about when you see an average computed across B ratios deals would be average across the companies that actually survive NABA earnings that might not be the PE Ratio you want to report for the sector because there are all these other companies I've struggled with this for the last 30 years because I compute averages by sector and when I first started doing this I used to compute the average across the companies that had PE ratios and I very quickly realized that I was getting numbers that didn't capture so if I took biotechnology at 35 companies and only three of them had made money I completed the average pay across the three companies and that doesn't make any sense right so is there a way out of this is there because no clearly you don't want to create biased averages so maybe you can give me a better way of doing this I'll tell you what I do but maybe I you know I'll open up for suggestions how do you deal with this loss of sample of bias that comes from the fact that I'm throwing out money losing companies there are two ways at least I can think of doing it see if you can come up with a third way or maybe one of the two you want to try I'm sorry but I still need a positive number in the denominator right so even if I I don't see how that would solve the problem in terms of bringing the because basically I want to get the information the 32 companies that I threw out to not leave the data because there is information there I'll tell you what I do I add up the market cap of every company in the sector including the money losing companies I take the aggregated market cap by the aggregated net income it's like a weighted average of the PE ratios But it includes the companies that are money losing in there yeah what if you average the earnings that is the other response because the reason PE ratios you have to throw at negative earnings companies isn't to continue right what's a Continuum low p ratio is BET is is better as for an investor than a high p e ratio right but when your P ratios become negative they're actually more like a very high PE ratio so the probability ratios is because that Continuum gets broken you have to throw out negative earnings companies but if you use earnings to price ratios Nothing Stops you from having a negative earnings price ratio that's worse than having a positive earnings price ratio and essentially you get a Continuum that works so one reason for using earnings yields into a p e ratios is you no longer have to throw away money losing companies so those are the two that I've come up with but if you could come up with a creative Third Way of not throwing away money losing companies I'd be interested in learning because it's something I you know every startup every year right as well is there a better way of doing this I do report the median P of the companies that have PE ratios but I also report the aggregated number because I think that has more value thinking about how our sectors being priced my average P for U.S companies at the start of 2023 was 109.25 it's mind-boggling right but before it freaks you out the immediate P at the start of 2023 was 13.92 what does that mean half of all companies with PE ratios trade at less than 13.92 it's a that's a huge difference between the average in the media and the culprit is right here there's actually one company the PE Ratio 0.05 you know what probably happened to it right the earnings still reflects a trailing 12-month earnings and you have the Silicon Valley Bank kind of collapse in the price the price today has gone to almost zero but the earnings are still kind of lagging so don't be don't go out there put all your money the 0.05ps I think that's an incredible bargain my guess is this is the Calm before the storm for the whole company blows up there's a higher speed ratio 86 000 for it incidentally as I go from current P to trailing p and remember when I did this there was a Divergence right current PA computed the start of January 2023 was based upon probably 2021 numbers because that was the most recent year and the trailing PE was through September of 2022. for most of you current trailing P are going to converge there's a there's this moment of Grace at the start of the Year probably March April but current trailing PE converge and then they will diverge again so trailing p I have about 3097 almost the same as current B but then when I go to forward P I lose another 600 companies why pretty extra 600 companies being lost what do I need for four would be I need next year's earnings per share there's no way I'm estimating on Express share for 7165 company so you know what I look for an analyst estimate of earnings per share next year which capital IQ gives but only for those companies that are followed by animals we create bias in the strangest Ways by the choices we make so when you use forward PS whether you like it or not you're already looking at a subset of your companies perhaps it's a subset you want to look at but perhaps it's not so when you talk about description that's basically what you look for what can I learn from the data so from until about 2004 I used to do this just for U.S companies not because I was parochial but because the raw data I had actually came from value line I didn't have kid there's no Capital IQ there's no and I do just U.S companies and in 2005 I started using Bloomberg terrible to get data from because it's not structured for research to get data for other companies and the reason I did that is a I got sick and tired of taking this graph that I had from the US to Sao Paulo or Mumbai and some grizzled animals would put up his hand say it doesn't look anything like that here I said anything like what where okay I don't think Brazilian stocks have the stale to the right and Peak to the left he said how do you know gut feeling I don't trust your gut so 2005 decided to check their gut so I started doing this across all companies so today I do this for 47 000 publicly traded companies and I create this chart simply again to get perspective so basically in this I have a chart for three three groups a cup U.S companies Emerging Market companies global company so if you look at those three charts which I'm sorry to the left there to the right right doesn't mean everybody has the same p ratio so break down P ratios by region and I want to look at those P ratios and tell me whether there's things you can learn about if I am a naive analyst and say I'm going to go where the PE Ratio is lowest you know where all my money's going oh Eastern Europe and Russia looks really cheap maybe Canadians don't ask me what okay Canadian stocks so if you look at those two one you're surprised by right Canadian stocks the other you shouldn't be Eastern Europe and Russia have low P ratios why it's risk it's incredibly risky Canada who knows there's Canadians through strange things but it's actually I'll tell you what the reason was it's natural resource companies and after really good years Canadian stocks have really low PE ratios because the market prices these companies on Cycles in fact if you look at Price to Book ratios you see the same kind of phenomena look at the median the markets that have the lowest Price to Book or the region that have the lowest price democratios are mostly Latin America or mostly Emerging Markets Africa Eastern Europe there's again one New Market that you don't expect to see the Japanese Snokes Japanese stocks for the last 30 years have always had among the lowest price to book ratios to any group and it's not because they're cheap it's because Japanese accounting allows for all these Provisions to get built up which pushes are Book value it's an accounting effect that's playing so it's actually interesting to look at multiples across because in today's day and age we're often comparing PE ratios to Japanese companies to us companies we are casual about it you might decide a Price to Book ratios you might decide to buy a Japanese stock thinking is cheap without factoring in the accounting reasons why it looks cheap and finally one reason I like to have these distributions play Moneyball is I get sick and tired of rules of them six times I have a death sheet you know how many times I've been told that when I'm in a panel I now refuse to be on panels brain it's mind-numbing to be on a panel sometimes the PE guy said what is this DCF stuff you do we know how to find a cheap stock it's six times habitat okay how do you come up with that maybe some drug guy the late 70s leaving his Wall Street office saying you know what from this day on six times if it does cheap and it gets passed on generation to generation so here's the simplest way to push back against rules of thumb I remember in 2010 somebody came into my office in 2011. came to my office six times advertised sheet I said wait wait just a moment I have to do something it turned in and I did a histogram I actually had the histogram what the histogram looked like for U.S companies half of all U.S companies traded at less than six times every time how can it be cheap if half of all companies do it could six times habit that'd be cheap in 2023 unless you happen to be in Japan do you see where I'm going having these absolute rules of thumb is kind of absurd because the numbers change underneath your tier they change across markets so if you wanted to create a rule of thumb that was actually data Centric rather than pick six times ebitda if you want to stay with the data and say I want to find cheap stocks what should you define as cheap pick a percent up 20th percentile 25th percentile and say that's my measure of cheap is I'm going to look at the first quartile any company that trades at less than so in 2023 you ask me what's cheap I'm going to look at the 25th percentile and you can see that what's cheap actually varies widely across markets depending on what part of the world you're in I can understand the 1970s drunk guy making up six times every day he didn't have to date he didn't have the data to look at today we have no excuse but think of how we still hang on with rules of thumb that have lost their entire basis because let's become conventional wisdom PEG ratio less than one is cheap no that's again widely used practice actually and I'll show you the graph of Peg ratios very quickly because that doesn't look cheap to me so Define describe next session when we start I'm going to give you a very simple device to analyze some multiple we could look behind and think of it as lifting the hood of a car and looking at what what what the engine looks like you're looking at the inside of a monkey and you're doing it not because you care about yeah because you know what questions to ask when it stops working when something looks cheap you know what questions to ask so next session when we start I'm going to give you a trick you can use to come up with those questions and variables and use them then on actual PE ratios to see if we can detect with with something is really cheap as opposed to just looking to you so I will see you on Monday thank you 
foreign thank you okay um this Thursday I'll send you a to-do list on what's left on your project and really there's not that much but I want you to have a sense of here's what needs to get done because especially as you get to next towards the end of next week and the week after things are going to hit you and lots of different fronts not just in this class but in every class but uh you know if you can get that to-do list done you're pretty much done with your project you can set it to the side there's not that much group work involved in this project you know and that was intentional I wanted much of this project to be individual partly because you guys are sick of each other I mean let's face it your second year mbas you haven't got enough time you know you know if you've had your shares group work you know so this is more individual at some point you'll have to get together as a group to bring things together for a report but it's really bringing together four different valuations and adding a cover page so a lot of this is is in your control if you have time get it out of the way so I'll send you that to-do list So today we're going to continue answering and I want to talk about how in pricing and we might have mentioned this already but I want to get this nailed down the essence of pricing is you're looking for mismatches what does that mean you want to look for things that are cheap that don't deserve to be cheap okay so I'm going to start with a very simple test and I've kind of mentioned this already in class so let's get this nailed out you want to find a cheap stock for your portfolio you don't want to go through this undervaluation thing too much work you want to do pricing if Capital like you so first thing you run is you look for a company with a low p e ratios let's get the nail done so that's the first thing so here's the rest of it I'm going to give you each of the other variables and I want you to think about what you would look for in a mismatch you have low p on growth you want low growth high growth you want high growth because low growth would explain it away so low P high growth on risk low risk high risk no risk low P high growth low risk and finally remember that growth is can be high quality or low quality so do you want low return Equity or a high return equity you now have a template for screening I mean this is what 95 of portfolio management has become is screening through big databases for which stocks should we buy you have the template if you get a chance you know this evening get on s p Capital IQ you can run these screens in three minutes you can find and then you have to ask yourself this is what I'm doing as a portfolio manager why should I get an excess return right 50 years ago doing this might have involved a lot of work but now it's almost effortless but you at least have the template for thinking through what makes things talk to you we're also today going to talk about Revenue multiple so they said Revenue multiples are often used by people because they're desperate earnings are negative appetized negative we keep climbing the income statement the revenue is the first positive number you're in but you're looking at Revenue multiples in a sector where they've historically been used more widely retail and you are being naive you're picking stocks based on low multiples of Enterprise Value to sales consistent multiple if you don't control for differences which of these companies are lucky keyword is look cheap to you on an EB to sales basis department stores this country tell us luxury retailers nobody said discount stores why what is it about discount stores that lead them to have lower multiple superiorities and what's the what's a variable so let's say you're running an s p Capital IQ screen so you're going to have low Enterprise Value so what's the variable that you might want to then screen for to capture the differences across these three in this case some measure of margin right not net margin because that's an equity margin operating margin so I would say operating margin may be even gross margin but operating margin would make the most sense the sectors that look cheap on an EB to sales basis will tend to be low margin businesses I'll leave it up to you to construct the mismatch when it comes to then Revenue multiples you want low multiple of revenues you want High margins because otherwise you explain away and then all of the other variables growth and risk and reinvestment would play out in exactly the same way one final point we're going to get a chance as we talk about Enterprise Value to sales we're going to talk about valuing brand names accountants have jumped onto the bandwagon they're all over the place but I want you to focus your attention on what it is that creates value in a branding I've kind of mentioned this at the very start of the class but I thought a picture would bring home the message much more directly so yesterday I went on the CBS website and I looked up aspirin not that I want it but you know I just want to see what so I found a bare aspirin 8.69 and CBS aspirin I made sure they won't coded otherwise you'd compare them one one is quoted the other is not 869 versus 429. for exactly the same product right aspirin is aspirin you're not going to reinvent it that's the power of a brand name today we're going to talk about quantifying that effect and value how do we bring that into value how much of the value Coca-Cola comes from brand name so maybe the EB to sales template will give us a way to do that so we have lots on our agenda let's turn back to I think we were on Slide 19. and see how we come up with these variables to control for the mismatches so when you look at a multiple p e ratio e b to have beta e b to sales there are two questions you want to to address an answer first is what are the variables what are the fundamentals that drive this multiple yeah so when you look at a multiple what what do we know is it growth is it cash flow is it return actually so first you could look because behind every multiple as I mentioned right at the start of this discussion there are assumptions you're making about cash flows growth and risk you want to kind of extract those second you need to tell me how as that variable changes your multiple will change I'll give you an example as growth increases what should happen to be it should go up right that's the easy part but if that's all you bring to the table it's going to be very difficult for you to compare across companies because if we give you 10 companies with different growth rates let's say they all fall in the right direction the PE for the higher growth companies is higher than the P for the lower growth companies you still have to make a judgment on how high is too high so not only do you need to tell me what the variables are that drive the multiple you need to also get a sense of the Dynamics of if growth doubles for a company will the p e ratio also double will it go by 50 60 because without doing it you can't price companies and I'm going to give you a template a very simple way in which you can back out not only what the variables are but get a sense at least of how those variables change your multiple will change so here's what I would like you to do so let's say I'm an analyst I come to you with a multiple you've never seen that multiple before you don't understand what it is it's either going to be an equity multiple like PE ratio Price to Book or it's going to be an Enterprise Value model if it's an equity multiple step away from using it for the moment and go back to the simplest Equity valuation model you could think of I'll tell you the simplest one that comes to mind a stable growth dividend discount model it can't get any simpler than that right expected dividend by cost of equity minus growth why simplest because this is going to test your algebra skills and I know they've become Rusty since seventh grade or eighth grade or whenever you use so let's say you take you're saying but I'm doing pricing why am I going to go back to a dividend discount model with a little bit of algebra and I'm going to show this with the PE Ratio you can take that discounted cash flow model and make it a model to act to estimate what the PE ratio for a company should be or The Price to Book ratio and in the process of doing that you can say these are the variables that drive this month so with that Equity multiple go back to the simplest Equity valuation model you can think of do the algebra see what the where what the model would look like to try to explain that model with an Enterprise Value multiple go back to the simplest Enterprise value equation you can think of again a stable growth free cash for the firm next year divided by cost to Capital minus the growth rate again go through the algebra and you can tell me what the variables are that drive that multiple I know it sounds incredibly abstract but let's try this out on a PE ratio simplest model is there's a stable growth dividend discount model expected dividend next year divided by cost of equity minus the growth rate so the r there is the cost of equity I know okay this is harking back to algebra in sixth grade but if I have an equation I divide both sides of the equation by a constant it remains an equation right so what if I divide both sides of the equation by the earnings per share price divided by earnings per share gives me p e ratio what's dividends divided by earnings for sure dividends push that's payout ratio you think why is there a one plus G because I need it for next year I've essentially taken a stable growth dividend discount model and stated in terms of p ratio think of this as an intrinsic value equation for getting the p ratio you never use this we are actually using PE ratios because you're pricing things but this is if I gave you a discarded cash flow monster tell me what the p e ratio for a company should be that's what the PE Ratio would look like now of course the problem with dividends is managers set them and managers might overpair underpay in the context of equity valuation we said you can estimate the potential dividend the free cash flow to equity so if you want to replace the payout ratio with the free cash flow Equity this model Works still with free cash or equity it's of course a stable growth model it's designed for mature companies but at least for mature companies now you have a structure for explaining what the p e ratio for that company should be again you will never use this model but if you look at that equation that already tells you the variables that drive the p e ratio right it's driven by the payout ratio the cost of equity and the growth rate those variables are why we run these equations to get a sense of I mean the way I think about it is you want to have the tools to ask the right questions so when I say what no I'm trying to sell you a stock with a low p e ratio first question you're going to ask me is what's a payout ratio the analysis or return Equity because it gives you the same answer what's your cost of equity risk what's your growth rate that's basically what you get out of running this equation now of course many of you are pricing companies which have dropped right five ten percent fifteen percent twenty percent say can I do this when I have high growth you can but the equation gets Messier so I'm going to do it once and not return to it but if you ask me to value a company with high growth with the dividend discount model I can actually write the value of a stock as a sum of two numbers one is the present value of dividends during the high growth phase that's what the first term in the equation is and the second is the terminal value so basically I've taken what we do in an Excel spreadsheet and written as an equation that's the value of my stock with a two-stage dividend discount mod okay if I divide both sides of that equation by the earnings per share I end up with a p e ratio for a high Growth Company and guess what it's determined by payout ratio cost of equity and growth rate the only difference is you now have to estimate it twice the variables that drive a multiple don't change as you add growth faces to it you just have to estimate them more times that's why I said after this I'm not going to go back to a two-stage model because once you do a stable growth model you have the variables already so why make the algebra Messier for yourself but I'm going to use this two-stage model to talk a little bit about why p e ratios vary across companies and why they change over time so I'm going to start by setting up a hypothetical example of a company in Highcroft so these numbers are completely made up so hang it there as they are it's got an expected growth rate of 15 for the next five years and one and a half percent after that its payout ratio is 25 right now low because it wants to grow fast and 92.5 afterwards its beta is let's put for just keep things simple I'm keeping it the same in both bits but I could have let them change as well so it's a high growth company with five years of growth of 15 . let's suppose the question I asked you was on an intrinsic basis what multiple of earnings should this company trade at I'm just going to go back and plug in the numbers into the equation you saw on the previous page 25 payout ratio 15 growth rate yeah six and a half percent is your cost of equity basically because you put the risk-free rate plus beta times risk premium six and a half percent cost of equity but you plug the numbers in and again this is the present value of dividends in the first period present value of the terminal price my PE ratio is 29.15 sounds high right but why is it so high because my risk free rate is low my cost of equity is low so when you look at this company as a high Growth Company you say 29.15 that sounds like a high earnings in this case that would have been a justifiable PE ratio with a risk-free rate of one and a half percent and an equity was between five percent that was 2022 right you take the same company and you put a four percent risk free rate holding everything else to say what's going to happen to the intrinsic PE ratio it's going to drop to about 18. it's going to have a significant effect on the p e ratio so one of the things that's nice about this is I can play what-if questions right what if interest rates go up what if the growth rate declines and the first table that's exactly what I did I changed the discrete rate from one and a half percent down to zero percent which is what it was in Europe or all the way up to six percent you can already see that for every given growth rate in my case fifteen percent my PE ratio drops from 33 to 19. as my risk pre-rate changes the higher risk free rates lead lower P ratios a little later in this class I'm going to talk about one of the traps that a lot of value investors fell into is they compared PE ratios across time and during the last decade they stayed out of stocks you know why because the PE ratio of stocks look too high but there's a very simple explanation for why they were high it's because risk-free rates were at historic lows I also buried the growth rate now again give me a sense of intuition if I have a 15 Growth Company and you wake up tomorrow and you discover the growth is going to be only five percent sort of 15 it's a negative surprise right what's going to happen to your PE ratio it's going to decrease and that happens across the board but look at the effect on your p e ratio and interest rates are low as opposed to interest rates being high when interest rates are very high the effect of changing your growth rate on your PE ratio becomes much smaller back here I stopped at six percent we go to ten fifteen twenty percent interest rates the effect of a surprise on growth is much smaller when interest rates are low that same surprise on growth has a much bigger impact he's like how would I get surprised by growth you know the mechanism by which the surprise is delivered you've invest in a high Growth Company how do you wake up to the realization of what is it that wakes you up to the realization maybe you're screwed up it's usually an earnings report right the company comes out of the earnings report and said hey guys we told you we're going to grow at 15 but you know what three percent is what it looks like you get a second to assess that and then you got to lower the price and you can see as my growth declines my p e ratios Decline and my growth goes up my PE ratios increase over the last decade earning surprises evoke much bigger price reactions than they used to and people looked and say that must mean the market is getting more irrational that's not necessarily true right because when you have low risk free rates it's exactly what you should anticipate can somebody give me the intuition as to why your PE ratios become less sensitive to growth as interest rates get higher and higher what's the value of growth it's all in the future right let's take an extreme example let's suppose risk-free rates rise to a thousand percent you're in hyperinflation how much has grown so let's say you're 15 growth how much is that growth worth with a thousand percent but nothing what if I surprise you and said look I'm gonna have twenty percent growth reaction is it's still nothing as risk-free rates rise the value of growth becomes a smaller and smaller component of value care less and less about surprises because you are invaluated in the first place the last decade that was the downside is as risk-free rates got lower stocks had to become more volatile because more of the value came from growth for every company even mature companies and surprises about growth had much more consequence so when you look at how stocks are behaving Now versus even two years ago one thing to factor in is with higher risk free rates you should expect to see smaller reactions to earning surprises than you did two years ago simply because the value of growth has become lower for every company across the board any questions on growth surprises appears now that I was asking what if questions the second word of question I asked was Hey what if I used to beta one right what if I'd used a beta that was higher or low again the obvious effect kicks in as my Beta gets higher holding all it's constant my PE ratios get lower as you go across right so you go from low beta to high beta my P ratios get up and that's true where they have five percent growth seven percent growth ten percent growth 15 growth of 50 growth for every company for every beta or every growth rate the higher the risk in your company the lower the PE ratio so remember we talked about screening one way to think about Superstar companies the Superstar companies have a combination of low risk and high growth they traded insanely high PE ratios because you're getting the best of both combinations if you look at the other end I'll call these investment dogs you have companies high risk and low growth who wants that but to the extent they exist you're going to price them in if you go for stocks with low p e ratios and that's your only criteria I'm going to buy low PE stocks guess which ones you're going to load up your portfolio with I'm going to have a lot of investment dogs in your portfolio companies that look cheap but are actually this combination of high risk and but let's say you're a CEO of a company and you have both high risk and high growth and you won't increase your PE ratio so right now you're one working in your favor one working age there are two strategies you can adopt one is you can try to grow faster right and many CEOs go that route because if you're in a growth company that's all you think about how can I grow faster how can I grow faster but there's another strategy which is rather than go for more growth you could try to reduce the risk in your company and you know what especially as you get to high growth high risk companies the payoff from reducing risk is going to be far greater than the payoff from focusing on an extra one percent or two percent of three percent of growth yes how do we find out what's the optimum English what did you like as if you're a company what would you like your PE ratio to be yeah so there is no option right you are the highest possible PE ratio in a good way right that's exactly what the effect you want the higher the p ratio what happens to the stock price but if that's the case then when companies like in one of the earlier lectures into like Microsoft ipu or Christopher but you are the highest price you can get an IPO high prices can never hurt you as a company but the problem is once you've set that those expectations what you worry about how do you get a high PE because you have this high growth and low risk and if either of those shifts then the p e ratio is going to drop so you have to be careful that you haven't set an expectations you can't deliver on so if you as a company go out and convince everybody that you have high growth and low risk that is not and that is not the truth eventually it's going to come back to bite you so there is no Optimum p ratio but you want to get the highest price you can given your true fundamentals you don't want to oversell your company on Dimensions that that are not true right to reduce your risk you uh with with us find a different set you could but there will be a consequence right what are the sectors with the lowest risk so how would you do how would you reduce a feature if you're not doing that well let's take software companies right what is what's a trend across software companies we saw for the last decade they started as updates so basically even Microsoft the way they made money is you came up with a new version then you wanted people to upgrade so you lived upgrade to upgrade increasingly what did they shift away towards they shifted towards subscription base I'm an adobe and a Microsoft subscriber I'm on annual subscriptions on both because I don't think even think I can get an update an individual software anymore what's the advantage of doing that we know subscription-based revenues are more stable than update based Revenue so you're less you know you're less dependent on people doing the updates and good times and not doing it in bad times so one is changing towards a different business model might make you less risky the trade-off then might be you might have to settle for slightly lower growth and a subscription-based model than you do on an update based model but you're doing the trade-off of saying I'm going to go for Less risk even though I might be giving up a percent or two of growth over time because I don't get these you know searching up so that's the kind of trade-off that that sometimes growth companies have to make is something that makes your revenues most stable it's not videos no but not if you're smoothing it out during because remember updates used to increase during you know where the economy was doing well companies were doing well so you used to get these surges and updates not at random intervals but related to what the economy was doing so to the extent that these updates are happening and they're linked to macro variables you're making yourself less susceptible to those macro variables with a subscription-based model okay you're right if it's only firm specific it's not going to do much good for you but to the extent that a lot of stuff you're doing is also smoothing things out you know as a even as a macro economy ships you are making yourself a less risky company yes um no it's just because present value effects a pure present value effect right what's the value of growth it's a present value of future cash flows so as interest rates go up the value of growth for every company becomes a smaller percentage of its current value right so if you think about what you pay for a stock some of it comes from existing cash flows some of it comes from growth and with very high interest rates the value of future growth becomes a smaller percentage and that's true across companies and that's why I said think in extreme terms what happens if risk free rates go to a thousand percent the value growth goes to zero surprising you about growth you say I don't care right so it's good to often take things to The Logical limit but actually this is a good tool to have because you're going to hear a lot of disinformation come from Market gurus about PE ratios doing strange things so you'll see people making arguments about PE ratios that are disconnected from reality because they're not factoring in those effects any other questions finally I you know to show you that the growth again we're using the insights we got from intrinsic valuation not because we want to do intrinsic valuation but because we want to make sense of pricing you have two companies with the same growth rates I know conventional wisdom is they're the same sector they should trade at the let's say PE ratios but that's not true right it depends on how they arrived at the growth right and the ingredient here that drives it is what kind of return in equity they make on their investment so link of course is remember growth in a sustainable growth equation is return equity times payout retention ratio so if you have a higher return Equity you're delivering the same growth much more efficient and here again no surprise the more efficiently you deliver growth the higher the PE ratio for your companies so we're building the foundation for comparing across companies so remember that mismatch we talked about low P high growth low risk we now have the foundations for why we draw those connections because you can see that with a hypothetical so that's a nice thing about starting with these intrinsic value equations is not because we ever plan to use them to actually do an intrinsic pricing of a company that'd be pointless because just replicate what we did in a DCF it's to get an understanding of what are the things we need to control for when we look at the p e ratio for a company or the EB to sales for a company so I'm going to ask you to you it is what we've learned from just this very simplistic examination of P ratios and I'm going to play the role of a very naive analyst telling you to buy stuff and I want you to play Devil's Advocate and tell me what I'm missing so here's my first try I look across the globe at the parts of the world that have the lowest p ratio so now come up with a list this is actually from the start of this year when I did my updates and I said these are the cheapest markets in the world put all your money in them how many of you want to take your portfolio to where it is and spread it out across those markets but here again you're looking for a mismatcher as you're looking at that list what should you be looking for a country that doesn't belong right maybe the British Virgin Island but I don't even know what those companies are to be quite honest and I would be trading the British Virgin Islands yeah but basically you're saying most of these countries are there for a reason in terms of our fundamentals what is the most easiest explanation why are these countries looking cheap it's a bit much riskier countries so what we said about individual companies applies to countries most countries that look cheap are cheap for a good reason you might all still buy stocks in these companies but you've got to make sure that the risk doesn't explain it away now obviously I haven't given you enough ammunition to be able to do this so I'm going to take a second example it's from way back in time I pulled up a list of Emerging Markets of the P ratios I also put up three fundamentals for each of these markets I put up the level of interest rates in each of these markets the GDP real growth in each of these markets and Country risk in each of these markets again if you want to eyeball the data what's the combination you want you want a low PE on interest rates you want low interest rates or high interest rates you want low interest rates on real growth you want low growth or high growth you want high growth and you want a low country risk measure promise you try to eyeball the data you're going to get dizzy right it's too many numbers you can't bounce so remember we talked about statistics being a tool that can help you so I pulled up opened up my statistics textbook to my multiple regression chapter somebody tell me what a multiple regression what are you doing in a multiple regression you have a dependent variable that you're trying to explain and your independent variables that might explain it right so what's my dependent variable what's the variable that I'm trying to explain I'm trying to explain p e ratios what are the independent variables well the three variables are listed there so Random regression and here's what the regression output looked like there was an intercept what does it tell me well that basically is you know what the overall level of PE ratios are across so you know not much I can read from that it says minus 7.94 times interest rates every one percent increase in interest rate should lower my PE by 7.94 and every it's actually 0.01 so basically 0.0 so no I I just moved it so that it's it's stated as decimals and every one percent increase in GDP increases my PE and every increase so at least the signs are in the right direction that's what's celebrating because that's not always the case we'll talk about why when you run these multiple regression sometimes the science might cut against what you expected to see now it doesn't make them useless but there's factors here that we're not controlling for that can cause it we'll come back and re-examine them the r squared of this regression is 73 is that a good good r squared statistics classes ruin you for life because everything in statistics classes if you notice have R squares of 95 to which my response is why the heck are you wasting your time even testing something like this because you're not scored of 95 you're testing obvious things like how much priority you drink and what's your GPA Beyond a certain point your GPS probably going to go through the toilet so why bother but some are statistic professors think if they show you a low r squared it cuts again statistics so they've got to show you high R squares 73 is about as good as it's going to get in markets I know so as you read those variables you're getting a sense at least that this is how much so now not only have we Quantified the variables that affect P ratios we can tell what would happen to PE ratios my growth goes up or my interest rate score so here's what I did I went back to the previous page and I got a predicted PE for each of these countries you see what I would have predicted for you would be right you plug in that country's interest rate that country's inflation and that country's real growth I get a predicted e ratio so let's take Argentina actual PE was 14 it looked cheap right but once I control for the high risk and the high interest rates my predicted PE is 13.57 it's actually slightly over bad so the predicted p is in a sense a controlled prediction given the growth the risk in the interest rates in that region so if I'm looking for undervalued I'm looking for countries where their actual PE is less than the predicted by a significant amount and saying so how does the r squared of 73 play out yeah when you use a regression you get predictions especially if it's a statistics package It'll ask you whether you want confidence intervals around the estimate if you have a hundred percent R square there is no confidence interval your prediction is perfect when your r squared is 73 there's a range the range will be pretty tight if your r squared is 40 the range will be bigger what I'm trying to preempt is when you do this and you get an r squared some of you are going to say is this good enough but it's not a question good enough you're just getting a range right so basically if you have a lower R square it doesn't mean you can't use the regression you get a wider range it'll mean that more companies fall within the range don't fight the data it is what it is you can't make 30 r squared into a 95 by just pushing things into the regression so this is about knowing what the low R square does it basically gives you a wider range which makes it more difficult to find underpriced overpriced because you've got to be outside the range but that's okay it's what the data tells you and that's what you should be doing so if you wanted to take the lesson on my on my website I could send you the list of P ratios for every country I have it uh you can come suffer to get country risk measures without paying for it but I have the PRS course remember we used that to get of the PRS course for at least 150 countries so maybe you can use the PRS course you'd have to get real growth in inflation and interest rates but you can get them off the IMF website you can do this across the globe and how to use it is there a global portfolio manager and you think about where should my money go on a pricing basis it shouldn't go to the lowest PE markets because that will end up being that list you saw no earlier the riskiest markets in the world it should be those markets where the actual PE is much lower than what you predicted to be given the risk and the growth and the interest rates in that country so that's I got fired at the Emerging Market analyst after I sent you that that by recommendation on the 12 riskiest countries in the world so I've landed on my feet I'm now a market strategist what do they do they tell you when when stocks overall are underpriced and I'm a U.S market strategist so this is actually the p e ratios from 1969 through 2022 and I have you know four different versions the first is a standard P which is price divided by earnings per share the second is a normal ISP where our average earnings across time so you can get a number that's more meaningful the third and the fourth are actually variance of the same thing Robert Schiller won a Nobel Prize for his book on irrational exuberance in one of his arguments is stocks do get overpriced on the price and he's created his own version of P it's actually the price divided by not just average earnings but average earnings adjusted for inflation so his argument is inflation you know earnings from 12 years ago you can't average with earnings today so it's not a big difference first thing is notice that all four measures of p e ratio pretty much move the same way this is why when somebody says I want to use a more sophisticated measure P I say go for it I'm okay with it because you're going to come to the same conclusions as I am but at the end of 2020 at the start of 2023 you can already see that if you look at the companies it should be started 2023 I'm sorry the p e ratio was 17.49 for the market the normalized numbers are all down from where they were over the last decade that could play the role of a short-term markets right it says stocks are cheap because of p e ratio now is lower than it was a couple of years ago but what would I be missing if I did that because they are lower interest rates are higher right and we talked about how interest rates need to be compared so at the height of the market about two years ago when interest rates were really low I drew a graph where I decided to compare to the p e ratio for stocks the p e ratio for T bonds you see what p ratio per T Bond you pay a price for a bond what formed your earnings take coupons right see we have a two percent D bond rate your p e ratio where T bond is 50. so I decided to put the graphs because I wanted to see how much of the variation in stock p e ratios is explained by what's happening to interest rate very simplistic correction so if you look at the two numbers you can see that the Blue Line the t-bond piece you know when interest rates go to one one and a half percent it's going to shoot through the roof it's a very simplistic way to push back at people or just look at the PE Ratio and don't think about interest rates say look you're really comparing two PE ratios one is the p e ratio for stocks the other is the p e ratio for T bonds and stocks don't become cheaper expensive on their own until you compare them to what you're making on bonds and debuts there's a very good explanation for why PE ratios over the last decade was so much higher than they've been historically it's because interest rates were far lower in the last decade than any other decade in history those days might be done but at least when you look back at time you can explain why so many people fell into the Trap and saying there's a bubble I remember people in 2012 some big names saying don't be in stock stocks are overpriced they found them overpriced all the way through the decade because it's looking at PE ratios and comparing them to Historic averages so here's a very simple way to kind of illustrate the link between P ratios and T baud rates if you invert the PPE ratio earnings over Price It's called an earnings yield so think of that as a e over P rather than b if you take a graph of earnings to price ratio so earnings so it's actually the the purple line here I'm sorry no the red line here and the t-bond rate you can already see the two tend to move together right I don't as t-bond rates go up earnings the price ratio score saying what's this third line the purple line that's a difference between the t-bond rate and the T build rate you know what that's capturing when that number is zero you've got a flat ear cup and that number is negative you've got a downward sloping yield curve when that number is positive you've got an upward slope but you see who cares historically what is the slope of the yield curve acted as a predictor of what do people worry about when you or economic growth which is flatter and outward sloping yield curves have been associated with lower expected earnings with lower expected economic growth so it becomes a proxy for growth so I be earning surprise ratio I have the t-bond rate and this proxy for growth I ran a regression at the audience Professor I ran a correlation see if how they were linked no surprises here the earnings yield and the t-bond rate are very heavily positively correlated in other words as t-bond rates go up earnings price ratios cops in your mind remember the earnings price ratios go up inverted your PE ratios go down at really high interest rates you should trade at low PE ratios as t-bond rates come down on its price ratios come down which kind of makes sense the second gives you the link between earn Express ratios and the slope of the yield curve the flatter or more negative sloping the yield curve the lower PE ratios become why because they become proxies for growth so before your end regressions actually you know running the correlation will give you a sense of hey should I even bother running a regression here here I'm going to bother I'm going to write the regression here's what the output look like so this is from 1963 to 22 data the earnings for Price ratio regressed against the t-bond rate and the difference between the T bond rate and the t-bit rate let's read the Goldfish and every one percent increase in t Bond rates increases my earnings price ratio by 0.55 percent so if you sit there and say you know what t-bond rate is now three and a half percent they're going to go to eight percent let's say you're incredibly pessimistic about inflation you think you say what will happen to the earning surprise ratio I can work out mechanically this is how much your earning surprise ratio should go up and every one percent increase in the slope of the yield cup the more upward sloping it is the lower my ionic surprise ratio will be coming remember again in your mind lower earnings price ratios translate to higher p e ratios you see what are these numbers and brackets below you know what they say whenever you run a regression before you read too much into the regression you want to make sure it's statistically significant those numbers and brackets are T statistics does anybody remember the rule on T statistics or to be significant what do they have to be they have to be higher but what's the thresholds we used before because two is really good right 95 1.3 you might be able to live with but if you see 0.7.8 you're saying this is not really worth even leaving in the regression notice the slope of the the slope of the yield curve now has a t statistic less than one to show you how much things have changed this was my regression through 2008 I've been running this regression every year compared to two regressions and you can see already the effect on the yield curve has become much smaller over the last 15 years than it used to be how many times whenever the yield curve becomes flat or negative for the last four years every time that happens you read at least three or four Wall Street Journal articles about a recession coming in the next six months now this is almost like people seem to think this is some kind of a perfect signal it might have been through 2008 it no longer is at least the data suggests that it's become a much weaker predictor of economic growth and we could talk about why that is maybe it's got to do with the fed and how it's behaving and how people read the Fed but the next time you read this article about downward slope yield curve guaranteed recession maybe the data needs to be brought out to say that's no longer true that link seems to have broken and at least become weaker over the last 15 years now if I asked you to use this regression to tell me what the stocks are underpriced or overpriced today what would you do so I have the regression so through 2022 what's the t-bond rate right now 3.3 something like that so you plug in a 3.3 percent and the table right now I think is like four and a half percent so that's minus one point so if you plug in those numbers into this regression you're going to get a predicted earning surprise ratio let's say a predicted earnings price ratio is six percent I don't know what it is you could plug in the numbers what do I do next I inverted right a six percent earning surprise becomes a PE ratio of roughly 16.2 I compared to the actual P which was like 17. and I decide stocks are overpriced but not by insanely large amounts it's a mildly over price it's 17 times x plug it in if you get a chance it'll take you two minutes to do you can do a drive while you're here and put a new calculator what's your 3.3 percent minus 1.2 percent see what you get as a predicted PE yeah it's a very so you can be Market strategist on a low budget here right and guess what you're going to do at least as well as those Market strategies on a high budget because all the traditional ammunition they bring to the table doesn't seem to add much to predictive value any questions on earnings price ratio so you can already see that even doing a very simplistic intrinsic value calculation of a peer ratio it's not the equation that you use but how you can use that equation to answer big questions about hey Stock's overpriced on the prices you know what do I control for when I compare across companies or even across countries so staying on the same theme of digging deeper and seeing what drives multiples I'm going to go to a ratio called the PEG ratio you know PEG ratio is the p ratio divided by expected growth rate so I'll give you an example we have a stock of the PE Ratio 25 and an expected growth rate of 10 no so the expected growth rate is over the next five years maybe next three years so it's kind of you know it's not clearly defined but let's say it's 10 25 divided by 10 percent uh 25 times earnings divided by 10 gives me a PEG ratio of 2.5 so make sure you convert the percent into an absolute number divide your p e ratio by that number you get a PEG ratio so why would people come up with something like that why do you think people came up with pay gracious I'll tell you where the roots of this are this The Roots were in the 1970s when Peter Lynch was given this task or running the Fidelity Magellan fight the Fidelity Magellan fund was a fund investing in the growth companies of that day at that time everybody used PE ratios and Peter Lynch very quickly discovered he had a problem you know the promise he was tasked with buying growth companies but if you look at PE ratios none of them ever look cheap so he wanted to bring growth into the comparison saying I want a way of being able to pick cheap companies even if they traded High P ratios if they have high growth it's a very simplistic adjustment but basically he his argument is this allows us to now bring in growth companies into a choice because if a company has a high enough growth rate I'll buy it at 30 times earnings or 40 times earnings sounds good right and many people who continue to use Peg ratios use the same rationale yeah it doesn't um it comes from somewhere it you know the PEG ratio is agnostic about where you get the growth rate from it could come from Equity analysts you could use historical growth if you don't trust them you can use sustainable growth remember so the the PEG ratio itself doesn't specify where you get the growth you're right if you go to Capital IQ and you download the growth rate from analysts you are using Equity analyst growth but that's you know or and all of these but remember when you talk about pricing you're assuming the Market's on average right which also means by extension that the forecast of growth that are driving the market so the minute you walk into the pricing choice you already made that Faustian bargain to trust the data in this case even though their biases as long as the bias is cut in the same direction for every company you can live with it because it's a relative state yeah so that's part of what's driving the PEG ratio but I think the question of is growth neutralized because that's basically the argument that people use with pay gracious is now I can compare high growth companies with low growth companies there's an easy way to test to see if Peg ratios get rid of growth remember the two-stage dividend discount model that I used to get a PE ratio I started with the same two-stage dividend discount model and I divided both sides first by the earnings and then by the growth rate and I ended up with an equation for the PEG ratio now what's a pitch if you spec ratios you don't have to worry about growth take a look at the equation is growth gone it's all pretty well right it's all over the beach in the new bridge it's a complete and total mess I I don't like Peg ratios the reason I don't like pack ratios they're incredibly difficult to Think Through into it with P ratios if I said as growth increases what happened to be at least in a sense of direction you can say p e goes up if I ask you the same question about Peg ratios it's actually very difficult to answer the question because it's everywhere so to kind of illustrate this I'm going to go back to the hypothetical example I showed you remember that company with uh with with with the with the 15 growth for the next five years I'm going to take that company and show you what happens as I change one variable at a time as I change growth as I change and I'll tell you what we're going to see first is when you look at Peg ratios across stocks higher risk companies will always end up with lower Peg ratios with lower risk companies right you can see that already because for any given growth rate I said you'd pay a lower p so if I just pick low pack ratio stocks I'm going to end up with the riskiest stocks in the market or the markets or the stocks the lowest returns in equity I can live with that if that was the early problem with PEG ratios and growth the relationship becomes messy because higher growth can lower your peg ratios but they can also raise your peg ratios depending on which segment of the growth the you know I'm going to show you a graph of Peg versus growth and you're going to see a U-shaped graph where initially as growth goes up the PEG ratio goes down but then it starts going back up again which makes it very difficult to control for when you're comparing across companies so I went back to that that same company that I used for my PE ratio and this time I computed a PEG ratio so think of this as the intrinsic PEG ratio with these inputs the PEG ratio for the company should be 1.94 incidentally when interest rates go down Peg ratios go up across the board the reason I emphasize that is that actually these rules of thumbnail Peg ratios that I think analysts still latch on to it's a PEG ratio less than one is cheap don't ask me where it came from but that time seems to have become this rule of thumb and those analysts at a really tough time over the last decade because fewer and fewer stocks actually had Peg ratios less than one because interest rates push them up so that's my intrinsic PEG ratio so here's the first thing I did I kept everything else constant and changed my Beta from 0.5 to 2.5 across the board what happens Peg ratios they collapse you know I list last week I was looking at a tech an anal an equity research report from a tech address and the way he was picking stocks was looking at the PEG ratio for his company these are small tech companies and comparing to the PEG ratio for the s p 500. and you say this company is cheap it's trading at 0.7 PEG ratio of 0.7 the PEG ratio for the S P 500 is 1.5 already you can see the floor right it's a riskier stock you should expect to trade less at lower PEG ratio higher risk holding all its constant will push down your PEG ratio but here's the part that that that that you know and with return Equity again you get the sense of direction at least as I increase my return Equity my peg ratios increase why because I'm more efficiently delivering the same growth so with risk and growth at least I know which direction the PEG ratio moves as risk goes up Peg ratios go down as return equities go up pig ratios go on so if I asked you at this point to find me a cheap stock at a PEG ratio basis you want a low PEG ratio you're at low risk or high risk you want low risk because high risk could explain away and you want a high return equity but then if I asked you you want a high growth rate or a low grade growth rate here's the problem you're going to run into as I increase my growth rate from three percent to 15 to 30. initially what happens back ratios they decrease but there's some growth rate at which they start a reverse Direction and start to go back up again and this makes life really difficult because then I ask you do you want a low PEG ratio or a high PEG ratio you're going to say I want something in the middle right because and this is the problem what is in the middle even mean I have a really tough time pricing company pack ratio because I do the risk part I can do the return Equity part but then I said what do I do about this growth rate because I don't even know which direction pack ratios should go as growth decreases I don't think we should be using pack ratios to be quite honest I would remove them from the Lexicon because they don't do what they're supposed to do which is neutralize growth they create this incredibly messy relationship with growth so next time you see an equity research report with PEG ratio a lot of tech analysts to use Peg ratios take a closer look at whether that question is being asked and answered about what do I do about growth and what it does to preparations so let me summarize what we've learned about Peg ratios even with that very simplistic comparison one is high-risk companies will look cheap on a PEG ratio basis if you don't control for risk technology companies always look cheaper than utilities on a pack ratio basis so you need to control for risk High return and Equity companies will always have much higher Peg ratios than low return Equity companies doesn't make them expensive it just reflects the fact that return Equity trip and with growth you gotta look at what the PEG ratio relationship is with growth within your sector so if you have a range of companies from low growth to high growth in your sector let the data tell you because I can't tell you in theory what should happen because as you saw the relationship kind of breaks down somewhere in the middle so the problem with PEG ratio is in a mispricing basis you can get two-thirds of the way there on growth and risk on I'm sorry risk risk and return Equity but you can't nail the argument checked with that this is the growth rate I'd expect to see so that's Peg ratios talk about Book value but intuitively you know what what we're doing Book value multiples right we're taking the market price and we're relating it to what did the accountant tell us about this company I've always felt that when you use book values your trusting accountants to be right fundamentally but there are people who do that and among value investors Price to Book ratios are among the most widely used multiples that stock trades at less than Book value it must be cheap and they make a link between Book value and liquidation value that I've never quite got but that is the underlying assumption so a lot of equity research is still built upon especially if it's old-time value research is built upon Price to Book ratios and looking for stocks with low price to progressions so again let's think about the questions you would need to ask when Trump somebody tries to sell you a stock because it trades at less than Book value half a book value third a book value so the way I'm going to do this is to do what I did with p ratio it's an equity multiple I'm going to go back to a stable growth dividend discount model and from this point on I'm never going to go back to two-stage model why mess with the algebra because we know the variables are going to be the same you divide both sides of the equation by the book value here's what you get Price to Book ratio for a stable growth dividend paying company is a function of its return Equity its payout ratio its cost of equity and its growth rate remember what the variables with p ratio growth payout and cost of equity I've added a fourth variable when I brought in Price to Book that fourth variable is return Equity every multiple has what I call a companion variable what does that mean it's a one question I need to get asked and answered before I ask any other question with Price to Book when he says talk it's cheap because it's trading at half a book value my first question to you is going to be what's its return equity and ninety percent of the time guess what you're going to get it's either negative or a really low number and I'm going to say that explains the low price super ratio most companies most sectors that traded low price to book ratios have low returns in equity most sectors are traded high priced book ratios have high expected returns and Equity they might not have it now but in fact I can go one step further because if you think about what the growth rate is the sustainable growth equation and I wrote it out as one minus the payout ratio times return equity and plugged it back something magical happens my Price to Book ratio equation it simplifies to return Equity minus the growth rate in the numerator and cost of equity minus growth rate in the denominator if that equation applies you know what's what kinds of companies trade it close to book value right if you're a company that has a return Equity close to your cost of equity you traded roughly Price to Book ratio it could roughly book bag if your return Equity is expected to be higher than the cost of equity she traded well above bookmark remember we talked about competitive advantages in various battery if you're in a business with significant competitive advantage of Battery Center you're making a case for return Equity being higher than the cost of equity you should trade at a much higher multiple of Book value if you're on a comparative sector where your return Equity is going to roughly be equal to your cost of equity you should trade roughly Book value if you're in a sector where you're having a tough time making your cost of equity you should trade it well below Book value doesn't make you cheap you're just a bad bad business so it's a very simplistic way of thinking about what is it that drives Price to Book ratio but a very effective way of explaining why Price to Book ratios change over time or vary across sectors so that's a Price to Book ratio right is there an Enterprise Value analog to Price to Book my numerator will then be market value Equity plus debt minus cash Enterprise Value by denominator then has to be Book value equity plus book value debt minus cash which is invested capital if I made this Enterprise Value to invested capital I know it's unfair because you haven't seen the algebra what do you think my right hand side of the equation is going to look like when I did Price to Book it's return Equity minus growth divided by cost of equity minus growth if I'm doing Enterprise Value to invest Capital which is the Enterprise Value analog it's a return Equity what should I be looking at return on Capital so cost of equity I'm going to have costly Capital guess what the equation looks exactly the same the only difference is when I do Enterprise Value multiples I'm looking at excess returns relative to the cost of capital but the same logic applies if you have a business that's earning roughly its cost to Capital its Enterprise Value should be roughly equal to its invested Capital if you're well above your cost of capital it should be above you're well below your cost of capital it should be below it's an Insight we use when we talked about growth right we said growth creates value only if you earn more than the cost of capital it's just playing out as a market value relative to your book value in your company p ratio PEG ratio now by the time you get the fourth multiple you can see I'm doing the same thing right I go back to an intrinsic value equation I do the algebra and I want it to become almost second nature to you so when I say I pay a high value per user I want you to be able to take the algebra and figure out what the value of a user is and what are the variables that determine whether you pay a hundred dollars per user or thirty dollars per user but the Enterprise Value to ebitda you're taking market value Equity plus debt minus cash we talked about why and dividing by a bit down okay and I think I pointed out when I introduced it that over the last four decades it's been an explosion in the use of EB debit I remember the early 80s looking at equity research reports maybe one in a hundred UCB turbita today maybe 35 of all equity research is built around EB tapita what are the good reasons given for why people prefer you beta there are some good reasons what's one advantage of going from PE ratios to EB debit more less variation over time so that's one what else first remember when you're earnings are negative you can't do p e ratios right they're far more companies with negative net income than negative Epitaph so you lose fewer companies that's a good thing third is to the extent that you have differences in how you depreciate remember depreciation is an accounting choice and different companies can use it so the good reasons why there's been a shift DVD appetite at least in some sectors you can say that makes a lot of sense you know the bad reason is it's psychological and I'll give you an example if I ask you to pay 50 times earnings for a company most people even people who have only a limited experience with the market you know have a sense of hey what typical year you've you've heard about in CNBC 18 times earnings so when I give you eight times habitat remember you don't have a frame of reference it looks cheaper you know what as human beings we go to a frame of reference or whatever we're comfortable with and we're more conversant and comfortable with PE ratios we we know we shouldn't be doing this but we're comparing eight times our beta to the 18 times price earnings ratio that we're saying hey that looks cheap it's completely wrong but when you don't have a frame of reference that's exactly what's going to happen I would often ask people to use EB debit and you can try this ask them what the median EB debit does for the entire Market you think they'd know right many of them absolutely not I'll tell you what it is in my second I said I don't care tell me because if you don't how the heck can you walk around telling me eight times advertise cheaper 12 times up it does see people don't have a frame of reference in ebitdabitat that's why lbos and the original private Equity deals were structured on EBT because you could sell some real dogs using EBT five times Epitaph that looks really cheap to me so let's dig on eBay and let's see what drives EB term so by now you know the trick right EB to advertise of firm value multiple I went back to the simplest form value multiple equation I could think of Enterprise Value is free cash for the firm next year divided by Costa Capital minus the growth rate for quite a little messy algebra but when I was done with the algebra here's what I ended up with so you can actually write free cash for the firm in terms of ebitda I usually don't because it's a pain in the neck but the free cash flow of the firm can actually be written as a bit dot times one minus the tax rate plus the tax rate times if you don't believe me work out the algebra it's it's the precache for the firm equation but if I divide both sides by Epitaph I end up with the determinants of EV debit and let me list them up the first variable that drives EV to have it as your tax rate the higher your tax rate the lower your EB to epidemic explain to me why why did I not when I did PE ratios how come I never thought about tax rates what goes to the denominator P earnings per share which is already after taxes we have really high taxes your income should reflect it right here I'm starting with a pre-tax number and if you're starting with a pre-tax number I have to ask you the question I mean let's say your tax rate is 100 you know what I should pay for your company absolutely nothing because they're going to take away all my earnings the higher my tax rate the lower my EB debit I want you to start thinking about the perfect cheap company in an EV tablet databases already so tax rate Maps let's keep going it's a change in working capital if you think of them in a Consolidated basis can you think of something where all three come into play capex depreciation and change in working capital that's a total reinvestment holding all its constant the higher the reinvestment for a company for any given growth rate the lower the EBT why because if I'm reinvesting more to get the same growth rate I have less cash flows left over so tax rate matter reinvestment matters you go to the denominator holding all its constant the higher my cost to Capital the lower maybe debit test so we have two companies one in a safe country and the other in a risky country the same business I would expect my Argentine Steel company to trade at a lower Evita than my children Steel company simply because it's a higher risk and finally growth matters higher growth companies should have higher EB debit tax rates reinvestment basic cost of capital and growth rate so give me a perfect cheap company and an EB debit databases you want low EB debit up you're in low cost capital or high cost of capital your low cost of Capital High Cost of capital to explain it away low growth or high growth when high growth low reinvestment or higher investment you got a 50 50 shot but now it's low reinvestment or another way of saying it is a high return on Capital same thing same thing low tax rate or high tax rate you want to load tax rate otherwise so you don't want anything in that mix to explain away the low EB debit again think of it you're saying what chance you have for finding something like this no harm looking nice thing about screening big databases you can say I want every stock that trades at less than 10 times ebitda has a tax rate less than 20 percent as a growth rate greater than 10 don't get too cared weights I want to growth rate greater than 50 you could try but you get nothing coming through don't get greedy but you want to get that mix going for your company if you're truly looking for a cheap company yes only very mildly so at the extent that your tax rate is higher it's true your after tax cost of debt will be lower but the tax effect almost always because the benefit you get is a one minus t effect whereas what do you get taken out of your cash flows if it's all your cash flow so it's only a portion of your Capital so even if the cost of capital is lower because of your tax rate being higher you don't be lower enough to make up for your lost cash flows so again let's use yeah go ahead pricing there is no should be right so here's the answer to the question if you use adjusted ebitda use it for all your companies and hope and pray that the adjustment is not skewing you to what's going but it will right what's the adjustment that makes the biggest change to your adjusted Epitaph what gets added back to it to the stated appetite to make the adjusted evidence what's the item it's usually stock based compensation it's the biggest item so you know what that's going to bias your towards right companies the largest stock based compensation are going to look cheap to you on an adjusted Epitaph basis and that might lead you to very dangerous place you're buying these companies because they look cheap but they have options waiting to blow up on you so I think you have to be careful I mean you can use it just wrap it up but if you have very different the thing you might want to control first how much stock based compensation these companies have as a person of Revenue and that too you can do on Capital IQ you can look for stock based compensation as another item that you want to control for so there's no wrong pricing as long as you ask the right questions so you want to use a multiple of adjusted and we use multiples of revenues so I adjusted advertise this one more intermediate stop right so you can use any intermediate stop as long as you remember to ask questions about everything that comes below that intermediate stock yes so sorry absolutely but then you have to ask then you have to make more assumptions too right because you'd use free cash for the firm you bring in capex depreciation working capital from the most recent year right so and then if that Year is off so no matter what you do there are questions you need to ask so they're the questions you might ask is was my reinvestment last year normal year what did I read best a lot so otherwise you're going to bias yourself against companies that reinvest a lot last year the infrastructure companies the growth might be in a sense free growth so there's really no way around asking some follow-up questions but which ones you ask will depend on what your denominator is okay but you're right that last question to ask if your denominators already netted that's why you have fewer questions with the earnings per share than you do with Epitaph right and fewer questions there but that than you do with revenues because as you move down the income statement you're hoping that the cleaning up has already happened and you can just use that metric can I take a simple as again I'm going to use like I did with P ratios and Peg ratios take you know hypothetical company you have a company that has a 36 tax rate capex is 30 of appetite depreciation is 20 so net capex is 10 of Epitaph cost of capital is ten percent but Simplicity let's assume no working cap but I could have thrown that in there as well if I wanted to and ask you what's a fair EB turbotel for this company so you plug in the numbers 36 tax rate 20 depreciation 30 capex and I come up with 8.24 let me again emphasize what that tells me if I ever value in this company with a discounted cash flow model I'd be coming up with 8.24 times Epitaph it's a very bad intrinsic EV tablet so you're not doing this to get that number you're doing this too because you want to ask order questions what if my tax rate were different so if I change my tax rate for this company holding all else constant if I change my tax rate from zero percent to fifty percent my EV Tabata goes from 14 times up down to less than six times seven higher tax rate companies have lower EB to Avatar multiplication you know how this is going to play out let's suppose you become a telecom analyst in Europe the companies in your sector are basically telecom companies spread out across 15 different countries Telecom in there if you're not careful and you pick companies based on low EB to ebitda multiples you might end up with telecom companies in the highest tax rate countries looking cheap and you buy them they have nothing to do with cheapness it's different tax rates playing huh so different tax rates affect EV tablet don't second the second graph I kept growth fixed and changed my net capex as a percentage of Epitaph so if I the less I invest in net capex for a given growth rate the higher my EB debit down which is another way of saying if I have a higher return on Capital my new Investments I should be willing to pay a much higher multiple of Epitaph for a company that if I earn a low return on Capital so the last graph I've actually show what happens to EB debit as a function of return on Capital High return Capital company should trade it much higher multiples of epitaph so again ammunition you can use to think about that cheap company low EBT I want a low tax rate I want a low cost capital I want a high return on Capital you're not being greedy you just want to make sure you find this mismatch and say that's my company which is mispressed so one way to think about this if I came to you with a multiple you haven't seen yet and say what are the questions you'd ask about this month you know the first thing you're going to do right you're going to look at it and say it's an equity multiple or an Enterprise Value multiple and then you're going to follow up by saying if it's an Enterprise Value multiple I'm going to go back to an Enterprise Value discounted cash flow models not because I want the user to come up with the model because it'll tell me what variables I should be controlling for with this Market so let me do a final multiple which is revenue multiple because I want to bore you with the algebra because by now you get it Equity multiples go back to Dividend discount model Enterprise Value Marketplace go back to stable growth free cash for the firmware let's talk about Revenue models why do people write yeah go ahead yeah but you know in a sense nobody's willing to own the equity where would the debt even survive in a universe like that okay without Equity remember debt is kind of a leech Capital without Equity there is no debt right so I think that unfortunately the argument mathematically or absolutely right there's interest payments and principal payments with the value of the debt because nobody's holding the equity there is no firm right and tax rates never hit a hundred percent they converge towards a hundred percent the highest corporate tax rate now is 32 34 I think so where no but that's it so that's why push it towards 100 but at 100 just to show an extreme example your Equity value goes to zero let's talk about Revenue markets as I said there are two versions of Revenue multiplication practice unfortunately the version that I see more frequently is price to sales why is it unfortunate because it's not internally consistent right market cap which is just the equity divided by total revenue for everybody which is really uh argument for we should all be moving if you're going to use the revenue multiple going towards EB to sales no I remember a couple of years ago I was at CNBC and somebody said Apple's PE ratio is 12 and I said it's not you know why right you're taking market cap of Apple and divide by this was an apple it hit a low in 2017. and it was getting almost one quarter of its value from its cash balance if I wanted a p e ratio I really want to take the interest income from cash out of the numerator which is close to zero then and take the cash out of the numerator apple is actually trading at about seven to eight times earnings see even for companies with no debt there's an argument that using an Enterprise Value to you know or to earnings or in this case netting out the cash would give you a much more meaningful estimate of what you're paying for this company so people like Revenue multiples because you lose far fewer firms in fact almost lose no firms right there almost no firms there with zero Revenue there are a few I think last year when I looked at the 7500 us companies there were probably a hundred which had no revenues you know the other group that has no revenues Financial Service firms often have no sustained remedies because there's no equivalent to rabbits but you lose far fewer folks so you think about what drives Evita sales I'll cut to the chase I won't do the algebra if you do the algebra it turns out that the companion variable for any Revenue multiple is a profit margin if it's EB to sales it's operating margin if it's priced to sales if you insist on using price to sales what margin should I be looking at net profit margin basically it'll be a net income divided by sales so at least be internally consistent everything else looks exactly the same as it did for every other EB multiple so if you told me a company is cheap because it's trading at 0.3 times revenues I'm going to ask you what's the margin at this company most of the time the answer is it's a discount retailer with three no three percent margins a two and a half percent margins or four percent margins it's inside I'm going to try to use to estimate the value of a brand new remember I showed you the price of uh of bare aspirin versus a generic aspect so you get pricing power you charge a higher price the variable where it's going to show up the most is in your profit margin brand name companies a strong brand name companies will tend to have much higher margins than weak brand name companies or generic Market companies so if I could compute the EB to sales ratio for your company with your current module which is high because you have a strong branding and then I was able to compute the EV to sales for your company with that pricing power removed I should be able to Value the brand so I'm going to close with an example this is from 15 20 years ago the numbers are dated you know somebody who went through this class went to work at Coca-Cola probably because they like to drink all the coke they could all day you know and they called me and they said look you know can you come in and talk to our management team about the valuable brand name because we're obsessed about brand name here so I flew to Atlanta and showed up the top Headhunters Coca-Cola were in the room and I did an intrinsic valuation of Coca-Cola and remember Coca-Cola is a it's unlike other beverage companies because the bottling was spun up it's just the syrup it's pure bread so how does it show up it shows up as this huge operating margin which translates into a high return on Capital so I plugged it through I've finished the value and I say you know companies worth about 80 billion and one of the people in the room the head marketing launcher puts up his hand and said you forgot something very important he said what did I forget please no maybe I forgot a beverage or a geography he said you've forgotten the fact that Coca-Cola is one of the most valuable brand names in the world I said okay so what do you want me to do he said you said at least a 20 premium to the 80 billion I said why he said because that's what we do at Coca-Cola is when we buy brand name companies in other countries we value them and then we add 20 and I said just because you do stupid things doesn't mean I have to do stupid things too he said don't you think our brand name is worth at least 30 percent it's the only valuable thing in this building the rest of you can leave and leave me the syrup I could probably get the same 80 billion dollar value so why aren't you building an egg I said because it's already in there he said where everywhere your margin is 15.4 you think that's because of the days you had that mistake 20 remember 30 years ago the thought was about the taste and they tried to change the taste and they realized nobody cared about the taste I mean let's face it Coca-Cola doesn't taste the same across the world I live in San Diego so I can drink the Mexican version of Coca-Cola which actually uses sugar rather than corn syrup very I prefer it very different taste so this has nothing to do with taste it's already in there he said I don't believe you so what happens if you get into an argument with the marketing person but I get prepared I got lucky I found a company called caught COPD it's a Canadian company that makes generic sodas it sells a lot of sort it's the reason you never hear of it is you when you walk into a grocery store you buy the generic Cola take a look at the manufacturer it's usually caught they let every Supermarket put its own name on it and I said let's play a game Let's suppose tomorrow we all woke up with Selective Amnesia and the only thing we didn't recognize was the red can or the word Coca-Cola you lost your pricing power you're going to become a generic sort of manufacturer and guess how it manifests it shows up as a margin that's one-third lower and there's Ripple effects right lower margins but get lower returns and capital lower returns in capital period lower growth rate you trace it all the way down the value that you get with the pricing margin drop to generic levels is 15.4 billion you want me to add a brand name premium I gave you a 64 billion dollar premium you don't think it's enough tell me why maybe I'm under utilizing or you're under utilizing your brand name but if you do things right it should already be in there so as you think about no where does this shop your job is to say this is the very it's a very simplistic comparison the next session when we start we're going to ask why is it so much more difficult estimating the brand name value at an apple as opposed to Coca-Cola and I want you to think about why that's going to be it is more difficult but you can see why brand name value is easier to estimate if you have a cereal or a soda as opposed to a laptop computer or a regular computer with an operating system that is proprietary so when we start on Wednesday we'll talk about bringing in those components but at least you have the mechanism now for thinking about brand name that um what other number would you change cost of capital is a plastic app based on macro factors there are no company specific component the cost of capital shouldn't be any different maybe sales to capitals maybe it'll be higher for brand name companies you can actually let the sales Capital also change but the name the number is going to show up in most business so why like because because it's a higher price right it's got a higher price for the same product what is it sure Bears margin it's going to be much higher than CBS is margin they both make the aspirin that's it price when they're actually the same oh yeah that's the cost of the sale but they're charging 8.69 so it's going to show up as module so you use the same Revenue yeah because I'm trying I'm not comparing Coca-Cola to card I'm comparing Coca-Cola with the brand name into Coca-Cola without the branding okay so why you use the same reinvestment rate because I don't use the same reinvestment rate I have to say I have a lower return on Capital so I have a higher reinvestment rate to get the same growth rate yeah so either my growth has to be lower or my reinvestment has to be so if I have a lower return on Capital which is um because I have lower growth rate so basically I load the return because so either I can have a lower reinvestment rate and let's say so if I keep the growth fixed and the return on Capital lower right so it's going to show up as a lower growth rate the high growth period so if you look at the high growth period growth rate I use 10.42 so the same reinvestment rate delivers a higher growth rate at Coca-Cola than it does the alternative is I could have kept the growth rate at 10.42 but then I'd have to reinvest almost 250 percent to get to that same growth rate so there is still like some constant so there are three variables two of them can change the other one is computed so in this case I'm letting the return on Capital change I'm letting the and so the reinvestment rate and the growth rate is a computed number so if I decide to change the growth rate then and then so you see what I'm saying if I kept the growth rate fixed and the reinvestment rate would be the computer bearing so two of the three can be estimated or assumed the third always has to be computed so is this like the rule for all the brand valuation or kind of I mean I mean you don't have to use an intrinsic value model but it's driven by margin so you value the company with a higher margin you value and you have a complete flexibility you can change the cost of capital you can change the sales to Capital you can so you can actually take your DC evaluation if it's a brand name company then what would be different about this valuation so the target margin instead of using 15 you did six percent but you might say to compensate I'm going to allow them to have less advertising which translates into higher sales of capital ratio yeah so you might give them a lower margin a higher Sales Corporation the value that you get then the difference between the two values will be the brand name right so you have isolated everything into the margin yeah but I could have let the Sales Gap will be different for for uh if you have if you have a generic soda company you know and I can have a different reinvestment rate if I choose to for the generic sort of company and take the entire difference in value and say that's because of brand name that's an interesting one yeah I got it I I always question practice is to some other companies because this is definitely very well the thing is it's easy in a Coca-Cola because they're only competitive advantages brand me yeah the reason it's going to be more difficult for an apple is you think about why Apple earns a higher return it's not just because of brand name it's also because they went off what you're getting is a Consolidated effect of all the competitive advantages and if you're only competitive Advantage it's brand name the entire difference is because of brand name with Coca-Cola with apple when I do this that difference in value is because of brand name it's because of the operating system it's because of styling it's all of their different competitive advantages then if you said how much of this difference is because of branding I don't know that's the reason I think we shouldn't be actually valuing brand name on balance sheets because Coca-Cola Kellogg's you can do it but how the heck we even do that for an apple right you're taking this Consolidated benefit and in a sense almost arbitrarily saying 30 is for brand name 20 is for styling 35 to the operating system yeah because those are not yeah there are multiple competitive advantages they all show up as higher excess returns right that makes and that's why for companies with multiple comparative advantages I can give you the value of all the competitive advantages put together but I can't tell you the value of each one separately and I don't care because I'm buying the company but accountants are trying to break it down into individual components and I think it's a recipe for disaster because they're using different rules for each one they're often ending up double counting things or miscounting things because you're trying to separate things that cannot be separated thank you yes yes no lower return Capital whether whether you really want to you know then grow at a lower rate yeah yeah or reinvest more not be never been lower reinvestment rates it'll actually be higher reinvestment rates to get the same growth rate or keep the reinvestment rate the same and end up with the lower growth rate I chose the lower growth option but the other option you could have tried is I want to grow as fast as Coca-Cola 10.42 but your reinvestment rate would then have to be 220 percent um so my question is like the margin like marginal umbrella you know sometimes people are trying to make up for lower markets higher volume the choice that I you saw a higher sets of capital so if you're picking between uh high margin low sales strategy in a low margin High sale strategy two things will change one is the margin obviously the second is the sales to Capital ratio will be lower in the first strategy and higher in the second one if you multiply the two you know what you get you get the return in capital so you know whichever strategy ends up giving you the higher return Capital you go with that one because that's going to be the net effect that drives that but you can actually think about those two as the levers that drive that decision of do I what kind of marketing strategy you want to adopt no high price low volume low price high volume and you can play it out in sales to cap that's the volume and the margin is the pricing so foreign 
is [Music] your own work so I'm going to get started now so let's um let's let's talk more about pricing okay I'm going to start by presenting you with the challenge and each of you might end up facing once you've finished the pricing of a company so most of you have finished your evaluation how do I know because you got the feedback presumably you built it in you got a value for your ship the next and last part of the project for most of you is to price your camera find a sector find a multiple price your company so let's say I've done both in my company and you're going to see in the context of this this question why I am so fixated on using the word price when you use a multiple so I'm going to stay with a conventional practices calling everything valuation you've done a discounted cash flow evaluation you come up with ten dollars per share the stock is trading at 15. so if I stopped right there then no brain is saying why do I buy that company but then you do a pricing for your company against the software sector which is where it is and you come up with a pricing of 20. so you see the challenge you face what's the final thing you have to do on your project tell me whether you're going to buy or sell right and the two signals are pulling in opposite directions the discounted cash flow evaluation says sell you can't tell me to buy and sell please don't do that right so you got to decide which so I'm going to read a few statements about the what looks like contradictory signals and you tell me which one you would buy into the stock is undervalued because its price is the price is less than relative value it's overvalued because the price is greater than intrinsic value the stock is correctly valued because you took the average of the two numbers what do you think about that idea you had the 20 plus or 10 divided by two you get 15 right this is like saying I'll be a Muslim for the first half of the day and a Christian for the second half it doesn't end well because somewhere along the way you have to make choices never ever mix a pricing with evaluation you know how many IPOs I see where people do this the banker would say we've used four different approaches to evaluation there'll be a DCF and then a pricing with PE pricing with EB debit pricing with this you'll average the four numbers up and act like this somehow carries a signal stronger than any of the four numbers so you want to take the three pricings and average amount I can live with that but never bring an intrinsic value into it so Choice C is not a good choice even though Bankers use it could the four Choice be could the could a stock be both undervalued and overvalued same time and this is where the using of the word pricing can help you this stock is an overvalued stock and an underpriced stock do you think how can they coexist what do we do in pricing we take what the market is paying and we extrapolate to what we would pay for a stock let's say markets are over over paying too much for software companies sometimes when you have a sector and a bubble that's exactly what happens right when you price your company against other software companies you're asking a very different question than when you're valuing a company your valuable company is saying given the fundamentals of this company is this company cheap or expensive when you're pricing a company the question you're asking is a very different one given these other companies I'm looking at and what other people are paying for these companies is this company cheaper expensive and you can see why the answers can diverge so there I did the pricing against the sector right can I price the stock against the market the entire Market why not it's a lot more companies that's a good news the bad news is a lot more things to control for but you can price and today I'm going to talk about the way in which you can price the stock against the entire Market given how the market is pricing every other stock and the answer you can get there can be actually different than the pricing you got against the sector so even within pricing depending on you know what the comparison is you can end up with very different conclusions so remember that about pricing you're asking and answering a very specific question that's conditional to what you're comparing your company to and that is both the strength and weakness of pricing yes then we circled on looking at when the dissertation for price in this case you can value what is the data return indirectly every time you do p these studies that look at what happens if you buy High P stocks and low PE stocks this means reversion this historically been reversed which is just a way of saying if you buy sectors with high p e ratios over time those PE ratios kind of meander down to the average so that's the evidence that that evidence kind of plays out over and over you're saying why don't people didn't take advantage of it because mean traversion is kind of this noisy long-term process you can be right in the long term but end up being wrong in the short term so I think that there is enough evidence over time of mean reversion but it's not a strong enough reversion and a predictable enough reversion to actually make money on it so let's turn back to slide 55 I think 56. okay so if you remember last session it's the most I mean that I'll be quite honest of all the sessions I teach in this class that session is the most tedious one because it's the algebra it's equations I'm glad it's done but you have to go through it it's a torture you have to go through and why we where do we go through it what is the objective when you take that disc dividend discount model and you do the algebra to come up with the intrinsic value equation for Price to Book and price earnings what's the end game there yes Lisa right in other words it gives you the questions you need to ask somebody if they tell you a stock is cheap right and that's critical in pricing that's why we go through it and on slide 55 I've taken eight different multiples because I'm sick and tired I don't want to do any more multiples but you get the picture now right if I ask you what's the driver EV to have it you should be able to do the algebra if I ask you what's a driver for EB to user so if any of you are in that space user-based companies try this out it's a very good way to come up with a list of questions to ask a user-based company about what the value of the user is so today I want to move to the next phase we've defined we've described we've analyzed we're ready to apply right and what does application mean answering two basic questions the first is given the firm that I'm trying to price what is a comparable foot you're saying that's absurd we know what it is it's other companies in the sector and that's what we're pretty close to 80 years and Wall Street that's what we've used as comparable folks what does it mean to price a software company I look at other software companies the price of utility I look at other utilities do we have to do that weather implicitly why do we do that what are we assuming about software firms that that means a shortcut or they that they have roughly the same fundamental the growth because ultimately the growth the risk the cash flow so implicitly we're hoping we're praying that companies within a sector are similar enough that we could compare are they though 50 years ago we did steel companies they all look roughly the same it's roughly the same stage today if you do utilities then roughly in the same stage of the cycle you take software companies to them you got Microsoft today you got Adobe in there you got startup software companies in there I think that starting assumption is already getting shaked you're saying what do we do about this what's a comparable firm in a discounted cash if you think in intrinsic value terms what's a comparable form it's a firm with similar cash flow similar growth and similar risk right if I went through 7500 us firms and I found verbs with similar cash flows growth and risk to you I would argue that's a much better list of comparables than doing what we're doing right now so I'll give you a couple of statistical ways of doing it because you can't eyeball the data so I'm going to go look through 7 500 companies but maybe start to rethink what we mean when we mean when we look at corporate books but even if you do everything right and after you've gotten the list of comparable firms you're going to face a challenge which is those companies have differences from your company higher growth the lower risk we need to figure out a way to control for those differences you know how equity research analysts do it right now they tell you a story so they'll give you a stock with a price earnings ratio of 18 the average for the sector is 15. they said but this is still a cheap stock because it has higher growth or lower risk and they leave the story as the explanation the promise that explains away the Gap then it doesn't tell me enough to tell me whether 18 is too high still or too low so today I want to talk about quantifying the difference and I started on this when we talked about you know PE ratios across countries so let's start with that question you decided to price your stock you're done with the DCF and you know you put it away and say I'm going to price my company hi professor uh we're sharing the difference thank you thank you for letting me know I still own the old screen thank you so let's talk about the sample that you're going to draw so you know those of you haven't access S P Capital IQ yet you haven't needed it for intrinsic valuation but in pricing it's going to be incredibly useful so let's say you get an s p Capital like you you're going to hit that screening tool up and down and you're going to get a whole host of criteria that you can screen on so you say okay I'm going to screen by geography I want to look at only us companies to click off us then and say you know what sector and you can pick a broad sector and pick all read so let's say you do the retail firm you can pick all retail firms you're going to say I'm going to go narrow and I'm going to focus only on building retail building supply retail you're doing Home Depot and then it allows you to screen based on market cap it's a Home Depot is a hundred billion dollar plus company I'm going to look for only building retail with a market cap greater than 100 billion this is good right and then you look at what comes through your screen and give you one company and you look at the company it says Home Depot this is not getting you very far so you try you see where this is going when when your first you know when you when you when you first start a screen you want to find companies just like your company say market cap same growth and you're very quickly going to find that for some companies it might work hard if you're I don't know uh a mid midsize software company you might be able to find 50 companies and if you can do that all the more power to you the challenge you will face is do I want to go narrow and find companies just like mine and end up with a small sample or do I want to be much more willing to let in companies that might be different from mine and end up with a large set which is better it depends on what you plan to do with this app if you plan to eyeball the data you know what I mean by eyeballing the data you want to look for companies and make these qualitative assessments you want small samples of companies just like yours but if you're willing to use statistical tools four companies are not going to do it you want to go to the large so you might try both you might do a small sample which you want to use to eyeball the data to price it but you also want might want to use a larger sample that captures differences across companies but that's always a trade-off the more you Define criteria narrowly the fewer companies are going to get through and the more willing you are to compromise the larger sample and at the limit you might say I want a really big sample I'm going to take every company in the market and talk about what happens when you do that but there is no X anti reason why one is right the other is wrong they're two different choices and once you get that sample you have to decide what you're going to going to do with that sample with the narrow samples as I said you often take the company and you do a very close assessment for the longest time in the U.S you know how Auto analysts work they had only three companies in the sample for the entire 20th century GM Ford and Chrysler they compared them across each other they compare them across time but that's it it was all qualitative because with three companies you can make judgments based on the three companies so think of that as a first you do direct comparisons of GM to four new create rules so the again through much of the 20th Century Auto analysts at Roots GM trades and a p e ratio about 25 higher than Ford for much of the 20th century GM was the more attractive company than Ford so it's p e ratio is 25 higher and they would make buy or sell recommendations based on a comparison the second is you get a little bigger 12 or 15 then you start to tell stories about how your company is special and deserves a higher PE Ratio or your company is you know has more risk and has a lower p ratio the third is you try to bring whatever variable you're concerned about that's the different across companies into your Market what am I talking about remember I talked about the origins of Peg ratios you can almost see that analysts in the 1970s looking at a sample of 40 companies looking at the PE Ratio saying this isn't working for me I'm supposed to buy growth companies I need to find a way to bring growth in hence was born the PEG ratio just be careful though because when you brought growth into the ratio remember you didn't create this clean multiple you created a multiple that didn't quite control for growth and ended up creating more problems than healthy and finally you can use statistics in what way you can have 500 companies in your sample right what are you worried about growth risk and cash flows return in equity you can essentially bring in those controls into your statistical techniques and essentially compare companies across very large samples so I'm going to play the role again of an equity research analyst I'm going to take you through a series of recommendations I'm going to give you now you have the tools to ask me the right questions so here's my first try I'm the beverage artist this is my sector it's an old example so don't be you know if the multiples look straight so there are the trailing piece expected growth and the standard deviation stock prices you're saying why aren't you giving us betas remember once you leave intrinsic valuation you're enterprising the way you measure risk can be completely your choice so with the bank you'd see me looking at tier one Capital ratios so whatever you think is the best measure of risk in the sector is what you're going to bring into the game so ready this is my sector I'm going to put out by recommendations on three companies Andre why Todd Hunter and Hanson natural Andre's wine makes the I think the champagne that you see the ad only at Christmas time watching the the ad actually gives you a headache I think it's that cheaper champagne I don't even know what they do and Hanson natural is of course the handsome service you see why I picked them right I'm a knife analyst why did I pick those three they trade at the lowest P ratios but is there a reason they're trading at such low PE ratios I've kind of given away the game but play along anyway what's the reason that uh tar Hunter and Andre is one have for trading at low P ratios the growth rates are the lowest in the sector so it's low growth what about Hanson actually it looks I mean think of a PEG ratio right 9.7 divided by 17. what's the problem there look at the standard deviation the highest risk again I'm not trying to explain things away but I'm saying in this case the pushback you would have is they look cheap but go ahead or stock prices but I could have used standard deviation and earnings if you felt that was a better measure of risk as I said the choice you make for measuring risk can be very sector specific as well because it's whatever you think about as risk so in Pharmaceuticals it might be the patent life left or the biggest Blockbuster drug because that's what you might worry about is the biggest risk so be creative in thinking about risk condition and the fact you now have to go collect the data on that risk measure so stocks look cheap but they have a good reason for being here but at this stage though all I can do is wave my hands and this is why I increasingly started drawing on statistic because I got sick and tired of on the one hand on the other hand but ultimately I've got to make a buy or sell recommendation so pick up any sector look down and see if you can see an obvious reason why a stock trades at the lowest price to book or the lowest DB to sales and it's usually going to stick out I get fired as a beverage analyst after that buy recommendation went out I land on my feet I'm now the Telecom ADR analyst let me give you some perspective until the 1980s and 90s the only publicly traded telecom companies in the world were in the US the rest of the world Telecom used to be owned by the government and then you had a whole host of privatization through the 1980s and 90s those companies became public companies but many of them had listings in the US and that's what the ADR compored the nice thing about adrs is in theory at least the earnings per share computed using gap for all of them so remember we talked about uniform rule Supply so I've computed the PE ratio for all of these companies again I'm going to play the role of an analyst and I said hey buy the cheapest stocks you can see where I'm going to go I'm going to go to indosat and telebras because they have the lowest P ratios these are all Telecom adrs but if you go down the list you notice that some of them are Emerging Market Telecom ADR so remember in the 1990s emerging markets were really emerging markets and the Divide between developed and Emerging Markets was huge and some are you know you've got the Danish Telecom company the British Telecom company so there are some developed Market ADR since some Emerging Market areas so play along with me we know the PE ratios are different one thing that worries you is the difference is in expected growth which are in the last second column the other thing that worries you is some of these are developed market telecoms and others are Emerging Market dollar costs indo-sided telegraphs have two things working against them one is they have low growth and the second is about Emerging Market companies so rather than do what I did in the Beverage Group where I kind of waved mine said I don't know what to do next I ran a regression my dependent variable is the p e ratio that's what I'm trying to explain there's an intercept ignore that there's a growth rate so basically that captures the growth effect how do I read the 121 for every one percent difference in growth across these telecom companies the PE increases by 1.21 so if your company has a five percent higher growth rate than mine I'd expect your PE ratio to be roughly six higher than mine 5 times 1.21 you're saying what is this this is a dummy variable you know the dummy variable is it takes on a value of either zero or one and I went through my my my data set of telecom companies and for the Emerging Market telecom companies I put no one and for develop Market telecom companies are put in a zero so telling the regression these are my Emerging Market companies these are my development companies are they different that's what the coefficient tells you in this case the coefficient is minus 13.85 what does that mean I take two telecom companies at the end of the 1990s they both have the same exact same growth rate one is a develop Market Telecom the other is an Emerging Market Telecom that the Emerging Market Telecom company has a p e ratio 13.85 lower than the developed Market Telecom family why because the market is pricing in country risk pricing in countries as opposed to an intrinsic valuation would have built it as a big risk premium had a higher discount rate yeah we're saying no we can't do that we're not going to let the market tell us how much it's discounted now is there the problem at zero one is I'm trading all Emerging Market companies as being in the same bucket is there a continuous variable I could have used for for a risk here I could have used a rating I could have used you know something else if I wanted to got a continuous measure at the time that I did this I really didn't have PR you know PRS risk course I had ratings but the problem with ratings is their alphabets right you can't put alphabets into regression you might have to convert them into a number I was too lazy that's why I made the zero one but zero one is actually very good when you have something discrete separating companies regulated versus unregulated companies it's a way in which you capture the risk yes well inflation affects all so in a sense you're saying High inflation countries with low inflation countries I could have but in the sense the I'm doing it all in in dollars in the US I'm not doing it in different currencies so if I'd done them by pulling PE ratios from localized markets I'd have had to deal with inflation and interest rate but here I'd have to do it everything was in a sense dollar rise including their growth rates if I went to inflation then I'd have to talk about nominal inflation changing those growth rates as well now why was I doing this because I wanted to see if intercept and telegraphs were cheap right if I take my telebras numbers for instance and plug it into that regression the 7.5 percent low growth rate the fact that it's an Emerging Market company I get a predicted PE of 8.35 remember it looked attractive at 8.9 times earnings after I control for the low growth and the high risk it actually is a little bit overvalued same thing for intersect both those companies look cheap but once you control for the difference in growth and risk they're overvalued I I mean it might be personal I feel much more comfortable with my pricing when I do this than when I tell a story and I go on the one because at the end of the storytelling I said I have no idea what I'm talking about anymore I can give a sense of direction but unless you have something so obviously mispriced you're kind of stuck so I'm not saying statistics should replace you doing things but it's a tool it's a tool that lets you control for differences and bring in those effects and sometimes a tool can surprise you could the Emerging Market dummy have had a zero coefficient and if you're doing pricing you know what you should do you should bend down to the market and say that might not make sense but I'm pricing things and if I'm pricing things I have to go with whatever people are pricing in so pricing is a two that I mean regressions are statistics or two that allow you to see what the market is paying for and what it doesn't care about so I get fired as a telecom ADR analyst after I put out that buy recommendation on telegraphs and into satin that money blew up I land on My Feet Again now I'm the European banking analyst pull all the numbers down for European Banks and banks are particularly either susceptible to Price to Book ratios because the book value for a bank actually means something right because it's driven by regulatory capital and everything is marked to Market so there's The Price to Book ratios for the banks again you want a low price to book ratio right but remember the companion variable for Price to Book and this is the advantage of doing this after the analysis part is I know exactly what I need to be looking for is return Equity so I put in the return Equity I did bring in the standard deviation stock price but in hindsight I wish I'd brought in something more Bank specific today if I were doing this regression for banks I would have Price to Book return Equity but what's the thing that blew up svb a duration mismatch right if I can now come up with a measure of how much of A bank's you know assets are invested in t-bonds and I put that in that becomes a proxy for how much should I worry about an svb like blow up at this back so look across and think about what to do with the numbers so first I'm going to do a low-tech way in which you find cheap companies so help me out here you want a low return net a low price to book right ratio in your company right in your cheap company you want a high return in equity and you want low risk so I'm going to take my sample and compute median values for the sample how does it help me I want to buy banks with the price to book less than the median with the return in equity higher than the median and a standard deviation lower than the median yeah that's that's my under bed I think not One Bank actually met all three criteria I could get two out of three but you know you get take what you can put my overvalued I'm going to look for banks that do the exact opposite trade at a price to book higher than the median have a return Equity lower than the median and a standard deviation that's higher basically that's worst possible combination that again it shows you the limits of eyeballing right you can do listen unless something sticks out obviously which very seldom happens you get crew out of three and you say well is that good enough so again I went back to my statistics rule book and you can see why desperation drives you back to statistics because I said I've given up this larger the sample and the less obvious the mispricing the more you have to go with nuanced differences a random regression of Christ above against return and equity and standard deviation while I'm doing all of this remember when you run these regressions check the T statistics because if you have a coefficient with a you know as I said last last session a t statistical point eight point seven just take it out of the regression otherwise you're going to get this noise driving your prediction so we look at the T statistics they're 3.3 2.33 they both are significant the signs are in the right direction higher return Equity stocks have higher price to book ratios higher standard deviations of low and that would be interesting today to see if investors are pricing in exposure at Banks into the pricing of banks I don't know the only way to check is to check the data so I get the r squared is 79 tells me that at least in this sector I'm able to explain a very high percentage of differences in Price to Book with the return Equity you're saying what if I have a sector where the r squared is only 23 you can't fight the data you see doesn't that make my pricing imprecise yeah that's not your problem I mean remember that you wanted to use intrinsic valuation somebody wants to use a multiple this is holding a mirror up saying do you really want to use a PE ratio doesn't work that well you can't get blood out of a store so what I'm saying is don't spend your time trying to make the r squared go up by throwing in stuff that shouldn't matter you really take the basics you come up with an r squared you hope it's higher so you get a better prediction but if it's slower remember as long as the T statistics is significant it's not that you cannot use a regression it's that you get a bigger range most statistics packages is it many tabs that you guys still have here at Stern I don't know what they're no but I don't know they also have SPSS I think they have a bunch of different statistics packages you can use as turn MBA they all will give you predictions that also give you ranges and with the lower R squares you just get bigger ranges so here's what I did I took my sample and I used my regression to get predicted Price to Book ratios just like I did for the country piece I took and what am I looking for stocks that trade at a price to book well below my predicted and there's a there's a pattern here that you know so if you look across the most overvalued stocks are all bunched up at the end and that's a red flag that there's that there's some that you're putting remember what's called a linear regression and to the extent that the relationship is not linear it's kind of giving a signal maybe you want to try something different I'll talk a little bit about non-linear regression but this is not a statistics class I want to get caught up in that so if you notice that pattern there's usually you know something that in your regression that might be pushing the limits of what he can get away with so we've looked at beverages we've looked at Telecom adrs who looked at Banks yes R squares and P statistics go together right when you get high r squared you get high P statistics it's so impossible to get a high r squared and Low T statistics it'll never come through there both affected by the same things which are you know how close are my predicted values to my actual values that's what the r squared measures the T the T statistics just break down the individual coefficients so you can have a high r squared variables and a very low key statistic on one so with a multiple regression it's a saying take the low T statistic variable out run it with just the two you get roughly the same r squared but now you have a prediction that might be a better one because you don't have the noise term impact yes yeah they're all linked together right because think of what we're doing here we're taking actual points we're taking a predicted point we're looking at the difference between your prediction your actual so that's a residual but the residuals are all zero you get an r squared of 100 so think of both as output from your data now that drives the regression they're coming out of the data that you put in and what the link is and how strong that linkage is like not necessarily right if you have something that moves together and they move together really well 18 you're going to get 100 r squared no if if the if the movement is perfect I'll tell you the less strong the link is the more you want the larger sample size because you worry about if the link is strong with 20 you're going to get it right so if you look at interest rates and p e ratios you don't need a large sample you put in 20 numbers you're going to see very quickly the link is strong enough curiously are the the other factor to keep in mind when you have a small sample the number of variables third to regression obviously the more I mean it's a mathematical reality the more variables I let you throw into regression the higher your r squared we get because I'm you're throwing in more stuff but if you have a small sample you got to get really that becomes really dangerous with a sample of 18 most I can get away with this too independent variables if I throw in a third one strange things will start to happen I might get a great looking regression but it's it's not going to work so here's my suggestion as you put together your samples if you end up with a sample of 20 21 22 companies who price your company stick with one or two variables in your regression because you've thrown every variable that's supposed there's no supposed to matter in other words don't look at that that as the analysis or price to book a chapter return Equity shut beta you should have growth ratio payout ratio you feel the urge to throw all for it before you do that check your sample if you have only 25 firms start with the strongest variable and very gingerly try a second one and then stop it doesn't have to be two of the four randomly the two Strongest Ones if you have a sample of 50 and you want to throw in all four do so but check to see that they're all still significant so it's almost you you try and you say so both the sample and your regression you might have to do it two or three iterations before you converge at something that works for you and there will be some of you who will find none of the regressions work as I said you can't fight the data in which case what should you do just compare to the average in the industry and say thank God I'm not pricing remember you get to decide what which one you're going to base your recommendation on and if you're having a really tough time getting your pricing nailed down it's going to be an input in which one do I trust more the intrinsic valuation of the price here I'm going to expand the sample a little bit more I took the 100 largest market cap companies in the US they do this almost every year I haven't done it this year if I get a chance I'll do it over the next week and send you the same it's fun to do because you take 100 largest market cap you get all kinds of companies you get software companies you get a few Banks you get a manufacturing company get a couple of insurance companies very different companies I take the price to book ratios and the return Equity it's got a scatter plot remember those from statistics you take each company so each of those points is one of the 100 companies and if you do this in a statistics package and you do a scatter plot almost every scatter plot but you know package that I see asked you a question do you want me to put a best fit lie through those points which is really a regression line say yes cost should nothing let it do it so do you want me to put confidence interval say Yes again because what it's doing then is it's taking the r squared of the regression and coming up with that 90th percentile in the 10th percentile see those two lines those are the con what do you see most of my 100 companies are falling between them these are the hundred largest market companies if they were all falling you know outside the line you should be really worried most companies are not going to be so massively mispriced that they're all notes so there are companies so that don't go fall above and below the line this was in 2010. so as I go through these companies I want you to think about because no for sure did you say there must be over value and development but before I do you do that I want you to ask is there something we could be missing because all I'm doing is looking at Price to Book versus return Equity right at the above the lines are these my overvalued undervalid stocks over I'm sorry overpriced under price they're my overpriced I've Google Infosys and Gilead Delia was a young growth pharmaceutical company what did they share in common their growth companies and maybe even intangible assets so already you're saying maybe I'm missing something in my regression remember when we looked at priced book we said it's a function of return Equity it's a function of growth it's a function of risk I've looked at only return equity high growth competition of High Praise to vote so your reaction is those might not be overpriced I'm just missing the growth part of the equation I'll give you a way to bring growth in if you want to but no then I go below the line and I get Conoco Nokia and Exxon Mo I don't even know why Nokia is there and okay at that point was a company that knew what it was doing its phone business was dying Conoco and Exxon Mobil the game you know antenna should start they're both oil companies and when you get two companies from the same sector looking undervalued they might be undervalued but the oil companies remember you need to take Price to Book and return Equity you're looking at net income in the most recent year and of oil prices surge during the year companies may look cheaper it looks like I'm just explaining away the difference with the 100 largest market cap companies I'm going to try to explain away the difference is first before I do something rash and in this case at least it looks like you can explain away the white divergences and most of the companies fall within those Banks now in case I don't like three-dimensional graphs they make me dizzy but you can do a three-dimensional scatter plot in this plot I've taken Price to Book on that axis return and Equity so think of this as a cardboard box right three-dimensional Your Price to Book return Equity expected growth rate I want you to tell me where in that box your cheapest stocks would be it certain Price to Book you want low price to book High pricable you want low price to book you want High return Equity low return equity I return equity and you want high growth or low growth so basically you want low price to book higher return Equity hey you're looking somewhere in here right that's where your cheapest stocks would be there's nothing there the closest I get is Time Warner and remember the closer you get the cheaper you are it's actually that's why I said it's fun doing it I'm not sure you get great investment recommendations looking at the top hundred companies but if you did this with a hundred mid cap companies or a hundred small cap companies who knows what you could find right because you can get some massive mispricing happen on those companies are under the radar so try it out pick a hundred companies in a market which might not be liquid 100 companies you know take Latin America take 100 largest Argentine company 100 largest Brazilian companies now put them in a sample see how much you can explain and whether you get some kind of investment judgment coming out yes sorry part of our industry because there's so much inertia in terms of it but let's yeah it's a good point let's say you take intangible companies with intangibles what what happened to the book bag they're good too low or too high they're going to have two lower Book value because so The Price to Book ratios are going to have that same Book value though that Low Book value what is it going to do to your return equity it's going to make a return Equity look high one of the nice things about pairing companion variables is whatever you do to screw up the denominator and one is also going to screw up and that's why we need to bring compromise otherwise tech companies always look expensive in a Price to Book basis standing alone and Banks might look cheap so this by bringing in the companion variable is what allows us to compare across sectors with very different capitalization rates because whatever since we commit on one also show up a sense on the other side exactly so in a sense you could say what is the market doing so I think you the other alternative is to capitalize r d but the reason we do pricing is we don't want to go through that data so it's too much work we want to do something quick and dirty and this way it comes one of the interesting things you can see is you know we made this big deal about how accountants capitalize leases I remember when that discussion happened how the market would now readjust it was acting in the assumption that markets were stupid enough to do what accountants were doing before 2019. you know the effect on pricing at retail firms after capitalized leases was invested Capital went up debt ratios went up but the pricing remained roughly the same because Market said we knew this already you guys are just late to the party we've already been doing it for as long as leases have been around so one of my tests on whether these accounting rule changes even make a difference is actually look at how it plays out in the price yeah and if you want to do risk because that's the other uncontrolled variable I don't think it should be a big variable look at the 100 largest market cap companies because you shouldn't have immense differences in risk you can do Price to Book return you say can I do Price to Book return Equity risk and growth of four-dimensional graph there's a way to do it you'll get like 12 Scatter Plots don't even go there I mean just it looks impressive you know but if you're trying to make investment judge it's just going to make you dizzy yeah and finally I took those hundred companies and while I cannot do a four-dimensional graph I can do a regression with three variables right so there's my regression r squared of 66 I thought that was pretty impressive that I could take a hundred very diverse companies and explain 66 of the variation in price to book with return Equity growth and beta these are these are not kitchen sink regressions you know what I mean you know you've all we've all been guilty of kitchen sink regressions in statistics classes what's the objective in a kitchen sink regression we're going to get the r squared higher so you throw in variables because they push up the r squared let's throw in the height of the CEO that push it up the r squared let's leave that in there and if your end game is explaining things away because you throw in variables that's that's not my end game because I want to leave things that are not because of fundamentals unexplained because that's where my money comes from saying why am I paying a higher PE ratio for a company after a control for the fact that there's less risk and higher growth and a higher return equity and if you look at the coefficients the signs are all the way I expect I know I keep saying that you think when is that going to be different and a couple of regressions you're going to see me have a sign that throws me off because it's the wrong direction higher beta stocks have lower price to book ratios higher growth stocks have higher price to book ratios higher return Equity stocks of higher price supercratios the most compelling of the variables is actually return equity and beta actually drops out of the regression I should probably rerun the regression without Beta in it because it's that you're saying why doesn't beta matter it should there is no should when you're doing pricing the market says I don't care you should care either I mean if you really care about risk and bringing that in the right way just stick with intrinsic valuation pricing is what it is it could be it could be but the hundred largest market cap I might still be stuck with the fact that there aren't enough differences and risks there which are wide enough to explain differences in pricing so just maybe that maybe the fact that with this with the sample that I'm looking at beta doesn't matter that much or it could be that maybe the market is using some of the proxy for us remember I said the market doesn't have to think in intrinsic value terms right the market might say large companies are safe and small companies are risky and then you throw in market cap it might actually have a higher T statistic than any risk variable you throw it yeah yes right so to make it a return how what did you have to do you have to compare that predicted PE to the actual PE and the predicted p is higher than the actual P that difference percentage difference becomes a rough measure of what you will make as an excess return if you buy the stock at the lower price to book and what happens the market agrees with your regression and decides to move everything to a predicted value unfortunately I haven't found a way to make markets do that yet but that part so it becomes a return once you act on it and you find stocks that trade a low price earnings or low price level so this was my last year's 100 largest market cap stocks as I said I've been too lazy to do this this year I do it at least once a year so it's about the time of the year I should do it so there's my regression line out of points I couldn't find a single company that fell outside the outer lines last year so everything fell within the so again I mean I'm not this is not good or bad it is what it is and you know and you can find so this the com stocks that fall above the line are your overvalued and Below or undervalued the question is are they overvalued or undervalued enough that you can statistically point to them you could be a one-person hedge fund right and tell me what you would do if you if this was the tool in your hand buy the undervalued but what makes for a hedge fund you can also shortly overvalue then you get down your knees and you pray and hope that they all move to the regression line because then no matter what happens to the market you're going to make money right because this is about convergence so when you're about quad hedge funds this is basically what they're doing of course they have statistics PhD so they brought in the heavy artillery and the bombs and the the nuclear missiles in their disposal they're not using linear regression but they're doing effectively the same thing is you could think of this gigantic scatter plot that they've created with all the data and all the tools and then they're buying the undervalued selling the overvalued and whole pay booking budgets it's a pricing game it's not a valuation game and this is why the hedge fund I'm not surprised that they do don't do intrinsic valuation because you know if you get you can get the pricing right you can get the convergence rate who cares what the value of something is and how it plays out of attack I think 90 confidence interval so basically it allows you almost the statistics package will ask you whether you want 95 90 67 67 will basically mean one third of the time you're wrong so the range will get it'll become tighter if you use 67 but I use the 90 confidence interval they are you can see the r squared was actually much lower in this regression there's a lot more Divergence across which is part of why the if you look at the the width of the this is why I said if you have low R squares you're going to see a much bigger band it makes it more difficult to rule out that this is just statistical noise that's why you know if you ask me is the r squared of 16 worse of course it's worse because it gives me a wider band but it's worse because I can't make decisions based on it because everything starts to fall within the match so I get fired as the hundred largest market cap analyst I don't think there's such an analysis so now I'm in my fifth job I'm now the trucking analyst I'm moving down into the most boring sector in the world this is my tracking sector that's my EB to ebitda multiple for these sectors again remind me EB turbotage low is cheap so I'm going to put out a buy recommendation I picked Rider systems why not kllm I don't even know what kllm does write a systems I've seen the trucks on the roads a mild form of familiarities I I know that name and it's trading at 2.81 times ebitda this is good right six times I've been done this is 2.8 times Evita you already have the ammunition to ask me questions so rule out the reasons why this company deserves to be changed one is growth right so you see what's the growth rate these are all trucking companies in the U.S roughly the same low growth of five percent growth so that's not the issue keep moving what is the very very the first variable we talked about with the EB debit card because it's a pre-tax number we asked about the tax rate right you didn't actually what the tax rate is but you know again if I could show you the effective tax rates they all look the same so it's not the growth it's not the tax rate I looked at the return on Capital hoping that you know this company had a really low return Capital that explains it away it wasn't returning capital which brought me to reinvestment and there's a there's something about trucking businesses that I've got to kind of fill in the details the way trucking companies reinvest they replace their entire fleet every five six seven years why because you get discounts if you if you do a entire you know so ask me the question about reinvestment rather than ask me what the reinvestment is how would you reframe that question how old is Rider's Fleet right if it's got a really old Fleet it's Evita it's going to be really low you know why because you know exactly what's coming after you buy the stock because you think it's cheap about two weeks later they're going to borrow 5 billion and buy a whole bunch of new trucks and there goes your Evita back up to seven this was actually I pulled it off an actual equity research report he said buy Riders cheap EB Tabitha and actually went through the annual reports of trucking company they actually report the age of the fleet all I had to do is add that extra column to my spreadsheet and the missed pricing went away so that's what I meant about lazy pricing it's not that you know you should use EBT but ask the questions at least before you put a buyer recommendation in this case the the reason you write a systems as a low EB debitiser at the oldest Fleet it was on the verge of replacing that Fleet and issuing Capital the minute you do that remember your EB is going to start to go up with that four billion dollars and all of a sudden 2.81 times ebitda becomes seven times habitat so when you use a multiple and people ask what's the best multiple I don't care what multiple use as long as you ask the right follow-up questions because that's really what's going to separate whether you're doing good pricing or shorty pricing so now I'm getting used to getting fired I get fired as the trucking analyst I'm not the grocery store business talk about boring to even more boring right characterized grocery store business in the US low growth high growth no growth low margin high margin talk about boring stories right I mean how exciting can your story be if you're telling if you're valuing Kroger low growth low margin nothing's going to change look no so I looked at the pricing of groceries and this was I think in 2000 Maybe 2007. so they're all the grocery stores I did a scatter plot and then I and they're all the grocery stores nicely behaving themselves and then there's an outlier that is the original Whole Foods I'm in Whole Foods through I mean grocery analysts were thrown to it to a loop by holds Foods because it was very different from everybody else right why that this much higher margin strategy a higher price strategy and their initial reaction was the stock is massively over you know but then they try to explain away but it has a high margin therefore it's okay so in 2007 I first looked at Whole Foods I I looked at that but then I I'm going to stick with price to sales I know it's not internally I should have used EBT sales I did a price to sales regression I plugged in the higher margins that Whole Foods added to that came up with the predicted price they said and I said you can tell me all the stories you want about high margins they can explain why Whole Foods should have a higher price sale but not what it's trading it and then I forgot all about it a year later I Revisited the regression is all the you said where the heck is Whole Foods it's gone from way above the line to almost the lowest price stock in the land why they had some bad surprise happen the stock price collapsed this is what happens when you get a disrupter in a place that com that investors don't understand they overshoot and then they undershoot and there's Whole Foods in 2010 there is it I think it falls close to the line right now there's back to being overpriced 2007 2008 it's almost like watching a manic it's it's really a manic depressive stock right not there's no middle ground thing get some something to kind of soothe your moods and finally you get to 2012 I think I've taken it out Whole Foods is right on the line version It's people understanding how to price a higher margin stock it takes a while and almost every time I see a new player entry Market with Tesla and the automobile business they shoot no overshoot undershoot it takes a while which you might think of as a bad thing but that's your opportunity as an investor because when you value these companies you're going to see that same kind of it's one reason why I keep valuing Tesla every year I get a whole lot of abuse for doing it but to me it's it's a stock that will take a while to get it right especially I had a CEO kind of distracts you along the way that kind of adds to the mispricing by 2012 markets had learned how to price Whole Foods and then 2015 I take a look at the grocery business again and now there's a new player in town company called sprouts and on the west coast it's the new entrant into the higher price higher margin business it's like whole foods without being Whole Foods it's a very different kind of business model I haven't tracked Sprouts since but my guess is by 2023 people have figured out how to price Sprouts Whole Foods is now gone once Amazon bought it but sometimes it's good to track a company over time especially if it's a company that's different from the traditional companies and see how long it takes investors to learn how to price the company so let's say you've we've seen all these regressions one of the nice things everything something works right to explain the price so you get ready you're going to do your pricing you're sure you're going to get a regression with a 60 r squared that's nice regression you plug the numbers in you put a scatter plot it's actually in 2000 when remember the Amazon valuation I showed you at the same time I decide to price Amazon by looking at other.com companies I did a scatter plot of price to sales against net profit margin again I should have probably done EB to sales and operating much not much of a difference in this sector because very few companies and I looked at the scatter plot my stomach dropped what do you see here a shotgun blast right that's basically if you ask me who cannot fit a line I have no idea what kind of line would fit if I run a regression of price to sales against net margin what kind of R square do you think I'm going to get a really crappy r squared undaunted I decide to run the regression anyway and it didn't surprise me r squared was four percent saying hey what are you doing why are you running a regression on us we don't relate to each other and even scary you look at the coefficient on the net margin it's negative how would I read it the more negative your margin the higher your price to sales ratio I think on a few.com companies took this to heart you lost money we can lose even more you lost a billion we can lose two it sounds absurd but it reflects the fact that this is a young business nobody is pricing companies based on what they made last year what are they pricing these companies on Hope what they think they will make in the future how much they will grow and also the presumption that some of them will fail and some of them will succeed some of you have sectors like this you know young companies Cloud companies AI companies your regressions are going to look like by regression so I'm going to give you a couple of ways in which you can still do pricing in this sector because you still have to do pricing the first is to look past those traditional very rigid ways of price to say you know EV to sales versus margin Price to Book against return equity and think about what investors are looking at when they price these companies so when I looked at.com companies in 2000 I said they're not looking at margins last year they want high growth companies over low Growth Company so through an Revenue growth I also factored in the scaling effect which is if you're a million dollar company you can trade at 100 times revenues and some of these.com companies did but as they get bigger you can't keep trading at 100 times revenues because your base gets much bigger so I threw in the level of Revenue and then I thought about is there some way I can bring in a failure risk in here remember I can't do this individually with each company like Edna DCF and I thought about how young tech companies of those days and still Fair they don't fail because they fail to make a debt payment they fail because they run out of cash so I threw in how much cash these companies had as a personal revenue is my presumption being the more cash you have the greater the chance of survival in fact an analyst used to have this cash burned rate where they figured out how many months of cash you had and the moments of cash you had the higher your pricing was that this was my very around the regression I got an r squared of 32 percent I was ecstatic in this sector if I can explain 32 percent of the pricing I am a this is way better than what I expected if you look at the T statistics it turned out the scaling effect was actually weaker than I thought it was I might as well take that out of the regression Revenue growth did matter higher Revenue growth companies had higher price no Revenue multiples and lower Revenue growth and the more cash a company had as a percent of revenues the higher the the pricing was I plugged the numbers in for Amazon into this price and I got a predicted price to sales ratio for Amazon of 30.4 it was trading at 25.6 times revenues So based on my pricing what am I finding Amazon is under pressure let's reuse the word price yet it was under price at the same time that I did my BCF remember the value I got was 35 the stock was at 84. a stock was undervalued and overpriced and a year later I don't look for Vindication I have been Vindicated in both gods the stock was down so the under valuation was right but it was down only 80 percent you're saying what do you mean down only 80 percent the rest of the sector was down 95 you won you lost less and that's the thing about winning and pricing winning and pricing doesn't make mean you make money this means that you lost less money than everybody else and if you're judged on a relative basis that's all you need to do right so when you do pricing keep that in mind you're making a judgment that reflects what everybody else is paying and it's going to show it to that it's going to be a range so basically that 30 point something that I got for Amazon I should have shown you the range I get around it was like 20 it was basically 25.5 to 35 it's a pretty wide range because the r squared was low if the r squared had been 80 the range would be 28 to 32. so actually I was at the very I was at the very bottom of the range I barely made it below that line but the higher the R square the tighter your prediction can become it becomes easier to act on a prediction then because more things are going to fall outside yeah the second is to do what's called forward pricing this is what every VC does right what is what's the forward pricing what's the trouble you're having with these companies right now there's not much substance there not much in revenues not much the earnings are negatives and what do you hope will happen to these companies that they will get bigger they will get more profitable over time you did this in your DCF right you took a money losing company into many money making company so rather than pricing based on today's numbers you price on numbers in year five or ten well you have more subs than the company this sounds like an easy out right you take Revenue using your 10. you apply an EV to sales multiple you get no this is what Bankers do for their terminal value but here you're doing it much more honestly you're doing it as a price perfectly okay but remember there's many a slip between the cup and the lip so if you come up with this forward pricing of 150 billion in your debt remember you're buying the stock today right but part of reason I'm just going to Discount the 150 billion back today that's that's the start at least considering time value money but think of what else you're not factoring in what else is missing if you just discount the forward price back to data discount rate are all these Young Money losing companies going to make it to your debt that failure rate remember I told you you thought you were running away from all the things I was trying to get you to do in a DCF and doing pricing you're doing forward pricing of a young company you got to think about failure rate right that's not fact today what else is not tracked it what do these young companies have as cash flows in years one two three four often big negative cash flows that require that you raise Equity right you see why does it affect me because you're buying a share of the stock today that share is going to get deluded so about I think in 2015 a Tesla valuation that it's actually one of my very first Tesla valuation or The Terminal value of 69 billion and my value today was about 8 billion people said where did all that money go so I actually took my terminal value and actually started working backwards say this is how much you lost for Pure time value of money this is how much you lost for risk because if you think about you what do you charge above the risk-free rate this is how much you lost because there was delusion so what I'm trying to say in a kind of long-winded ways when you get a forward pricing or a forward value for your company you have to think about all those slices coming out and the further out in the future number is the more of that value you're going to end up losing and by the time you get to today's number you might end up with one tenth of that number or one twentieth of that number if you have a high growth money losing company yes I did with my DCF because in a DCF it's easy to do right because you know to break out the the risk part all I did was I first discounted the cash flows to the risk free rate I come up with the value that says the pure time value then I discount it back at the cost of capital that difference is risk and then because of the negative cash flows I discarded the negative cash flows that's a dilution effect so in the DCF actually I can do it and what I'm saying is when you're doing pricing this all happens implicitly and this is what what terrifies me when people use forward pricing of young companies they wave their hands if even if they but if you ask them how much is the delusion going to affect me they can't answer that because they without doing the cash flows and thinking about the time you cannot really answer those questions so keep that you know keep those factors in mind as you press so when you can when when you think about all the multiples I've used so far all the my tips I used to have built up an accounting number revenues operating income net income and those are the multiples we most often see in use but if you have a company which has revenues that are negligible then often you'll see a shift away from the accounting numbers to something that could drive those revenues I'm talking about market value per user market value per subscriber you say is that okay if the market is pricing users that's what driving and your job is to price companies guess what you've got to follow the script in 2013 when uh Twitter went public I did a discarded cash flow evaluation of Twitter it's on my website in fact I reposted it two years ago a year ago when Elon targeted Twitter I put the original valuation and I price Twitter in 2013. I did that price Twitter I looked at others online advertising companies at that time you know companies like Facebook which were publicly traded I got their Market values so those are my publicly traded companies are my market values they all got their money primarily or or a big chunk of it from advertising and then I collected all the accounting numbers that are typically used not Revenue I looked at net income and operating income inhabitat and then I also went and this is actually I had to go outside the financial statement and I found how many users each of these platforms used I was completely agnostic I'd say I'm going to let the market tell me what it's pricing at saying how are you going to answer the question if I wanted to answer the question what is the market caring about the most what's the statistical tool I'm going to call on first I want to see what drives market cap or Enterprise Value I did a correlation metrics I said tell me what you correlated with I don't care what you are but I want to get so if you look at the First Column we can see what's driving market cap or Enterprise Value and especially Enterprise Value if you look across both you could see on both those variables the item that best explains differences in pricing and Enterprise Value is number of users so I went back to the page and I took my Enterprise Value and divided by number of users cev per user the median value was about a hundred dollars there are high and low numbers wire numbers higher for some than others well remember they are the value I'm going to be willing to pay for you so will depend on the lifetime value of a user so this is the Market's estimate of how much is an Uber ride of a worth versus a Lyft Rider and a Facebook user worth as opposed to you know and this is how the pricing worked is that about a hundred dollars per user Twitter at 240 million users on the date of their IPO so guess what my initial price input would have was I took 240 divided multiplied by 100 which gave me 24 billion and I'm said I'm done you think that is so sloppy that was actually close to what they were in public at 24 billion dollars don't make pricing more sophisticated than it has to be right it's a data driven process it's not what should be in there it's what's in there what do markets care about do I like pricing no I mean I'd prefer to do intrinsic valuation but I need to understand pricing if I'm buying a social media company and I know that the pricing is driven by user count I've got to factor that into my decisions as to when I might buy the company or how much I've paid for the company or how quickly the adjustment will happen so even if you don't like the fact that markets price companies based on users and downloads and subscribers if it does it's good to know what that process looks like so take a look at those seven examples from the beverage thing where I wave my hands all the way to the users and kind of you know you get a sense of what pricing is pricing is you know there's no model there's no Theory it's really data driven and the problem right now is we're not using the data we're using average PE and telling a story you know we don't have to do that anymore use the data better now once you start to control for differences across companies you very quickly realize why do I stay sect and focused why can't I bring every company in the market and started every year I go through an exercise I try to look at different or you know what what explains p e ratios across all U.S stocks Price to Book ratios across all Global stocks in other words I run a regression across the entire market now part of me says but they're very different companies but if I control for differences in growth risk and return Equity I should be able to compare and if there are differences I cannot explain away that tells me that there are some segments of the market that are being mispriced rather simply because people are taking a sector and overpricing it or underpricing so I decided to do this when the first time I decided to do this before I ran the regression I wanted to make sure I wasn't going to get my hopes up too much so if you're trying to explain PE ratios remember the growth and risk and payout the variables that should drive Peak which of those do you think is is going to dominate in the market growth so that's what I saw I said let me see what the scatter plot looks like between PE and growth this is what the PE growth scatter plot looks like for U.S companies at this is there a positive slope yeah I guess so but it's an incredibly noisy relationship right it's it's like you know I don't know what to make of that so already I can see what the r squared is going to look like in the regression if this is my strongest variable and this is what it looks like I'm not expecting 90 r squared my expectations are coming down significantly even important regression but around the regression anyway I got an r squared of 25 I was actually pleasantly surprised I was expecting a lower R square 25 of variation in PE ratios across all U.S stocks can be explained by growth beta and payout ratio again I'm not doing a kitchen sink regression I'm staying with those three variables let's look at the coefficients higher growth companies have higher P ratios make sense good D statistic significant 10.42 higher beta companies have higher p e ratios wait that doesn't make any sense don't do something stupid like go and say the plus doesn't make sense let me put a minus in front of the two you can't do that right don't mess with the data to make it match your price it is what it is it will talk about why this is happening because clearly higher risk companies should have lower P ratios that doesn't seem to be happens there have and higher payout ratio companies have higher p ratio which actually makes sense higher payout for a given growth rate is more efficient statistical significance in all three variables r squared of 25 percent you know how much you remember when you about linear regressions in statistics but when you run linear regressions the first question you're always asks is is this okay it's a relationship non-linear they're actually statistical tests for non-linearity can run with PE and growth it's not a big deal it is pretty close linear but with other ratios it might be combination the second is when you run a regression the coefficients are going to keep shifting on you it's called non-stationary the data keeps moving you're getting a relay regression that will work for the moment but very quickly Fall Apart and there's a third word that you often hear in statistics classes that you try to forget very quickly because this is what the hell does that even mean it's called multicollinearity and here's what it's talking about when you run a multiple regression the independent variables are supposed to be independent of each other and if they correlate with each other it's called multicollinearies I remember listening to this Statistics so who the hell cares I should have listened better what are my three variables in my regression payout growth and beta there isn't a snowballs chance in hell that these are going to be encoded with each other why high growth stocks will tend to have low payout ratios and Hiatus in fact there's a they're all in fact you can't find Three Financial variables that are uncore with each other because the nature of business is what drives one often drives the other and I can back that up if I take the the the the the the the the and I have a correlation metric somewhere I'll show you the correlation Matrix you'll see that you don't see zeros as the correlation between them you're saying why does that matter remember you saw that Beta had a positive coefficient let's suppose a high growth companies all have high balance what does a computer see when you feed in data it sees four Columns of data right it doesn't know one is called you can call them whatever you want but in the computer's head it's just data if your high growth companies all tend to have high betas you blame the computer if it gets confused about what beta is measuring at some point in time in fact beta here is becoming a better proxy for growth than it is a proxy for risk and in the regression what you're getting is two variables measuring growth one called growth and the other called beta and there is the explanation for the positive coefficient so as you look at each of these you know of course you know so when you run this regression of course you want to stop and make sure that the coefficients are statistically significant in my case they were all statistically significant for the us but I think when I ran it in Japan the beta dropped out and I ran in Europe so I actually had to prove the regressions in some of the countries because they were not statistically significant why leave noise terms in and the second is an issue that can happen statistically but can create problems in pricing that intercept from the regression is output from the regression my intercept I think was 8.63 which means when I estimate a p e ratio for a company I start with 8.60 and then add all these elements can you have a negative intercept and regression you can but if you do when you price companies it can create a problem let's say you get a negative intercept with minus 10. I've actually run regression of the negative intercept of minus 10. and then you start to predict PE ratio starting with minus set you can end up with a predicted P of -2 right doesn't it so sometimes when you get big negative intercepts it's a problem when you do predictions and there's a quick fix for it it's not a perfect fix but it's quick fix almost every regression package including excel's own in internal regression packages in data analysis allows you to run your regression without a constant it's a check you put out and I don't want a constant it'll rerun the regression through the origin through xero it's not CR it's not you know particularly good statistical practice why because you've taken your best fit line and moved it to make it make so you're getting a less best bit line but in return you get zero intercepts so if you have an intercept that's creating trouble you could rerun the regression through xero and that effectively will give you take take care of the problem it'll give you a less robust regression but one that's more usable and finally here's the correlation Matrix that I've put so if this were a perfect regression you know what this Matrix should look like all of the independent variables the the correlation between them should have been zeros but they're not there's your multi-collinearity right there see what do I do about it if you this were a statistic class you could spend six sessions on you can try this I'll tell you what I do I just let it be and here's why that beta coefficient bothers me because the wrong direction but you know what you can still use these regressions for predictions the collective regression still works where the beta measures risk or is the second measure of growth I can still use them for predictions it's not perfect but no it is what it is so if you have a regression you get the wrong sign don't spend too much time trying to fix it there are statistical fixes that can require you to con but ultimately once you do all of that you end up with these convoluted complex regressions that you can't explain intuitively to people so here's the end game though you're saying why am I running this regression because I want to price stocks if I came to you with a stock like Disney and say hey is Disney overpriced underpriced today relative to the market I could take my market regression plug in the numbers for Disney into that regression and come up with the predicted p actually I did this in this year's regression I'll get it 21.43 plugging in Disney's beta Disney scroll thread you say what do I do with that if Disney were actually trading at 31 times earnings and my predicted p is 21. and if I wanted to I could get a range around this to make sure that it's not statistical noise I would conclude Disney is overpriced relative to the market and how growth risk and pay are being pressed now I wasn't kidding when I said you could be a one-person hedge fund you can run this regression you can get predicted prices for every stock in the market and then look at the 10 most underpriced and the 10 most overpriced and if your basic regression is sound or hope that they can start to move towards your regression line so if you go to my website I mean this is I don't want any of you running Market regressions because it is bulk unless you want to because you have Capital IQ you can download everything so if you want to run it on a small Market I would recommend a market like Spain or market like you know Argentina or Brazil Market where you have relatively manageable number of companies pick a variable I would say Price to Book or EV to sales the price earnings always has the lowest r squared it's the toughest of the multiples to explain because the earnings number is too volatile pick either revenues or you know or Book value download the numbers for that market and if nothing else it'll make you appreciate statistics more and say I wish I'd spend more time in that class and perhaps go back and revisit that because that's actually something you need to have in your toolkit one final point and we'll end for the day if you look at the coefficient that and that regression on the growth rate I think the coefficient I got for the growth rate was 0.462 think of that remember I talked about the equity risk premium is the price of risk in the market the coefficient you see on growth is how much the market is willing to pay for a one percent growth rate I've kept track of that number over time and this graph I've reported both the equity risk preview which is the price of risk and that coefficient and growth which is how much the market is willing to pay for growth the price of growth so think of yourself as a high growth high-risk company what does Nirvana look like to you you want a low price for risk a low Equity risk premium and a high price for growth right because the market is paying a huge price for growth that's basically what 2000 look like at the peak of the.com Boom your risk premiums are tiny the price of risk was price of growth was high you're a high growth high risk company I paid 500 times earnings your worst case scenario for that company is the equity risk premium source and the price of growth drops off because now you're not getting paid much for growth you're getting punished for being risky 2023 look closer to that at the start of 2023 it's improved sets so if I re-run this regression now my guess is the growth coefficient has gone up Market seem to be willing to pay for growth again but we started this year with the market saying hey growth not that impressed risk I care a lot so that actually is a combination I keep my eye on when I think about why a growth companies doing better or worse in the market is that combination is what drives the pricing of high-risk high growth companies so we're very close to enter pricing next session I'm going to mop up pricing I'm going to show you what the multiples look like globally and then we're going to move on to valuing private companies and and look you know I think first asset based valuation comes first some of the parts liquidation valuation but we're getting to that end game we are we're mopping up and bringing things to back under the table so pretty much cover everything so I will see you on Monday [Music] 
yeah yeah um thank you thank you anymore okay folks a quick reminder your third quiz is a week from Wednesday so it's next week the 26th and once you hit the 26th we're on you know we're three more sessions of classes and then the project is due May 8th and the finalists May 11th so everything's going to come at you which effectively is my way of saying if you want to get caught up on things this is the week to do it so if you have lots of other stuff planned move them out of the way get this done because uh in the pricing as I said should not take that long if you're willing to invest a few hours in it now somebody asked me where's the group part of this group project there's very little group work involved in this group project it's mostly on your own the only thing groupie about it if you can call it a group project is eventually you'll have to bring your group projects together and the only reason I keep it as a group is so I'm not the only one nagging everybody in a group because if you have people who are lagging in your group you might want to nag them as well because they'll eventually get it done always gets done but there will be people who infuriate You by working only on that last weekend and you have everything ready to go and not much you can do you can do only what you can do you can control your own project so let's continue with the discussion today we're going to finish up pricing there's not much left to do I'm going to show you the market regressions across regions but we're going to start you know we're going to start and complete what I call Asset based valuation we value a company based on its pieces so let me start with a very simple question you take a cup like Coca-Cola you valid as a company right but Coca-Cola is in 72 different countries every continent could you value Coca-Cola by geography North American operations Asian opera Europe what's the advantage of doing that of breaking down Coca-Cola geographically it valuing individual geography that get a sense why the value right wrong and also it allows you to and also you could very growth rate so Asia is growing and the US is mature you can use different different you know different growth rates different costs of capital in fact anytime you have a multi-business company you can the nice thing about a present value is it's additive you know what I mean by that you value the whole or you can value it in pieces and in theory at least you could argue that valuing a company and pieces should give you a more precise valuation then value it as a composite because you take these big companies you value them as a composite whole you're making a sub so let's let's say the way we compute Equity risk we take a weighted average right you know the problem with that though is that I never mentioned your weights can change over time if you're growing fast in Asia and you're mature in the US over time and who has the time to work out what the weights will be one year from now to whereas if you do a geographical base valuation you don't have to worry about weights each part has its own growth rate the compo So in theory you can you can ask why don't we do this with every company break it down into pieces and value each piece as a catch though right to Value Coca-Cola geographically I need information geographically like what every single item operating income capex depreciation working capital everything we need to Value an individual company now I have to do individually think of how much you struggle to do one story in one company think of doing this for five geographies and you're going to very quickly recognize that this requires a lot more information it's a trade-off most of the time the trade-off is going to lead you to Value the composite company because most companies don't break down information on a piece by piece basis in enough detail for you to be able to do the piece by piece valuation let's follow up on that I mean one of the things we're going to talk about today is what's called some of the parts valuation in fact there's an acronym that we've used sotp and never the first few times I said what the heck is that some of the pieces and you could argue that there are people who might care about some of the pieces either because you want to take over a company and break it up into pieces or because they want to make an investment judgment eventually so let's assume that you can value a company as a composite and you could value the company as a sum of the parts which of the following is going to be the result you're out first is the sum of the parts has to be equal to the value of the company is it possible some of the parts is greater than the value of the company in which case what has to be true or can the sum of the parts be less than the value you get for the company if I replace value with price it can be all three if I truly value a company I should really get the same value because values value whatever concerns me so but with price you're absolutely right the price can be equal the price can be great if the price is greater than the sum of the parts you might you know say there are differences because the corporate status add some value if the price is less though it creates a bit of an Arbitrage opportunity right because to the extent that you're right you can buy the company break it up sell out you know the pieces go for whatever they're worth it should be greater than the price you paid for the company so this is actually an argument for people buying up com I mean Saudis be targeted now for like a decade people have talked about how it's worth more as a sum of the spots last year before Bob Iger came back to Disney there were people talking about how Disney was worth more than as the sum of its parts as it was over the individual competition so you'll see equity research analysts do what they called some of the parts valuation I'm going to argue that most of the time they don't do any sum of the parts valuation they do good they do some of the Parts pricing you know what that means they take each piece of the company they'll price it by doing what applying a multiple it's actually back of the envelope the kind of thing you would do after a dinner you had three drinks and somebody says what do you think Disney's worth pull up the envelope you pull up the Epitaph for each part you multiply by the multiple for each part it's not the kind of thing you do at most dinners but you know the dinner with the right person maybe Carl I can and he says what do you think but it's not particularly detailed So today we're going to talk about actually doing a sum of the parts valuation and what it involves and I'm going to use a company called United Technologies company that used to be called the poor man's G but now I think it's a rich man she given how badly she is for fallen it's a it's a conglomerate it's a multi-business company in you know in multiple businesses we're going to do an actual sum of the parts valuation and as we go through to go to see why most people don't even try this even if the information that's a lot of messy assumptions and a lot of work a lot of calculations to go through so let's turn to I think page 94 which is where I left you so I talked about using that regression coefficient on growth to get a measure of the price of growth so let me review again you run the regression of price earnings ratios against payout beta and growth the coefficient you get on growth is a rough measure how much the market is willing to pay for growth and the best possible combination as I said for a company is to have a low Equity risk premium and a high price for growth because then if you're a risky High Growth Company you get this huge price earnings ratio the worst case scenario is to have a high Equity risk premium and a low price for growth and started 2023 we were closer to the second scenario than the first one risk premiums had risen the price of growth had dropped things have started to modulate back again during the course of this year but those two numbers and numbers towards as a Growth Company so as I said I'm going to just complete the discussion of pricing not a whole lot more to do but by talking about you know the other regressions all right I showed you the PE Ratio regression right you know I started with a scatter plot of price earnings versus growth and then I ran a regression across the market of p e ratios against growth beta and payout ratios I wanted to try the same thing with PEG gracious so again let's start with the scatter plot hey I know this might be my just seeing things but when I did the scatter plot it looked to me in addition to being like a shortcut blast I worried about the linearity and in fact if you have any kind of Statistics package I use SPSS there are linearity tests you can run they're very simple tests and in fact I sent you the link to the statistics class there's one session on regression that I'd encourage you to watch because it tells you how do you tell when there's a non what are the statistics you can use to measure whether it's non-linearity so when I ran those statistics on this it told me it was non-linear now Mr can you share the screen uh thank you thank you for letting me know screenshot you can see it now right yeah yeah perfect thank you so it told me it was non-linear I know they're entire statistics books on what to do when the relationship is non-linear I'll tell you what seems to work in finance almost all of the time and you have a non-linear relationship I took the log of the growth range of the growth rate what's causing the non-linearity here is your growth rate doesn't have that much of a spread but your PE ratio is a huge spread so I took the log of the growth right and so the actual growth rate and a random regression against P ratios just one small change and this scatter plot actually passed linearity test so one way to check to see if you have data that's non-linear is run it through it if it's linear take take one of the variables take the law not the natural log the variable and run the scatter plot when I ran the regression that here's the only difference instead of having the growth rate at the log of the growth right the r squared of the regression is 56.6 the PEG ratio actually did much better than the PE ratio in 2023. it's not always the case the three variables are growth beta and pair but I wanted to take a look at the coefficient of the growth variable remember the original reason analysts created the PEG ratio was they wanted to make growth go away they didn't want to worry about growth look at the coefficient and growth it isn't going away it actually become stronger when you use PEG ratio so those people using Peg ratios have reverse the direction of growth since of growth being a good thing it's become a bad thing for Peg ratios higher growth companies of lower Peg ratios and it's actually become a stronger variable driving Peg ratiers than before so we're going to use Peg ratios at least be open about the fact that you haven't made growth disappear as a variable you've made it a different kind of relationship that you got to factor in when you think about low versus Hyper ratios so the next few pages you know don't expect to see you know it's I really put in there for your project remember one of the pieces of your project you're taking a look at your description is to look at is to price your company against the market I'm going to be a realist I don't expect you to run a market regression because it's messaged a lot of data it takes time to work through the data so you can use my regressions from the start of 2023. and I have these regressions for p e ratios Peg ratios Price to Book ratios EB debit EB to Sales Event invest cap six different multiples you can pick whichever multiple works for you are the regressions by region I've just U.S companies European companies Japanese companies Emerging Market companies which is actually my biggest re you know in terms of number of companies and Australia New Zealand and Canada where because I couldn't figure out where else to put those three and then I have a global regression of all companies in my sample you think which one should I use I'm going to let you make that decision if you have a US company you can use either the US regression or the global regression which ones right you're answering two different questions right because the first one is saying given how are the U.S stocks are priced is my stock underpriced overpriced and the second regression you're asking given how Global stocks are priced is my stock underpriced over price different questions you could potentially get different answers the one thing you would notice about these regressions is I always start with the same it's the same three variables it's not like I'm running regressions from scratch I'm running them at beta growth and payout ratios in every single bit the r squares are all over the place the Japanese stocks at the start of 2023 at the highest r squared I was able to explain the largest percentage of differences in PE ratios with fundamentals that doesn't make it better or worse it just no just a reflection of the year so pick the multiple that you find and as I said I price earnings Peg ratios Price to Book and with every one of them you'll notice that I've specified the variables and the variables you should be able to pull from Capital IQ if you're interested or for your company you can use your forecasted growth rate from your DCF so you have the freedom for your company to specify how you come up with the Roe the growth rate you're not constrained go to Capital IQ and use those variables just plug them into the regression get a predicted pricing for your company basically for each one of them you see the regressions with the r squares and the T statistics any questions on pricing so if you think about it you have lots of choices when it comes to pricing right you can use equity multiples Enterprise Value multiples you can use Revenue to scale our own decision scale R so I'm going to give you a very quick guide to how to pick the multiple that you want to use in your regression so on value you have a choice do you want to go with the Enterprise Value you want to go with Equity value if you're doing a Financial Service Company there is no choice you have to do Equity value so don't do banks with Enterprise Value multiples you will drive yourself crazy with every other sector you have a choice and if you have a sector where leverage varies widely across the sector so take a look at the debt ratios if they're very different across companies you're better off using Enterprise values because PE ratios are going to get skewed by how much leverage you have so whether you use equity value or Enterprise Value is going to be driven by first whether you're doing financial service companies if you're not by how much differences in leverage you have for your scale R you can have revenues you can have earnings you can have cash flows or you can have Book value in making that choice first your choice if you know make sure you you're being consistent if you chose Enterprise Value your scalar has to be an Enterprise Value so we're doing revenues or ebitda you have to use Enterprise Value as your numerator if you're doing earnings you have a choice you can go with either Equity or Enterprise Value depending on how you measure hunts second you might have no choice but to use revenues if most of the companies near Sector are money lose it because you need your scalar to be positive and finally my preference is to work with a number that is not too affected by accounting choices so if you feel your earnings per share net income are driven by too many accounting discretionary choices you want to avoid those numbers because otherwise what you might see is cheap might just reflect accounting choices on in terms of whether you want to use current numbers trailing forward or really really forward it'll depend on your company again if you have a money losing company with not much substance now you have no choice but to move things and look at your five or your debt if you have a company which has substance on all of these which one you use will depend on where the company is it's a mature company or Growth Company and also it's a company with earnings going up and down you might want to use some kind of an average across time rather than the most recent years numbers and finally in terms of comparable firms you know you have to look at when you pick a group like steel or mining how much do they share in common the more they share in common the better off you are if you want to check to see whether your pricing is different across multiples remember this is an empirical question look at the PE ratios look at the market cap and larger companies of lower PE ratios a higher P ratios just running a regression a fee against market cap will tell you that so it's not something you have to decide let the data tell you what to do and you know what no in terms of how big a sample you you need if you want to run a regression you need at least step maybe nine you can get away with if you don't plan to run a regression if you have only four companies you're doing right sharing and you say look I've just left grab and Uber in my you can't run a regression that's okay but then you can settle for a smaller sample but the biggest sample the more power you can get the statistical tests and remember what I suggest if you have 10 companies you can have one independent variable 20 you can have two thirty you can have three so how many variables you can throw in your regression would increase depending on the size of your sap so let's let me conclude the pricing section with a couple of statements that I think are pretty obvious might as well make first is in a pricing you're not telling me whether your company is cheaper expensive you're telling me with a cheaper expensive relative to the group you're comparing it to it's not an absolute statement it's a relative state that's why I used to call pricing relative valuation but I've chosen to go with the pricing word because I think it reflects what you're doing much better then second when you do if when you value US that when you try to price something you're going to have a really tough time finding something exactly like it so no matter how hard you try with your comparable firms there will be differences you can choose to ignore the differences and I'm okay with that but then at least be open about the fact that it's saying I'm ignoring the differences just comparing the average but if there are differences and you can control for those differences your pricing becomes more powerful so pricing is perfectly appropriate way to put a number in an asset but philosophically you're approaching putting that number in a very different way than we did this year any questions at all about pricing any aspect of pricing multiple corpables use what no so I actually think of the world as divided to investors and Traders and I think I've mentioned this trade is price sticks investors value things Traders make money by buying at a low price selling at a high price so if you're a Trader you should be using multiples and comparables even church because you're interested in playing the pricing game yes so let's say you know deciding which regression is um you don't completely ignore it I mean if you have an 85 versus a six percent it's a no-brainer right but it shouldn't dress so if you have let's say DB type and da regression which is a 52 r squared and a Price to Book regression which is 40 and intuitively you feel the price to book regression no it gives you the the one thing is this is a place where bias is going to show up right what makes your life easier to have a pricing that backs up your DCF or a pricing that is Divergent from your DCF that's enough report is nice and clean and tidy I understand that so if you find The Price to Book ties much more closely to your DCF conclusion it makes your report easier to write go for it but remember what you did because when people use pricing on you remember that that bias also kicks in the way people pick multiples but I think it does make sense to pick multiples you can explain more of but and 50 r squared is a forty percent r squared is not different enough to drive that choice there if you pick the 40 R square and say no the other way to think about the multiple you want to pick is think of what people in that sector Management in that sector tend to focus on and you get a sense of what multiple makes the most sense I'll give you an example if you follow retailers every retailer when they report their earnings report there are two numbers retailers tend to kind of obsess about one is same store sales because that tells you how efficiently you're growing the second is margins because that drives it if your focus is on margins guess which multiple makes the most sense put multiple as as margins as its companion variable actually Revenue multiples right earnings goes with growth margins go with Revenue multiples Revenue multiples you're going to see are much more intuitive so when you talk to retailers about Revenue multiples they relay technology companies especially money making ones it's all about growth and they talk about growth in earnings per share P ratios financial service companies big focus on return Equity because the equity is marked up to Market it's got to be regulatory Equity it's constrained Price to Book ratios you tell me what companies in a sector focus on and the multiple kind of falls out of it and you can extend this even to user-based companies what do user-based companies focus on number of users not surprisingly the multiple that seems to explain market cap best is no number of uses per company price per user so tell me what companies manages in a sector focus on the multiple kind of falls out of that Focus okay so let me go through four steps start by defining the multiple check for consistency Equity Equity Enterprise Value Enterprise Value make sure it's uniformly estimated describe the multiple not fancy put up a histogram get the set so what's high what's low the 10th percentile the 90th percentile the 25th percentile the 75th percentile analyze the multiple and and in fact we need to describe the multiple check to see how many companies you lose because there is bias that gets created every time you lose analyze the multiple use a little trick if it's an equity multiple go back to a dividend discount model do the algebra if it's an Enterprise Value multiple go back to an Enterprise Value model do the azure and only then should you apply Define describe analyze apply okay if you do this on two or three multiples you very quickly catch on the first time you do it it'll be like a grind but after you do it two or three times you get a sense of what this is and why it's so critical that you do your homework first before you start applying pricing on your site so let's talk about acid-base valuation let me review intrinsic based intrinsic valuation you valued a company based on its fundamentals its cash flows growth and risk in relative valuation or pricing you put a number on a company based on what other people are paying for similar companies so sometimes so when I tell people there are only two ways you could put a number you know intrinsic valuation or pricing so no no there's a third way how about asset based valuation I'm going to very quickly point out in a few pages why it's not a third way but for some it seems like a third way right you take the assets you value the individual ass to sum them up you get a value for the company you know what they're missing right to put a number on an acid what do I need to do I either need to do intrinsic valuation or I need to price the asset so it's not a different approach it's just an application of an approach you think why would I ever want to put numbers on individual ads there are three scenarios where you would see yourself having to put numbers in us the first is if you're doing a liquidation of a company because in the liquidation of a company you're going to sell off the assets essentially for scrap and you say what is each part worth the second is accounting valuation you know that 65 of all valuations done in the world now are done purely for accounting reasons what drove this was of course a pushing accounting towards fair value accounting so you're walking nerds to Nia or a Deloitte and you go to the valuation section you think the value company is for transactions maybe two out of ten valuations for transactions the bulk of the valuations offer restating numbers and balance sheets because the accounting rules require them to do I'm going to come back and talk about that but that the notion of fair value accounting that I think is an oxymoron and why I think it needs to be renamed but that's a big chunk of what the valuation so any of you end up working in valuation don't be surprised with many of your evaluations are for these accounting purposes and the third reason you might want to Value individual assets is because you want to Value the company as a sum of its parts because you want to do something about it you're a potential acquirer of the company you want to acquire the company and break it up into pots or you're an investor interested in investing in the company because you think eventually any difference will have to go away so let's take each of the you know you know when when you think about it when asset-based valuation is is likely to come into play first let's dispenser the notion that asset-based valuation is somehow a different way of doing valuation because ultimately you got to come up with numbers for the ass and there are three ways you can do it one is to do an intrinsic valuation of each asset get cash flows in the asset present value the second is to price each as in which case you might get the earnings on each asset apply a multiple to it and there's a third way which is you trust your accountants and you use the book value of the asset as your estimate of the value incredibly lazy but a lot of liquidation valuation is based on Book value or you know people prefer to use the word net asset value because it makes more you know sounds like you've done more work than book but it's Book value dressed up so let's look at when asset-based valuation is easiest to do and when it's most difficult to do so you're looking at a company saying should I be doing a space valuation asset-based valuation is easiest to do when you have separable assets you know what I mean by that the company owns Five assets each produces cash flows but there are no interconnections you asked me to do an asset-base valuation of Disney I'm going to refuse on the spot why because if you want to Value the theme parks remember a big part of the value of the theme park comes from how well the movie business is doing and now with streaming how well the movie business is doing feeds into their streaming business if you try to Value Disney in Parts you're going to run into these issues what do I do about these cross business effects because they don't belong in any individual business they come from so the more separable your assets are the easier it is to do asset-based valuation you're a real estate company you own 10 properties Each of which is a rental property asset-based valuation is Trivial right you take each property valid by itself you add them up there's no synergies across there might be some cost savings you get but they're easy to deal with the more separable your assets the easier it is to do evaluation second it's nice of each individual part has its own financial statements so you take a building and each building has a rental Pro no rental income rental expenses and each has a standalone Financial much easier because now you're not trying to guess where do the costs go and finally if you're doing pricing it's nice if you have a market for those individual assets here again you can see why real estate companies it's all pricing all the time because you have individual assets but they're part of this property we could say what is a you know a property in downtown New York go for you look at other you know properties that have sold recently so when you think about when is it easiest to do asset base valuation you need separable assets with financials for each one and if it's nice if you can get other assets like it that are being traded out there so let's take the three scenarios that we talked about and look at how we'd approach coming up with the asset-base valuation let's try on liquidation valuation so let's suppose I come to you with a company with multiple ads and say what is the value of this company in liquidation remember your end game years you're going to sell off each asset see what you can get I think you should be more likely to do a pricing than an intrinsic valuation here because in liquidation valuation it's whatever people will pay you right not what you think it's worth you might even actually have to attach a discount for a liquidity because you're trying to sell something quickly especially if it's a big asset you might not get what you think is a fair pricing but liquidation valuation again you're trying to get a sense of what would I get in the market today if I sold those assets that's a pricing mission so liquidation valuation I don't think we should ever be doing discounted cash flow valuation unless you're curious what's the point but let's talk about accounting valuation call Fair Value accounting right when when an accounting professor use the word fair value accounting I want you to put them on the spot and ask them where's the value in Fair Value accounting okay I mean and and to see that let's actually step up I remember when they were writing the fair value accounting rules one of the things you know the panel was dealing with was hey what valuation approach do we use so I remember reading the description the fact I think it's fast 157 was the the original you know rule that described what fair value accounting's mission was going to be and they talked a great deal about what a market participant would pay for an asset in an arms length transaction let me repeat that again they wanted to put numbers and assets that a market participant will pay in an arm's length transaction that sounds to me like a pricing mission right what a market participant would pay and then they dig deeper in fact you know you keep reading it the more you read it the more you realize that what they want you to do is attach what you would get in the market today if you try to sell this ass in fact they make a big deal about exit value versus entry value which I think is a contrast between a bid and an Ask price but basically a pricing but here's the problem if you look at how accountants are required to back up that pricing that they put on each app so you know what they're required to do they're required to do a discounted cash flow evaluation one of the most wasteful exercises I've seen in valuation practice I just remember about eight seven eight years ago I get a Call of Fairly frantic call from the account I forget which which account and accounting firm it was that was called in by Fidelity to put a fair value on their Uber holding remember this was before Uber in public but it already had the quietest position in Uber and because accounting requires that you you know Mark to Market they had to call in the accountants to Mark to Market this holding so the call starts out with we have a problem and I said what's your problem so we're using a discounted cash flow model and we're getting only 200 million and I said why hold what does he only mean there he said we should be getting about 2 billion and so if you already know what you should be getting why are you wasting your time going through this discounted cash flow valuation and you know why how they came up with the two billion this was right after the Saudi the Saudi Investment fund an investment Uber at a 65 billion dollar value pricing not valuation and they knew that Fidelity shared based on that pricing should be roughly 2 billion but they were getting only 200 million they said what should we do we've tried everything and I said you can take the DC app and if we play enough with it you can end up at 2 billion right use a higher growth rate increase the margin lower the discount rate we know all the tricks to play you're going to have to hide it under different layers of uh verbosity but basically but you can already see it's pointless right it's a kabuki dance you know you need to get a 2 billion the DCF becomes a vehicle to get to 2 billion you know what I would do if I were the accounting rule writers I would say don't use DCFS this is a pricing mission tell me it'll be wouldn't it be much more honest if if you were told that fidelius is repriced it's Uber hold it's 2 billion based on the Saudi Investment funds most recent pricing rather than tell you we've done an intrinsic valuation of this Uber holding and it's worth two billion accounting fair value I think should be called accounting fair price so first thing is I would remove the fair value make it fair price and allow people to back it up with just multiples and comparables do not use discounted cash flow models because this is not a valuation the only promise that'll mean 90 of your work is gone how do you charge all these do they don't they charge by the hour or no is it so you can run these DCF models as much as you want but you're searching for something that you cannot find any questions on on Fair Value accounting so I think the problem is there's a mission split what accounting rule writers claim they want you to do is at odds with the rules they've written about what they would like you to show and that's creating an incredible amount of confusion in this process so let's talk yes go ahead so allergies how would you account for like um valuation is not an issue liquidation what are you going to do you're going to get the best you can right so what what is valuation even come into play if this company or the valuable companies are going concerned wouldn't be liquidating in the first place that gave me truncated that's why when you do discounted cash flow evaluation we put in that failure because once you fail nobody's paying your present value of future growth in the year 20 and terminal value and as Nirvana they're going to pay you what on based on what you have in front of you so once you're enter liquidation but that's an entirely pricing based thing and that's why when you put in a failure rate ask you what percentage of your book value will you get back something to tell me what in liquidation value going to be worth and that liquidation value could be zero sub companies yeah foreign so let's talk about some of the parts valuation in theory some of the parts valuation you take each part you come up with a number for it you add them all up you come up with a value for the company there are leakages in this process that we've got to deal with and we'll talk about what those leakages are but it's often far easier to do an intrinsic some of the Parts pricing than some of the parts valuation and again if you think about who might be interested in some of the parts valuation you might be one of those long-term patient investors who buys companies that trade at less than the sum of the parts not because you plan to break it up but you think eventually over time this reality will catch up and market prices should rise to the sum of the parts or you can be somebody who wants to be an activist who wants to take over the company buy the company for whatever the prevailing prices and sell off the parts that presumably valued reasonably well and come up with a number higher than you paid so I'm going to start I'm going to take the United Technology I'll tell you why I picked United Technologies first this is not like Disney where you got spillover effects so these are very different businesses these are the businesses they're in they're in refrigeration systems defense construction security no manufacturing and aircraft six different businesses side note and they were one of the few companies that actually gives you full information on each business so this came right out of the financials I didn't have to dig very deep they give you revenues operating income capex depreciation in other words it's almost like each of these businesses is treated like a standalone business it's very unusual to have this much detail by business so here's my first track I'm going to do a sum of the Parts pricing but I'm going to do the back of the envelope version here's what I I'm going to take the ebitda that they gave me for each of the companies so they're my if it does I'm going to take an EBT for the sector that each of these companies operates so I find publicly traded companies in each one and I'm going to multiply it by the EV to EB debit that come up with the Enterprise rents and add them on the value that I got for the operating businesses was 61.7 there this is what most analysts mean when they do when they say they've done some of the parts valuations they've taken the Epitaph revenues or earnings or some common metric applied a multiple an average for the sector and add them up play Devil's Advocate what what am I going to miss when I do this what am I assuming about each of United Technologies businesses then when I use the average for the sector one of them is a higher growth than the rest I'm missing that every the standard problem of applying an average what else am I missing I'm taking the habit of each of the six it's good if they were integrated then I'll be so I don't want integration right so so when you say they're not integrated what exactly are we are we talking about tell me why though it's got to shop somewhere so what number would it show up in but where would that ever does show up because remember the sum of this advertised the habitat for the company right so if it's showing up somewhere so if that's happening it's not that it's disappearing it's actually slipping into so if there's cross business then what's happening is the ebitda for one business is being moved to the end of another I'm applying the wrong multiple because my refrigeration systems is selling to my foreign Securities so it's not disappearing it's just in there but in the wrong place that's the problem and I do a couple like Disney right the theme park habitat is might be 20 because my movie business was doing so well not so much of an issue here what shows up below every day you might have other expenses which might be corporate expenses and if it doesn't show up in scnn shows up below it's possible there might be some corporate expenses that are there that I'm completely acting like you know what I'm taking a very cynical view which is tomorrow these companies broke up that corporate GNA can go in nothing gets affected and civically you can say well that's always the case but you can only that that that sometimes when you centralize things that removing it will cause cost to revert back to these companies I think if you just do a pricing based on stated of the businesses you often always State the pricing of the company because those common costs then somehow get ignored almost we'll talk about what to do when we do an intrinsic valuation is there a way I could fix the problem though of these businesses not being like the average business what do we do with traditional pricing to bring in the differences across companies we did a regression right it's a lot of work you're saying you're right you have to have six regressions I did I actually ran more than six regressions I ran now I tried three different multiples I stayed with Enterprise Value because I want to go to equity value at a business level because who knows what the debt is I did say with Enterprise I did Enterprise Value sales Enterprise Value Enterprise Value invest Capital Iran all three regressions for each of the six businesses and here I was agnostic about which one to pick I didn't have a strong preference I picked the one which had the highest r squared in each one you know what I'm going to do now right I'm going to plug in the numbers for for United Technologies refrigeration systems tax rate and return capital and I'm going to go about the predicted multiple Enterprise value for each of these businesses based upon these regressions at least I've taken care of one of the problems I'm no longer assuming these businesses are just like the average I'm allowing for differences the value that I got was 74.23 billion so there's my regression number predict so it's so the only difference between what I'm doing here and what I did before is there every every business I use a EB debit down here I could use different multiples for different businesses depending on which business I'm in and I come so I've added about eight billion dollars to My overall value what does that mean the typical United Technologies business actually is a little better than the average company in that sector for whatever reason and this higher value higher pricing reflects that their Superior growth of lower risk or something else that's making them priced higher but I'm still pricing is with regard so about 66 billion back up the envelope 74 billion with these kind of finesse regressions but I really wanted to do a true entrance evaluation go to a need for a true intrinsic valuation everything I need for any intrinsic valuation right I need cash flows and growth and risk so here's what I started with I started by estimating a cost to capital for each of the six businesses remember how we got bottom-up Pages no we took instead of taking a weighted average I'm actually letting each one play out as a different cost of capital for each business so you'll notice that my debt to equity ratio is the same because United Technologies did borrow as a company and I didn't feel any of these businesses were off the map in terms of how much debt they should have they're all required manufacturing so I put them all in with the same debt to equity but if you wanted to you could actually change that to equity ratios have each business carry a different debt to equity as long as there's some of the debt across the businesses adds up to the sum of the debt of the company so I've computed debt to equity ratio in 11 beta different costs of equity they have fired security business is the safest the riskiest business is their helicopter business Sikorsky but I gave them all the same cost debt for the same reasons I gave them the same debt ratio the company is borrowing for all six businesses I use the rating for the company in the cost per but the bottom line is that six different costs of capital why because I'm going to Value each one separately I have a cost to capital for each one you can already see that if you're doing this for Coca-Cola geographically debate is going to be the same the unleavened beta and the Levitt beta but what's going to be different is the equity risk premium used for Asia will reflect the weighted average Erp for Asia so you're going to end up with very different cost of calculation now to get the numbers for the growth rate I'm going to go to the shortcut remember margins are stable I can use the return on Capital times the reinvestment rate I completed the returns and capital for the six businesses notice the the outlier the Fire and Security business which is the least Risky Business also has the lowest return in capital and at the reinvestment so at the return on Capital the reinvestment rate for each business at the cost to Capital each business at the fundamentals I need to drive the value of the company in there I plug them in and in fact because I'm valuing each business separately I can make my own judgments some are high growth some are already mature I didn't have to put one size fits all and you can see that I've actually assumed the foreign security business is a mature business with zero years of high growth the other were all moderately high growth none are high enough but if United Technology had a gaming business or an AI business I can add that on right very different cost of capital I might have a 10-year growth period I would have negative margin in essence I'm doing what you did for one company I can do for each of the businesses separately different Revenue growth different margins different reinvestment and different cost of capital here's the bottom line though and I do my intrinsic valuation for these businesses the value that I come up with if I do the entrance evaluation of each of the businesses is 80.25 billion dollars that's valuing each business separately that's higher than either of the pricings but that's neither here nor there this is an intrinsic valuation of each of the six businesses and here I want to tie up that loose end and the loose end was that United Technology is a 408 million dollars in corporate expenses that were unallocated you know what that means right all my free cash flows are before these expenses so these four and eight million dollars in expenses are still there I decided to take the non-cynical view that these four and eight million dollars were providing services that cut across the six businesses they were not going to go away next year so I took the present value of those savings over time so this is the present value of a growing perpetuity I'm assuming these costs will continue to you know for the company over over in perpetuity the present value of those corporate expenses is 4.587 billion so I take the 80.3 billion that I got for the six businesses I subtract up you see why I subtracted out these expenses are going to drain value they're just Collective expenses the value that I get as the sum of the parts DCF is 75.7 billion I actually um when I did the pricing got 74.2 I actually did a full-fledged PCF of the company overall it's a Consolidated valuation I got 71.5 billion and part of the reason was then I had to make one assumption about growth periods and it forces all of these businesses into one grouping so the range of value is actually out outside of the the actual market price was 52.2 billion so if you looked at the actual traded value is lower than any of these numbers but there's significantly more undervalued using an intrinsic valuation some of the parts that were needed pricing yes I prefer the word equation rather than formula because formula yeah remember the regressions all you need is uniform so if you decide to go effective go effective for all of the companies we decide to go marginal go margin with all of the companies and yours right the profit marginal is if you pick companies within the same Market marginal tax rate is the marginal tax rate right it's going to be the same so if you believe there are tax differences across companies and effective tax rate is probably going to capture that better than marginal tax rates so given a choice I'd probably go with effective tax rates but if you decide to go marginally companies in multiple countries you worry about marginal tax rates driving how they're being priced then you can use the marginal tax rates but then use that for your company as well the simple rule is whatever you use any regression use for your company as well use the same definition so use return invested Capital you do the return invest capital for your company as well yes so if I wanted to proudly they suppose that this company is digesting one of the businesses really distract allocates some of the corporate expenses you should right because otherwise in fact that's a very good point often it the best just you'd see people taking the financials that they gave you for that subsidiary value get so that's how much I'd pay but then after you buy the company you know what you're going to discover they don't have an accounting department so how do you get away with that well corporate took care of that you don't have an inventory or why so what you're going to wake up to our unpleasant surprises afterwards so I think you you have to do that right you have to take the corporate expenses and decide what portion of that was due to this Division if they won't give you the information based on revenues allocate it like accountants word and said that portion is going to go there otherwise it won't overvalue the company that's the other thing I could have done is I could I could have taken the 408 million I knew the revenues and have been down for each business that allocated across the six businesses and reduce the habitat for each business that way it's not a separate item now here I just took it as a consolid and used the company's costing Capital Discount yes yeah and uh so the corporate expenses just come from like the Consolidated income statement it comes to the fact that the headquarters usually these companies United Technologies the headquarters headquarters some functions are centralized I give you the example of accounting accounting tends to be centralized because they prefer to run it out of headquarters so so that becomes the essentially that becomes a cost that headquarters building everybody who lives who stays there you know G's headquarters were what Connecticut huge space but nothing that GE actually did came out of that space but think of all those expenses of maintaining the space all the people who work there presumably all of ge's businesses gain from the people working there but that's what that DNA is that centralized cost where every business benefits from it but they centralize it because they thought they got economies of scale they did it for the best of intention they weren't doing it to make evaluation more difficult I'm just bringing it in separately so I want you to think about if you were trying to do this for a Coca-Cola how much what the challenges would be and the next time somebody casually says Sony's trading at less than the sum of its spots push them on it right think of how I mean this is the easiest of the sum of the parts valuation it's six very different businesses think of Sony's business and ask yourself how am I going to draw the lines on separable businesses how am I going to get the information and how is it that so that you can so casually decide that something is trading at less than some of the spots I think for every 10 times I hear about companies trading less than some of the part some of the parts maybe one out of the ten is true the other nine I'm skeptical you just think it's on the company's undervalued uses some of the parts as a neat little excuse for doing it but it's not as if you've done a series of the parts valuation to make that judgment why might a business trade less than the sum of its parts but shouldn't that be in the numbers already but I'm asking about some of the parts valuation so pricing can be all over the re already yeah Philip Morris used to own craft Foods this they spun off crab Foods because they felt that there was a contamination effect you know the contamination effect you're worried about right tobacco companies were being sued they said my intrinsic value of Kraft Foods is actually being reduced because I worry about the spillover effect of cigarette lawsuits affect what I do at craft so one is if you have a company that has acquired a poisonous reputation and you worry about that affecting the numbers you might argue that removing that company from the businesses could potentially give you much higher values for the businesses right so it could be that it could be taxes maybe you're being taxed more you know it can cut both ways but maybe you're paying a higher effective tax rate as this Consolidated company but if you broke it off into individual Parts this used to be for U.S companies with subsidiaries outside the US where the old U.S tax law required that all the income be taxed the U.S tax rate there was actually an incentive for these businesses to spin off therefore it subsidiaries and let them stand alone because overnight the taxes dropped yes sir [Music] foreign well in a sense it's breaking it up into Parts essentially gives you a legal benefit right because then you're arguing that they can't come out especially if that subsidiary is a small not that valuable subsidiary and you have a really valuable parent company the only thing is the lawyers are not going to sit there and let you do this right so they're going to go to court and say this is a tactic to so it's not as easy as it's not bear actually had to pay a substantial settlement to get away from the Monsanto lawsuits but no I'm sure legal issues can push you towards breaking up if it means protection I think Johnson and Johnson was also created subsidiary for their for for portions of their legally targeted businesses yes so I don't for a second think Amazon is what do you think you know if AWS is really not the would you want to take Amazon Prime I don't see how AWS is hurt by the rest of Amazon's businesses right so unless you could show me some kind of Anti-Trust thing that's now going to be imposed on AWS because people don't like Amazon I'm not sure there's that much of a gate well it's it it allows them to set for lower margins and other it's a cash cow right and to the extent that it's a cash card allows them to take risks in their other businesses that otherwise couldn't have taken right so you could argue that the growth of Amazon Prime was made possible by the last seven or eight years of cloud cash flows so I could give you just as good a story about how this is increasing the value of Amazon collectively by having a cash cow in the middle no but I think that if you spend AWS it's not just another Cloud company it's not going to be the greatest company in the face of the Earth and Amazon is going to keep going I mean and I know that Scott is big on breaking up the big tech companies you want to break up Facebook into Facebook I mean those companies will be worthless as their part that if they break them into parts right because it's the ecosystem that makes the networking benefit so higher so you take Instagram you separate it from Facebook and you take Facebook and separate from WhatsApp as Standalone businesses they're definitely going to be worthless so there the objective is not to increase values to make them less powerful maybe you know that's God's point but it will make them less valuable as as collective business yes you'd have to give it so it would show up in for our Foods margins and what they can do maybe their growth is being constrained because they're part of Philip Morris when they try to grow in a country country says look here tobacco subsidiary we're not going to allow you to grow so maybe value them twice once without the constraints imposed by being part of Philip Morris and one with the constraints and the difference every Green energy business that's part of a fossil fuel company faces this problem right they compete against a standalone green Energy company they might be at a disadvantage in winning that betting War because people say you're an Exxon Mobil subsidiary and you're competing in this you know Korean Energy company standing alone that's why I think traditional companies in the fossil fuel space have so much difficulty getting their green energy business off the ground is that contamination effect can affect them and how quickly they grow and how they attract employees and everything else it goes with yes you could right because once you that's actually a good point Alibaba is breaking up into its considering Parts what do you think the reason there is 2019 of course Alibaba was I mean the Chinese government was viewed as an ally for Alibaba until 2019 right that things seemed to change and all of a sudden the Chinese government decided they're going to take a harder line with their biggest tech companies Alibaba Ted said JD and ever since Alibaba has been under a dark cloud it's almost like Alibaba is throwing the it's saying look you know we break up into six smaller companies maybe we'd be less scary as six separate companies and you can now attract different investors maybe alipay will attract a different investor base that might not have been so that's a pricing argument it's a demand Supply argument or push up the pricing but I think that from a pricing perspective sometimes breaking a Consolidated company into its individual groups might allow you to track different kinds of investors for different groups and essentially push up the pricing so but we have to separate the valuation arguments of the pricing arguments and see which one's driving this particular part of the process yeah but that that's got to be a really strong remember any cost to Capital argument I'm going to push back on right because cost of capital are very difficult to move by just breaking up and getting Less in a different Market but there you could make it an intrinsic value argument if you can convince me that by breaking up into individual pieces you're able to have usually it cuts the other way right I gave all of United Technologies businesses the same cost of debt my guess is their individual businesses some of them face higher costs of debt but if you can show me that the cost of capital will be lower you could make an intrinsic value argument and I hate the I'm sorry about the colors I wish I'd use something a little more this is actually G about four years ago this is all it was already a Walking Dead company and I want to use it to illustrate one very simple point one is I'm glad I did not do this G in 2006. there have been 26 rows and there's 26 different businesses this G after that slimmed down you can call it that look at the business it's in you're saying why are they Shader one of the nice things about breaking a company down by business is remember our test of return on Capital being higher than the cost of capital we did that at a company-wide level but now I can do it by best so when I looked at GN as I said if this was five years ago the three businesses where they earned above their cost of capital were Aviation Healthcare and transportation listen think of this as a three potentially good businesses the three that where they roughly earned their cost of capital are yellow and then there are two awful businesses G lighting I you know I use G but I don't know what happened to that business but it looks terrible from a return cap basis and GE Capital it's just a disaster waiting to happen in fact when I value the six businesses I value GE Capital 27.08 value but remember that's a value of the business the debt that GE Capital carried was 51 billion 27 billion minus 51 billion it's mine one business has a value of minus 24 billion dollars in one day to shut it down obviously people are not going to pay for it the Brahma g capital is entangled everywhere GE Capital actually backs up many of the ga Aviation sales that they do to their customers is backed up by GE Capital G's problem has always been because g capital is so entangled and this was Jack Welch's worst Legacy is by bringing in GE Capital and entangling in all the other businesses it's almost impossible to do it through some of the parts where you separate the parts because five years ago I think everybody accepted that she should probably be broken up the only question is how do you break up a company we have g capital kind of holding these businesses together and what do you do about GE Capital yeah this conversation will come down to 1000 view on how well internal the capital markets function and your your answer is this in that if you can face off that's a good point because any time I mean I'll take the an example from India which has troubled a lot of people Reliance is one of India's largest market cap companies and over the last decade Reliance has invested billions of dollars in Reliance geo geo is a telecom business and GEOS business model if you look at it is basically giveaway Telecom services for nothing I think every.com every you know online company that has gone public in the last five ten years in India should give a third of their value to Reliance Geo because Reliance has essentially made Broadband accessible to hundreds of millions of each but it's a cash drain and you have zero power over how money gets moved around Reliance and people seem to be okay with it because the distrust of if vocation bani is not a dumb guy he's he's I'm sure he's thinking about the right things when he does this but I think the minute that trust fails you're going to get a very different perspective you're right for the moment I think Amazon but remember Jeff Bezos is no longer there it's now Andy Jackson's company I don't think he has as much of a leash as Bezos did so already you can see people saying things about Amazon that they weren't talking about two or three years ago they told me how Amazon has led its online retail business kind of get you know they've been distracted so I've seen things said about Amazon that suggest me that the trust is freeing and once it frays enough you could potentially see people arguing we don't want you know AWS to be part of Amazon because we no longer trust Amazon's management to do the right thing it's it's a point that Facebook has reached right three years ago five years ago Facebook had done what they did they probably could have gotten away with it now people have lost trust in Zuckerberg so when he says trust me I know what I'm doing in the metabolism I'm going to spend 100 billion so why should we so I think it is true trust is a big factor when you have these internal Capital markets and when Jack Welch ranji there was Supreme press greatest CEO on the face of the Earth you can do whatever he wants and I mean that's exactly right yeah and this is the reason I think when you have the corporate governance matters even when you think management is good you need people pushing back saying what's the downside here and nobody pushed back because he was he was he was a complete ruler by the time he got to the end of his Stadium or even by the middle of snake at least let's please get the process started on value private businesses first I mean let's be very clear valuing a private business a valuable business is driven by cash flows growth and risk if that sounds familiar that's because private business and public businesses it's the same rule that said though there are two things you're going to run into with private businesses that would potentially make your life a little more difficult the first is there is no market value you think so what it's only when you value private businesses you realize how much you rely on market value when you value public company so I'm going to talk about where you will miss it and what you might need to do to make effort the second is I mean if you are worried about accounting differences across public companies you should see the accounting differences across private businesses especially small private businesses so let's take those two factors and look at why they become an issue evaluation push you know what I mean by no market value right the publicly traded company it's a market price out there and there are three levels at which you miss market prices first is there are Market values that you use as inputs into your DCF valuation like where when you do your cost to Capital your weights on debt and Equity are Market values you don't have that when you think about uh you know when you think about value options that your company's done what do you use use the market price for sure so that's the first place you're going to miss them is in those input numbers the second is a little more subtle I wanted to think about the moment you finish the valuation of your company think of the first number you checked after you finished evaluation you check the market price right the market value is very different from the market price what did you do who went back and you looked at the numbers again and I'm leaving it at that maybe you did more than look at the numbers there's a feedback effect right because if you get a three dollar value per share the market price is 300 this isn't a supremely overvalued company probably got the units wrong are you it's it's amazing how much feedback you get from the market price that goes back into evaluation you don't have that with the private company you could get three dollars for the real value is three thousand your units are up you have no way of even knowing until it's too late and finally if you would think about the traditional ways you estimate risk how do we get a beta we run a regression or what stock prices against the index you don't have that with private companies so that's the first thing to get used to is there is no market price crutch to fall back on and in terms of estimating cash flows it's true you start with the financials you go through the same process but many private businesses you have a much shorter history to work with second as I said Accounting Standards can be all over the place if you have private companies of reasonable sets if you go walk into uh you know Coke Industries you know you're going to get something that looks very much like public companies but you walk into a small retail business that's owned by the person behind the counter the county can be all over the place I still remember somebody in you know this class about 10 years ago decided to Value the flowers of them their mother's flower shop because she wanted evaluation and you know she said I'd like to value my mother's flower shop I said be my guest but four weeks later she showed up in my office I need to change companies what happened we have a fight with your mom or something she said I went and asked my mom for the financials and she led me into a small back room and the walls were all covered with Post-it notes and you know she said this is my Revenue wall and she had different colored Post-It note the red Post-it notes it's my expense wall every time I'm an expensive writing a Post-It note I don't think Post-It note accounting is under IFRS or gab but you could see why she had to do that right she had a she had a store to run with the time to sit around doing accounting statements at the end of the year presumably she could put off all these Post-it notes and took it to an accountant to pull the numbers together but especially with small Private Business the accounting could be all over the place the third is with private this is true in every business with private businesses there's line between the personal and the business becomes a hazy one right there's a company car but at 3 30 in the afternoon seems to disappear for about 45 minutes so the kids get out of school it picks you know I mean it's it's it you know you're on a personal business you know even though you might never tell the IRS this there are these lines that get crossed I call this that and there are people who are you know who sometimes are shown as employees for a private business so what do they do and I don't know they have the same last name as the owner I call this the George Costanza effect in all my years of watching Seinfeld never quite figured out what George did for the Yankees I think there's one episode where he changed their uniforms to polyester it did not end well but most of the residents what exactly is the assistant to the equipment manager whatever his diet was what do they do a lot of assistance the equipment management private businesses adventure and finally and this is a big deal in something to think about it is many private businesses the owner doesn't pay himself for herself a Saturday what's the point anyway you get whatever's left over you think who cares but they do their financials they do it without showing that salary you see what this is going to do right the income you're going to see for private businesses if you buy this business based on that income guess what you're going to wake up to the next day you walk in say who's doing the accounting huh just walked away who does the floors you know the owner does the floors before she leaves in the evening you now have to replace all of those people and it's going to cost you money I'm going to talk about how this has to be factored in to valuation so let's start with a statement about private company valuation motive matters what does that mean now I'm going to show you and a couple of valuations but I remember about 25 years ago you know the owner of a candy company Works in into my office which is I'd like a valuation for my candy company as if I'm sitting there what you know but she's all very persistent and I said why she said what do you mean why I said why do you want to Value you and I gave you the reasons are you curious it could be just you know because you own a business you want to see what it's worth is it because you're getting divorced and your spouse is going to get half of this business in which case the valuation you want is probably zero okay is it because you have a transaction she thought about it for a moment I want to sell the business I said to whom she said you have a lot of questions I said I need to know she said what do you mean to whom are you selling it to a publicly traded candy company you're selling it to a private Equity investor are you selling it an individual and she thought about it for a moment she said it's an individual I said can you tell me more about the individual is it a wealthy individual who's buying this as a hobby or is it and you're going to see why all these because in the public company you never ask these questions right you value a company you just come up with a value valuations of private companies are much more specific to the company of value at the time you're valuing in the mode that's being used which means that private company appraisers you're going to have a much more difficult time replacing them with AI if they do their job right then public company evaluations motive matters because if your valuation is a show valuation which is curiosity as opposed to transaction valuation I can come up with very different numbers so what I'd like to do is actually talk about four scenarios in private company valuation I'll start with the most difficult one a private to private transaction an individual selling to another individual used to be very common lots of different professions right you're a doctor in the US until about 20 years ago you built up a practice you got to the age of 65 or 70. you know what you did he sold your practice to another doctor you're saying what's happened in the last 25 years it's become corporatized your business but those days you just dentists you saw the practice are plumber who built a business you sold the business you a private to private transaction most difficult scenario in private company valuation the second is a private to public and I'm going to argue things got a lot easier what's a private public you have a private business but you're selling it to a public company this candy business being sold to to a publicly traded candy company to Hershey's very different set of circumstances you made my job a lot easier and you're going to see why you can have a private to IPO you're a private business you're actually getting a valuation because you want to go public we'll talk about the issues that come up a new value company for a public offering and finally you have the three-step process of your private business you're valuing your business because a venture capital is interested in investing in your company and then that venture capitalist plans to take you public we'll see how the process plays out over time so let's start with the private to private transactions and talk a little bit about the challenges in value private to private businesses push when you have an individual selling a business to another individual let's start by being very open about the fact that it's very unlikely that either of those individuals is Diversified you see why this matters right all of our calculations so far when we did cost of equity cost of capital built on the premise the marginal investors Diversified therefore the old leaders they care about is the risk you cannot diversify away this kind of removes the entire foundation so using Baylor right because bait is built on the premise that the marginal investors Diversified that's unlikely to be second if you're buying a private business a farm a plumbing business you change your mind and I'm going to call you so people talk about a liquidity discounts I think of it as the cost of buyers remorse have you ever met buyers from Russia you're listening to Jim Cramer in a moment of weakness you actually do what He suggests right he says buy no Silicon Valley Bank hit the Buy and they said minute second lady so what the heck did I do this guy screamed out like 50 companies every 20 minutes and there what's the cost of buyers remorse you reverse the transaction you paid what if you're in I'm on Schwab it's 5.95 each way that's about 12 and there's a bid ask spread that I pick but that's the cost of buyers for most of the public company it can be tiny if I'm looking at a company like apple it can be much bigger if I'm looking at a likely traded stock because the spread is wider but think of buying a farm or a plumbing business in a moment of weakness you're tired it's the end of the day you're on your way home you take your entire savings you buy a plumbing business you get home and you tell your spouse what you did she said what the heck did you do go sell it think of how much more difficult it is to reverse right so you know what you have to do when you value private business you have to build in that expected cost of buyers remorse at the start of the process Scott applying in a liquidated discount something you don't ever think about with public companies but you have to be private businesses and finally with private businesses there is this issue of a key person value we want the plumbing business great income statement right you buy it based on the income statement in fact I'll make this even more specific my my kids all had to go to the get their get braces this is an incredibly lucrative business no my dentist whose first name is Howie you got rich just based on my kids I think and every time he'd come in I'd wait for my kids Graces to be tightened this is like a weekly or a monthly thing you've got to go in and every time you take the opportunity ask me questions about investing in valuation so go in one time and he says you know while the brakes are being tightened can I ask you a question I said sure he said I'm thinking of retired I said look like 40 years old he said your kids have made me Rich already I'm okay everything every time thinking of selling my business he says I've made a lot of money last time I know I have my credit card shows that already he said but I have a problem and the people who are you know that I'm talking to about buying the business don't seem willing to pay based on that income you can see why right you buy this guy's business how he's business you install yourself as the dentist I come in with my kids and so who the hell are you so I'm your new dentist I said no you're not and I walk out that's a key person discount essentially the expectation that the person running the business walks out there goes 20 30 40 50 of the revenues so we're going to talk about what that discount is and how you as the owner of a business can reduce the discount in fact while we're on it how do you reduce that discount you know what what do you think I told how he turned he said I'm then knocking off 30 or 40 percent basically that's what I said look sell the business but stay on for two years put up a nice you know comfortable easy chair sit there when when somebody comes into the patients walk the patient over to the new dentist you know this is the new dentist and often you'd see this overlaps between an old player a doctor a dentist and then and they're not doing it because they want to stare out there it's because that ease is the key person discount and allows that discount to become more it might still be there but it's a much smaller discount so next session what I'm going to do is I'm going to take an example of a private to private transaction and look at how these play out and I'll be quite honest this part of valuation with this is there's the most touch that we're going to do because there's no precise answer but at least we could think of a way of reasoning our way to the diversification effect the liquidity is kind of the key person okay thank you so um 
foreign okay time we're ready to start so oh a couple of a couple of you know reminders in case you need it I keep saying it just in case we forgot the last one that I gave you the quizzes a week from today the review session's already up there I will set up office and office hour timing on Sunday in the case of questions related to the quiz so it would be assume stress and obviously because you'll be at home I'll be at home so one way or the other so Wednesday plus 30 minutes requests covers packages which will be you know through there's a little bit left today that I'll do but basically if I do so you after today's class you have a week after the material that I mostly do on Monday will not really be on the quiz but through everything so let's talk about valuing private companies and if you remember I started the discussion with this issuer with publicly traded companies we make this assumption perhaps Cavalier leads the marginal investors diversify you think why why does it matter what what is it a biased when you it's your investors Diversified yes it's not that there's no underbusted populist but they don't care about it because in their portfolios it goes away so I can focus just on the risk you cannot diversify away which is basically what beta measures so the minute you use beta so do you like it or not you're assuming marginal investors and as a foundation I said if you have a private to private transaction but a private seller and a private buyer that's almost never going to be true why partly because of constraints right you start a business whereas every dollar of your money going it's going into the business maybe later in your life and you get really wealthy you can start splitting away but even Bill Gates at the peak of his glory at almost a hundred percent of his wealth tied up in Microsoft Microsoft the difference was it was a public company so the marginal investment there could be some institutional investment but it's a private business you got antiversified buyers and undiversified sales we're going to talk about what to do mechanically about it but I want to get a sense of intuition you have two companies they look exactly the same same business same kind of characteristics but one is privately owned and the other is publicly traded which one would you expect to have the higher cost of equity and what lead me through the intuition behind which one will have the higher cost of equity and more and what do you think the private will have a higher one and give me the intuition will be versified um and diversified on non-systematic risk right so that risk will be away from the cost of equity property because we're not provide for companies so anytime people start listing out every risk in a company the public company I'm going to say stop I don't care that Styles change I don't care if that happens because I can diversify it away as an investor I don't have that luxury when I have all my wealth tied up in the business So today we're going to see that private company cost of equities are going to be significantly higher than public company how much it depends on the business you're in right some businesses most of your risk might be might be Market related in the banking business for instance 80 of the risk comes from macroeconomic Market factors you run a private bank your cost of equity is going to be higher but not as high as before a private owner of a restaurant we have all kinds of risk I mean imagine if I start to build in risk for location it's a restaurant it's a big deal right you build a restaurant whatever Highway takes people away with a publicly traded restaurant company I don't do that because I assume it can get Diversified away with the private company it's going to come but to show you even within private companies maybe distinctions and I was talking this morning my corporate finance class about how I have this Mission or a mission is probably too strong award I have to talk to the medicine about three weeks about to the Mets management it's part of a you know series of talks I'm giving 0.72. you know what binds Point 72 in the men's together they're both owned by state code so it's a so 0.72 is in Hudson yards so the Mets man and I've been yesterday afternoon I was working on a corporate finance presentation for the Mets it's it's a fascinating application of corporate finance principles and I was trying to come up with a hurdle rate for the match plus I'm going to do it in U.S dollar times that's the last thing I want to fight on is converted to a currency so I'm going to start at the risk period that's going to be easy premium am I going to use I think pretty interesting the price risk they said so the number I'm stuck on is what do I use to come up with a cost effective now of course you can say it's privately owned but the person who owns it is Steve gone is that the only thing in his portfolio it's what about 15 to 20 billion so Steve Cohen in fact is closer to a diversified investor than an undiversified investor I'm going to say lots of nice things about the Yankees and not so nice things about the Mets but in this one I'm going to argue the defensive and advantage over the Yankees who owns the Yankees it's time better fan right how much of the weapons in the Yankees pretty much all of you did this so if you think about decision making if you have only 10 of 15 of the wealth in a business like Steve Cohen is you can afford to take kind of hit go for a big Data Business I don't think he does I think it's a very expensive talk to be quite honest and he doesn't run it like a business he runs it as a this is my passion I'm a Mets fan all my life I now have the money to own kids would any of you buy the your favorite sports team if you had the money absolutely right Manchester United fan wouldn't you love to be the owner of Manchester United not only can you go into every game you're the star of the show everybody else kind of hangs out around you there's a reason why with sports teams it's all about pricing I think I can't think of a single professional sports franchise where the people running it think of it as a business they're being pushed up let me take the NFL the Pittsburgh Steelers are owned by the Rooney family one of the old time owners who's run it as a business they're the outliers with the Redskins are up for sale you see the prices that people are offering for the this is not a national franchise in the sense the Dallas Cowboys are but I think the numbers being banded around is six to seven billion you know collectively how much ebitda all of the MLB teams made last year put all together all 30 teams less than 600 million half of them lose money this is on an avatar basis the the team with the highest ever done I was shocked when I saw this among the MLB I don't know if you're not Baseball fans it's completely going over your head anybody want to guess which team is the highest debit uh the Seattle Mariners the Oakland A's of City prom I mean in a sense a problem for Oakland for Oakland A's is it in a media Market where they've essentially lost the fight it's because San Francisco Giants own that market it might be the same media market so it's not going to be the Oakland A's but very much longer it could be the Las Vegas days for all we know but that's only a matter of time because it's Seattle Mariners the Yankees have the highest revenues of any mammal beating but they lose money why because the player contracts are larger expenses are large the Mets lose even more money because they have the highest percentage of their revenues going to I think in 2022 83 percent of of every of all the revenues went into player contracts I mean talk about we think in terms of traditional businesses that's like having a gross margin of four or five percent there's not much room so the last section I'm going to start with the three big drivers about Revenue growth profitability and reinvestment in every single one if you think about MLB collectively things don't look good on revenues the collective revenues of the MLB have been pretty flat and attendance is dropped so it's a flat Revenue business I totally the advertise collectively of 600 million you know companies are barely making money the teams are barely making money so it's low Revenue growth terrible margins you know exactly by valued MLB teams I'm going to get Abyss many loadouts right but they're going to be priced and if you know that this is big you know why the it's always going to be a pricing game as long as a number of professional sports teams is fewer than the number of billionaires you have a scarcity problem right these are true there's a there's a category of assets that I call Trophy assets are the world of historian the financial times remember the the quintessential British Financial was bought by somebody for when somebody said well why would you pay that much for a newspaper that's because you're buying a trophy acid you're buying something where you're not treating it as a business you're buying it for the same reason you buy art which means to price these you've got to find other trophy ads this fits very closely to how you price things so you price professional sports team for looking at other property so the days the Redskins get sold for seven billion guess what happens the data is Cowboys pricing it's going to get them big I'll make a prediction next year when Forbes does the rankings for the NFL the Cowboys which right now who right now are the most valuable NFL franchise are going to see the value Jump by 30 it's a sample size of one one transaction is going to reprice everything very dangerous place to be in pricing all you need is one crazy guy right he goes out and plays three times something should be where everything else gets pushed up and this is I think the Achilles heel of pricing is everything gets scaled up or scaled on basement transactions and you have relatively few transactions you're going to see this play out so after I do the matching I'll send you all the presentation if you're interested the corporate finance presentation for professional sports teams right stakeholders in a professional sport seem very different than stakeholders a company it's about how do you make debt decisions at a sports team so that'll come soon so let's talk about now the the private company today we will come up with a way of adjusting a private company's cost of equity up for the fact that the potential buyer is on the bus we'll also talk about I talked about buyers remorse how you attach a discount upfront the traditional practice is to put a fixed discount 20 to 25 percent it's amazing how this rule of thumb has come into play now private company valuation and let you know Shannon Pratt is a legendary name and Shannon about 1980 or 81 wrote the first book it's called value closely held businesses and he laid up and he did a great job of laying out but along the way also set up rules of thumb which over time got almost reinforced by studies that found that the rule of thumb worked and the rule of thumb in liquidity is you value a private company and you knock off twenty percent or 25 why because private companies are available today I want to challenge that notion first that you automatically take an a liquidity discount and then it has to be the same for every private company in fact just to set up that discussion that's going to come let's suppose that I came to you with four private businesses you're worried about the liquidity in all of them I want you to tell about determining which of these companies would attach the biggest iniquity to discount on and which one you might set for lowering stock the first is a money making cash flow generating company to a long-term buyer you see why the buyer also matters right because it's not just what the business is but how much the buyer cash the second is a profitable cash flow generating company to a cash constrained buyer the third is an unprofitable negative cash flow company to a long-term buyer and the final one is a non-profitable negative cash flow company to a cash constraint buyer which of these are you going to have the largest distributors let's take c and d right what why is having cash flow if you have two companies one produces a lot of positive cash flows others negative cash flows why do you need liquidity Less in the first company what's liquidity you need cash right if the company itself is throwing off cash in a sense it's already partially liquid so money losing company should have bigger your bigger worries about the liquidity than money making customers and you have two potential buyers one is a long-term buyer and presumably long-term buyers you can live with cash flows being low and negative and you don't care about liquidating in the near term and the other is a cash constraint buyer cash constrained buyer will always demand a larger discount because they worry more what if things go wrong already you can see why this is going to create a nightmare in private company evaluation right because if I ask you what discount should I apply to my company first you're going to look at the characteristics of my company it's money making money losing cash flow rich or cash flow poor and then you're going to ask me about the buy right because you cannot come up with a discount without knowing who the potential buyer is if the potential buyer is a long-term buyer who doesn't really need the cash you might make you can try for a lower discount you might not get it but you should start with the price yeah it is valuation but in a sense the value is different to different models with public companies that can't happen because the lower cost buyers get pushed out of the process the market sets the demand and Supply takes care of it with private companies when you see card buyers finding the right buyer can make a big difference in whether you get a billion dollars for your company is 600 million dollars for your company it you know I I tell you know people trying to sell their business is the biggest part of you getting a good value is finding the right part if you find the wrong buy you can finesse it you can negotiate as much as you want but you're negotiating from a position a week so your discount is going to vary across companies it's also going to vary across buyers put Waterbury across time they give you two points of time right after the after this five years later things are looking good economy is coming along the markets doing well which period is the discount going to be large during the crisis I mean now I'm saying your discount is going to be a function not just of the company you're trying to Value but the buyer you're looking at and the time you're around you actually so if you look around and bid ask spreads are rising in publicly traded markets guess what your liquidity discount should also start to go up because you're in scary times and in liquid in Wisconsin where So today we're going to talk about the process of estimating distance and perhaps making it more Dynamic than the 20 to 25 that people take as a standard discount so lots on our lots to do let's get go back to where I left you on Monday I think we were on page is it 134 2.3 yeah so here's what I'm going to do today I'm going to value a private business for a private and private transaction post as I said this is where every conceivable complexity that you can think of comes into play so I'm going to keep it very simple and so you've been asked to assess or said the value of a restaurant that the restaurant owners plan the restaurant owner is right now the chef pretty well known chef and he's planning to sell it to an investment banker so how would an investment this man is tired of invest in banking he's always he's watched so many food shows on Food Network he says Running a Restaurant sounds like so much more fun so he decides to take all of this wealth and this is going to be key to how you think about this all of his wealth that he's earned by spending 20 hours a day for the last 10 years working in Investment Bank and he's going to buy this restaurant so I set it up the rest restaurant is doing pretty well the most recent year it reported 1.2 million in revenues and four hundred thousand dollars in pre-tax operating profit at least according to the restaurants the firm is no conventional debt outstanding but it has one lease they're outstanding where the com the restaurant is paid 120 000 each year for the next 12 years so let's start this process let's start by looking at the financials to make sure that the numbers that the chef is claiming the restaurant makes actually so as I look through the financials so these were these are I could see that the restaurant is growing that's good news but they only promise every seed is now because it's doing well but every system so capacity matters right you can't just keep adding chairs in the middle of the restaurant or in the kitchen to bring people in it's operating in pretty close to full capacity the operating lease expense is given the wages are there but the ownership does not draw a salary why because he owns the restaurant why would he draws out whatever's left comes to him anyway but this is going to be significant because you're going to be buying the restaurant you've got to figure out what to do you've got wages material other operating expenses so basically it looks like the financials are pretty reasonably done nothing is being held back hopefully there's no fraud but there are two things one is these three the least expenses treated as an operating expense this wasn't just him it was everybody was doing this at the time that I did this all companies were doing this the second is that he hasn't charged himself inside if I value the restaurant with the 240 000 as my income and I pay for the restaurant you know the problem I'm going to run into right the day after I buy the restaurant I'm going to walk in and I'm going to notice that there's no food what happened Chef because the owner is gone I can't cook if I could try to cook as the investment banker but my guess is that in the full capacity will go to zero capacity very quickly because how many peanut butter and jellies can you deliver before people say you know what that's a very singular menu item but it's not the only item I came to buy so clearly I've got to correct for that as well so we've talked about that correction that kicks in but you have to leave so let's start with the discontract part because it's a more manageable part you know it's about that that I'm worried about the most because of this Diversified non-diverse so conventional risk and return models of course you assume investors are Diversified with private businesses if the buyer with the buyer who's not Diversified this is going to break down and we already talked about which direction so if I were to set this up basically a traditional beta is going to look at only the market risk I've got to figure out a way to bring in the rest of the risk into accomplish if you remember the regression balance we did you know when you look at regression database for a publicly traded company you'd see a bank that's a raw beta regression babe so think of looking at a Bloomberg beta got the raw beta but on that blue Buffet the page there's also an r squared reported for each company remind me again what that r squared tells me in a typical beta impression foreign how much what expects how much of the previous but in this case what's the data that I'm trying to explain um how much of the variation in stock returns is explained by the market in other words the r squared is a is a measure of the proportion of the variance in this company that is claimed by the market so what's 1 minus the r squared it's a portion of the variance that's not explained by the market so if I can get this for every restaurant company then you could argue well maybe I can find how much of the risk so here's what I started with I started by looking at regression bases for restaurants and I very quickly decided wasn't the right sample to me why because this was an opera an upscale restaurant was drawing people with so I actually switched years and I went with the beta for high-end reader saying the type of people who come to either a high-end restaurant are not the type of people who go into McDonald's that's not it basically I'm you know it's it's a flexibility we sell them used because we're so caught up in Industry groupings that we sometimes don't step back and say hey what's the right group of companies that I should be using for the beta so what's the the unleavened beta for those higher retailers was 1.18 so I'm starting for this it's 1.1 but here's where the fact that the buyer is not Diversified is going to throw me on if I use that 1.18 beta I'm focusing only on the market risk in the comment right so think of this as an algebra if I can somehow tell you how much risk is not Market risk this private the private buyer is going to be exposed to all of those units as well so I'm going to take the market bait and scale it that reflect the rest of those with what that's where the correlation comes in so basically if you look at the r squared it was 25 across these numbers the variant variance in a typical restaurant is explained by the market here's a little statistical twist here beta is a standard deviation measure anybody remember the beta the equation for a beta it's correlation between the stock and the market times the standard deviation the stock and the numerator divided by the sigma of the market so it's a standard deviation you think so what I'm going to take the square root of the r squared which of course gives me the correlation coefficient the reason I use the correlation coefficient beta is a standard deviation measure so I'm going to stay with the standard deviation analog the square root of 0.25 is 0.5 1.18 divided by 0.5 gives me a total beta I'm going to call this a total beta specifically because I'm capturing total risk rather than this Market risk it's always going to be higher than your Market beta how much it depends the correlation of the business you're in with the market the lower the correlation the bigger the total beta is going to be relevant in the market beta because I'm bringing in the rest of the risk calculation somebody back there at a question yep question yes independent variable is always each restaurant each publicly traded restaurant so you know you I'm not running a regression of restaurants collectively I'm running a regression regression of each publicly traded so if I take Chipotle I take the returns and chipotle run against the s p final to get a bait and r squared so I do this for each company so it's exactly like the bottom-up Ada process but now I've brought in the r squared as well so what you see are the averages across public prepaid address so my total weight is 2.3 that 2.36 is my unleavened bail unleavened topic with publicly traded companies after you got non-level beta you leveled up debate right and to leverage what you need a market value of debt and a market value of equity as a second problem we run into private companies we don't have Market values I know you're tempted to say let me go with book values there there don't that's not even on my choice list it's not going to work so I want to estimate the market value debt to equity you can try something that's never worked for me you can call the owner of a private business say what's your target debt to equity ratio you'll have no idea what you're talking about so hang up the phone very quickly because it'll open you up to two choices you have in terms of a debt to equity ratio in this private company one is you can look at publicly traded companies look at their debt to equilibrations in this case there have been about 14.33 for publicly traded restaurants and say if a publicly traded restaurant has a debt ratio that must come from the kind of business they're in and every private business in that space will have the same unsatisfying but it's quick right you take the industry average debt to equity you plug it in you come up with the Leverage is there another way you could do this so I cannot use Book value I can use industry averages but then I'm assuming that private companies and public companies in that space have the same data equipment that'll give me a cost of debt though it won't give me a way of getting that that the equity value right the big missing variable is the ad code event the debt I can live with the book that which we do with public companies do you have an estimated value where could you get out of this process yeah you do a DCF you value The Firm you subtract Hardware to get a value back with it right could I use that estimated value to get debt equity I could but there's a little bit of a catch what's the problem I'm going to run into Circle forward I'm going to have Clarity right check the iteration box in Excel it's magical try it out and use your estimated value of equity as the equity in a debt to equity ratio what you create is a debt to equity ratio that's consistent with your estimated value of equity to the company but the iteration box has to be on because if it's not you're going to get arrows all over your spreadsheet you want to blow up on okay but it's actually a choice with private companies do you know why I don't you do this with public companies why do we use market value again for Publications it's not because the market is right but because that's what it would cost me to go buy the company so market value equities public companies is because it's a trend here I'm saying there's no transaction yet I'm going to be the guy who comes up with the transaction number and you're using your estimated value of equity then to come up with a debt to equitation now while the lease that is treated at least expensive screen is an operating expense I'm going to do what I've always done which is capitalized leases and come up with a synthetic ratings the synthetic rating I came up with was 3.33 which gave me an interest coverage ratio rating so basically you know what I'd suggested I'm basically use so the cost of debt is the easier part right because you can use a synthetic rating for any company including a private company the rating is just an intermediate Starbucks come up with a default spread my free tax cost for debt is seven point five percent my half that is positive debt at least this is four and a half so I have 11 total beta I have a pre-tax cost debt my cost of capital using that lever total debate and the cost to debt is 13.25 it's higher than it would be for a public company because I'm using the total beta rather than the market so that was my first stop is getting a discount rate so it's really A variation of what I do with public companies with one small twist right but the only twist was I took the market paid and I scaled it up and the other minor Choice was the debt to equity ratio I had to make this judgment or do I go with an industry average so my phone estimated dollars I put in a cost for the share 150 000 and obviously I've got to go do my homework how much will it cost me to get a world record chef at the restaurant put that in this expense that lowest my income but capitalizing leases as the as an effective pushing up and operating input my operating income after the correction is instead of being you know for 400 million is 370. lower operating income because their additional salary and the conversion of leases to them any questions on the cleaning up here now to the extent that those financials to begin with were solid my work was relatively simple right one of my one of the classic problems in private company evaluation especially in Asia and Latin America is you go and ask the owner to show you their financials they will give you the financials and you take one look at this country right you're losing money every single year why these are my official financials for the tax guy and then you'll have to go into a back room lock the door make sure that nobody can see you and the second set of financials come out which is the unofficial financials which reflect what the company actually made so those are things you have to do with private companies and presumably you don't have to worry as much with public conference so I've got the discount rate I've got the the financials near done I have to factor in that the share Chef who was owning the restaurant until yesterday is now leaving I'm hiring a new chef but the customers who came to the restaurant came because of the old ship haven't figured out how much of my revenues in this case I've made an assumption of 20 but how do you come up with this percentage that you're going to lose because we keep us you'd probably have to have somebody's hand outside the restaurant and do some kind of a survey or to get some sense of how many of you will be back tomorrow if I told you there's a different Chef in the kitchen some people might come for the atmosphere they say I don't care who the chef is but there's no easy way to get this without having a gauge of how much loyalty customers have to the particular Chef or owner and how many of those customers will leave finally I mean I can't just because I'm being a private company forget about my fundamentals remember to grow I have to reinvest money in this case the return of capital that I estimated was about 20 based on their book values for which I can I can do this for the private also a public company I put in a stable growth rate why stable growth rate remember I said they're already at 100 capacity and two percent growth rate in perpetually and if my return to Capital and growth rate right in a steady state model they will have to reinvest 10 you're saying where's the reinvestment going you've got to probably upgrade the restaurant so even though it's lead space physically you got to keep the restaurant looking good that 10 reflects the reinvestment you're making in capital Investments you've got to make to keep this restaurant at all so I think I'm ready to Value the restaurant I take the adjusted habit I come up with the cost of capital just for the fact that you've got a key person discount I come up with the cost of capital reinvestment rate so I've got my free cash for the firms there's my operating income grown out one year one minus the tax rate one minus the reinvestment rate so that's free cash for the firm written as one item divided by classic Capital minus 12 the value that I get for the restaurant overall is 1.449 see is that the value that I expect well not quite yet right because you have the least debt to subtract now to subtract not the least that the value that he gets the restaurant is 521 000. sounds astonishingly low right because the operating income is worth 300 000 looks like I'm paying only two times off per year but by the time you take out the tax effect the reinvestment effect it works at about five times in after tax earnings in the most recent year and it's slow because the buyer is not Diversified demanding a 13.25 percent discount but there's one more final step to do right that's the value that I get for the restaurant after adjusting for the fact that the buyer is not divorced but there's an a liquidity issue that still has not been done the question is how big a discount do I need to attach to this 521 000 and as I said that discard can't be one number for every company can't be a single rule of that can't be 20 for every company and as you saw in the pre pre-class test where it should vary across companies it should vary across time and it should vary across points so at least I'll give you a template on how to think about a little discount it might not give you a precise answer but that template comes from first looking at how this rule of thumb came to be the Shannon Road I think his book in 1981 he set up a film called William Ed in Oregon and still started creating research to back up because remember many of these things end up in court you know a private company appraisal it gets you know for the tax guy for the divorce court it ends up in court so they wanted to create an infrastructure that backed up these discounts you can go to court and say look there's a study that backs it up and if you look at private Company discounts the studies that back up the discounts come from two sets of studies one are studies of what are called restricted stock you know what restricted sources it's actually publicly traded companies that issue shares to the market with restrictions on their shares on trade so the Restriction will be I think originally it used to be two years you could not trade after you got the shares the nice thing about restricted stock is you can actually observe the discount right the problem with the liquidity discounts is usually their own observable if you looked at private company what people pay for private companies so how much of that with the liquid or discount nobody knows right you see the price that was spent but in the restricted stock can observe the discount why because these are publicly traded companies you can see their stock price you could see the price people paid for the restricted stock and because the price is low you can say how much lower than the market price they pay because they could not trade for the next two years I'm going to show you some of the evidence that comes from restricted stock studies and why you shouldn't trust it you know if you build a whole infrastructure of Wisconsin looking at what happens pre-ipo remember you have a private company it's going to go public in three months in those three months often you have transactions between owners VCS and founders of selling it and if you can observe the price on what they pay any compared to the IPO price at least in theory you can argue that discount was because they could not wait to enables lots of flaws in the logic but maybe that's in the liquid so both cases I'm going to argue that you've got a sampling virus and we'll talk about what that sampling bias is and that sampling bias will show up but in both cases what you're doing is you're comparing the discounted price you're getting on the restricted shares and the pre-ipo transactions the market price and estimating this so let's talk about the restricted stock starts they started in the late 70s and over time they're all consistently showed discounts at 25 30 35 percent it's great for a presence you know why because most appraisal is for tax reasons we want low number it served private company appraisers well to have these studies back them up when they say we have a 25 discount or 30 and here's a restricted stocks most of these studies just compute a median discount so they'll have dozens and dozens of restricted stock transactions they'll take the median discount 25 years ago uh 35 years ago now Bill silbo used to teach it he used to keep the foundations class I think he did this almost as a summer paper decide to take those restricted stock transactions they say rather than compute the media and I want to see why the discounts vary across different restricted stock offerings and he ran a regression and I talked about why I'm even showing you the regression but it took the log of the price to the the discontent the restricted stock price to the actual market price so think of that as one minus the discount on the left hand side against the level of revenues arguing that higher Revenue companies should have smaller discounts against um what how big the restricted stock offering was larger block offering should have bigger discounts whether the company was making money it's a dummy bearing earnings making money and not making money they're companies making money should have smaller discounts and if the person buying the restricted stock was a customer he argued that because of that you might end up a smaller discount because the customer gets other benefits they ran into the cross-restring so after these are all statistically significant his objective was to sure look there's a median discount but it varies across easy lifted it I'm going to take bills regression and use it to come up with a way of varying discounts across companies and here's what I did if you look at that regression yes coefficients on whether the company is making money or losing money right he also is coefficient how big the revenue is so I took a company and let the revenues change and also made the company go from money making to money losing and using the same regression here's what the discounts look like depending on the level of revenues and whether the company's money making or money used so let's say you're a company with 25 million in revenues that's a money-making company based on the regression the discount should be above 24 but if that same company is losing money that has gone should be 32 percent if you compare that to a billion dollar company billion dollar company that's making money the discount should be 18 so essentially I'm taking the regression and coming up with the way of saying if you came in with the business and say how much my discount here I'm going to ask you two questions one is how much were your revenues last year and did you make money and if you can give me the revenues whether you made a lost money I can go in and say based on those characteristics this is what you're just contributing very simplistic extension of what the original regression did to be able to differentiate across companies so let's say either you know what that side is to remember so let's talk about one yeah go ahead is that like yes this is the people in the industry like sector that they are in shouldn't matter right restrictions or restrictions right why would you care less about a discount in one industry than another give me the intuition because then I can start to bring it in what is it about I mean say like the grocery stores so you're saying save for businesses should have smaller discounts that Risky Business eye cream right if you were rerunning service regression what would you do how would you bring that in you can't throw it in Industry specific because they're not enough observation right these are small samples so I can't just say I'm going to do just grocery store restricted stock that's not a choice but I can bring into the regression another variable and that variable might measure variability earnings in a sector and the argument be high variance earnings should lead to bigger discounts and low varying signs so if you're going to go the restricted stock round that's what you would do is add variables I'm going to point to a fundamental problem with restricted stock studies that I think you can't make go away no matter how much you slicing times today what did I say about this stock when you place it you essentially those people can't trade the strawberry and you're settling forward 30 discount 25 discount 20 discount that's a lot of money to leave in the table right so when you think about the kinds of companies and issue restricted so no healthy companies ever going to issue restrictions it's just too much left on the table so almost by exclusion the kinds of companies that issue restricted stock tend to be money losing companies distressed companies companies that are of all kinds of risk soil what you have is a sampling buyer that giving you too big a risk it took the IRS 20 years to come up with this kind of product from the mid 80s all the way through 2002 or 2003 you know appraisers went in front of Courts and said look the restricted stocks already said discount of 30 to 35 they got away with it because there was no pushback so finally the IRS hired somebody who knew enough statistic that they could take the restricted stock studies and figure out how much of that discount came from the fact that these were trouble companies distressed companies small companies and statistically there's a way to break it up and he concluded that about 25 to 35 discount came from the sampling bias you take that out you discount all of a sudden goes from 35 to 10 percent it's a moment of Awakening for a lot of private company and prices because For the First Time and they went to court and said we applied a 35 discount because the restricted stock study said it was okay you had a counter of somebody saying but most of that has nothing to do with the liquidity how can you take the 35 discount and apply it in a healthy private company that shares none of the characteristics of the company that issued restrictions so so when you look at restricted stock studies they look like the discount is large but after you correct for that sampling bias the discounts become much smaller so let me give you an altern restricted stock story The IPO studies are even worse I don't believe in single word that comes under the IPO strategy because they find discounts at 50 let me ask you a question you're a venture capitalism a firm that's planning to go public in three months you expect the price to be thousand dollars per share would you accept 500 per share I wouldn't so what does that tell me there's something wrong with these standards either they're making up the numbers or they're missing something critical and what I think they're missing is every company that planned to go public to their all companies that plan to go public actually go for them the promise they're missing the sampling bias comes to the fact that they're missing the companies where you have these sales but the IPO falls apart right so you're counting only IPO companies working backwards and by doing that you're creating sampling bias that's killing your sons so if you don't press restricted stock studies you don't press type years you're saying what the heck should I do in China actually it's a very interesting test because you have the same stock listed in Shenzhen Exchange in the Hong Kong it's saying they trade a different crisis and part of that is in a liquidity issue which is a Hong Kong exchange it's more liquid you know you'd expect the price and exchange is higher because the restrictions in Chinese investors so clean test liquidity is really difficult so here's what I'm going to do remember I said there's a cost of buyers remorse even when you buy publicly traded shares what's that cost it's a bid ask spreader the bid ask spread is the liquidity discount for a publicly traded companies saying but it's so small you're right if you take a cup like apple or Microsoft a bit ad spread is less than 0.2 percent of the market price but if you go to a lightly traded stock on the NASDAQ let's say it's trading at two dollars don't be surprised to see a bit aspirate of 50 cents on that stock 50 cents divide by two dollars is a 25 delivery discount so even among publicly traded companies there's an eloquent interest card it's called the bid ask think of how much bigger your sample size just got right you can take every publicly traded stock you can compute the spread as a percentage of the price for every stock you got an a liquid in discount for every stock and now your sample size because it's thousands of stock you can run the regression against level of rep some things that you can observe for a private company as well so about 15 years ago I decided to run this regression the fact that I have not Revisited tells you how much of a pain it was to do I don't value private companies so I don't particularly care what the liquid reduce card is but if I cared I would rerun this regression every year so I took the bid ask spread divided by the stock price for every publicly trade company that became the left-hand side of the equation on the right hand side I threw in three variables level of revenues like Bill silver did for the Restriction stock I threw it in there hypothesizing that higher Revenue companies should have smaller but as per that's a percenter value second I threw in cash as a personal firm value arguing that companies with a lot of cash should have smaller bid aspects because they're less risky in a sense cash is liquid and finally I threw in the monthly trading board arguing that more liquid stocks were lowest price now I'm running it across Europe the Oxford is not bad I came out no I don't remember what the actual number was 30 maybe 30 to 40 percent and I could have kept adding variables but the variables I had should be variables I could get for a private business you sent me so if I took the restaurant that I just gave you and plugged in the revenues for the restaurant 1.2 million the fact that it's a money making company the cash was five percent value and never tricks to put in a zero trading volume I get a predicted bit aspect for the company of 12.88 given how the market bid aspect vary across public companies treating this private business like a public company gives me a spread of 1.88 I now have a weapon I can use for every private company as long as they could squeeze it through this bit asper depression so if you look at the variation here I if I use the traditional just 25 for every company let's call it the bludgeon approach you can take this silver regression and refine it for the level of revenues and it's a money making company I get a 28.75 discount but the badass spread approach gives me a discount that's far lower and I think the 12.88 is a more viable reasonable discount because it doesn't have that sampling bias that permeates the first two approaches so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the 521 000 and estimated the value of equity to be and knockoffs 12.88 of that bad to come up with the value backward for this company so it's going to end up at like 440 000 by the time I'm all done yes the fact that buyers you know that's going to be tougher right because I don't observe virus in the public market and I use a bit aspect regression I I don't observe the bar right the whole I observe is the trade happening and the spread but in the private space perhaps one way to get a measure of the liquidity discount is take private company transactions and separate them into private company transactions with cash constrained buyers we have to Define and private company transactions with Buyers who don't care if it's long-term buyers and the hypothesis is true the discount should be lower for the long-term buyer group and maybe you can start quantifying the problem as I said is people have become so used to applying this rule of doubt that nobody wants with the Dirty Work of actually building up in a liquid prescribe from scratch nobody's too strong but very few people want to deal with it they'd prefer to keep this 20 to 25 and just move on and I think we need to go back and look at a liquidity more carefully and how to bring it out now I also believe that in private company evaluation a lot of people double count and deliberate the way they do it is many private companies the way they built up to a discount rate is not with the total data but what's called the build up approach I call it the make it up approach because yes I've got you started the risk period so you'd stop at the public company right the build-up approach you start adding things you add a small cap ring four percent a company specific risk premium which is completely made out seven percent and it look so basically they keep adding things so they get to a number that they're comfortable with or 22 that sounds about right which my response is that's where you want it to end up why did you go through this charade of acting like you got there by adding up numbers Based on data because 22 was the number you wanted to use the problem is if you do decide to use a small cap room which I don't think you should and small cap companies earn higher returns because they're less liquid pushing up the discount rate is going to push down the value you knock another 25 of that value for a liquidity didn't you punish the company twice once we're pushing up the discount rate so I think if you're going to deal with the liquidity it's got to be transparent it's got to be in one place here I'm dealing with there's a discounted value if you prefer to build it as a higher discount rate bring it in but have come up with ways of adjusting the discount rate then for a liquid kindness so that's private to private you could see the diversification effect that pushed up your cost of equity that's liquidity discounts every conceivable nightmare evaluation came into play yes that's actually a very good question where did the buyer of private Equity investor who's sector Focus so you know they're Diversified by the Diversified across 25 you know manufacturing companies or steel companies and software companies first if you create a portfolio of 25 software companies what I computed as a correlation was in one was an individual software companies if I create a portfolio of 25 software companies so the correlation of the market go up will go down it's going to go up it's not going to go to one because you're not fully Diversified so your potential buyer is partially Diversified there's sector Focus what you'll observe is that you'll have to compute a correlation for an index so for instance software company index ETF with uh with the market that correlation will be higher than an individual software company and you replace your correlation that you originally used with the higher correlation what if your potential investor is a vcules diversified across different businesses then your correlation is going to start drifting towards one these are the consequences right it's going to push down your cost rate Equity it's going to push up what you're willing to get it's what KKR and Blackstone have done to the private Equity businesses by becoming these more Diversified investors who are themselves publicly traded they've removed the need to charge for company specific risk and they're competing against more traditional sector Focus they're going to beat them out they go head to head they're going to win almost every single time with the same set of cash flows but they can afford to pay a higher price not because they're overpaying but because they feel less of the risk so I think even in the VC business change is coming because the old BCS tend to be very very sect to focused staying within a subset of software a subset of I think that's starting to change it's starting to affect how much people are willing to demand are willing to accept as a cost of that life so let's move to the second scenario it's private to publicly traded life becomes so much easier your potential buyers are publicly traded company what's the risk you should be building into your cost about whose money are they investing their investment is money right they're publicly traded their investors are Diversified I can go back to a market paid at this total paid out so it's not we don't put in a total beta because the company is private but because the buyer was not Diversified here you've taken it to the Limit the buyers is potentially fully Diversified a public company buys my business how much of an in liquidity discount should I attached what do I care about the liquidity I can trade the shares of the public company the need for a liquidity went away in other words if I replace my private numbers if buyers public I can go back to a market beta I can remove the liquidity discount and I'm going to get a much lower cost of capital and a much higher value for the same business yeah maybe I don't understand but if you're a public company that buys the private company your investors can sell their shares anytime they want so with public companies that's why otherwise providing public company is going to be a nightmare right because you can think of every public company as a collection of illiquid assets take tests I mean you have a bunch of illiquides in those factories so if I decide to start attaching liquidity discounts to what public companies own because if they sold that asset they might have to set up a discount I'm going to open up an entire can of worms so it's because their investors can buy and sell the  they stop having to put in a penalty but if I remove the total beta effect and I remove the electrical discount the value goes from 450 3000 to 1.5 million this is a diversify that let's not bringing the word strategic that scares me but a diversified buyer will be willing to pay a higher price and in fact the negotiating process right you're the seller you know that I'm Diversified but I know that your alternatives are not Diversified so you know what what the negotiation is going to come down to so you're going to have two numbers in your pocket as you said you're going to have the 453 000 which is what you'd get from another potential antiversified value of the 1.5 million that you would get you're going to start your bidding at one point you say look no you're not Diversified you're I mean you're Diversified you don't care about liquidity how about what you know what I'm going to counter with [Music] so I'm going to count it for fifty four thousand and if I am the only Diversified buyer in the game the ultimate transaction price is going to be closer to the 453 000 than the one you know the one I remember when we talked about we talked about acquisition the one area of acquisitions where there's potential valuation it's very difficult to create value from acquisition so one area whether it's value value creation Acquisitions is publicly traded companies that are created by Roll-Ups of private businesses right Browning Ferris went around the country buying up garbage disposal companies Blockbusters days of Glory went around buying video rental stores across you said how do they create value because they offered the owners of these businesses a higher number that they can get from any private transaction but a much lower number than what they can afford to pay you get to keep the difference as long as you only the second player entered the game all bets are off right because then the bidding wars are going to start but you can see that there are two value for the same business depending on who's looking at it and as a potential seller you'd like the public buyer value and you're going to try to negotiate towards it but you might not get it and the Congress experience a division of a public asset yeah it depends on what the end game is most private Equity we use itself as a transitory fares you buy an asset not because you want to keep it as a private business but because you want to flip it back to the public as a public business so if private Equity Funds are actually buying companies to keep them private it would be very difficult for them to justify the price that they're paying because they'd be offering well below the market price but because they view this as we plan a definition of success in private Equity is you hold it for two or three years then you exit by either selling to a public company or by taking it public yourself so the effect of the lack of diversification tends to be smaller and becomes even smaller for private Equity players like a KKR or Blackstone and says look I'm Diversified anyway I'm going to look at the top 17 shareholders 23 Guess Who they were right entirely stagedy BlackRock was not around there companies don't have to be Diversified the investors and companies have to be the first that's why the public company becomes so easy to meet the diversification test right if I require companies to be Diversified there are very few companies in the world that could meet that task but I don't need it all I need is you being in the market investors in your company to be do this so if you think about the prices you've got two extreme values 453 000 1.48 million where you will end up will be entirely a function of what the relative numbers are on each side there are lots of potential public buyers for your business you end up closer to the 1.48 million conversely there's only one public part a lot of private buyers you're going to end up close to the four fifty three thousand and somebody's going to claim the difference the question is isn't the seller or the buyer and depending on the sector depending on the company one side of the other could potentially walk away as the one so in many ways I mean you know I the part of India that I grew up in retail from this product through much of India these small stores where people buy stuff tiny little and last time I was in my hometown in a long time I was walking around said look the same and I was talking to the shop owners and it turns out that private Equity investors have actually been very active in that shop one of these small shop ones where they actually go in and buy 50 of the shop and they offer them what looks like a bargain price or a high price to the shop owner because they'd sold it to another shop owner that have got a lower number but effectively it's private Equity investors coming in an arbitraging the space between being a private business with all these penalties and a public company where you're removing the diversification discount so that's why if you look at where private Equity is most active it's most active now in markets with that space is Big a lot of Asia Latin America even Europe there are a lot of businesses that are still dominating but public a privately owned businesses rather than publicly traded companies and those are the spaces where there's a chance to exploit different perceptions of risk in the same time so private to private private Department let's talk about what's different if a private company plans to go for an initial public offer so you're doing the valuation because you want to take the there are a couple of issues you want to deal with one is that when you make a public offering there is a process you've got to go through there are now challenges the process but the traditional process is you went and hired an invest in Banker the investment banker valued your company let's back that up it's really not valuable price to your company and then they guarantee an offering price sounds too good to be true right they guarantee they will deliver that price and then there's an offering day and the Market opens up so this is the process that for a century in the US has governed how companies that process is embedded a couple of issues that you have to come up with so let me take an example this is actually from Twitter's IPO so I usually value companies when they file their prospectus so in an IPO in the US you file a prospect there's about six eight ten weeks before you go public and I do the valuation almost instantaneously after the prospectus inspired because I have no idea what the price would be because if you wait then prices start to there'll be rumors that the bank is offering this and it starts to permeate yet the value that I came up with for Twitter on on the day of its prospector is 17.36 if you look at this valuation it looks very similar to a typical public company evaluation right you could say about pre-clause doesn't use your Market beta so it looks very similar to a public company evaluation but there are a couple of things in this valuation that make it a little bit the first is on the offering day shares of the company are offered to the public and cash comes into the account right that's cash flows I mean you to figure out first what percentage shares will be offered to but okay you have to tell me what you plan to do with that cash for me to complete this webinar you see what do you mean what you can do what are the what are the different things that a company can do with the cash it raises on an IP one is it can allow existing owners to cash out so it's really not dividends because you're not quite public but you can say okay you want to cash out when Spotify went public the entire proceeds were cached out by existing on so that's one shot so you can cash up what else can you do one is you can hold this cash because you don't want to reinvestments daily switch the day after the IPO the cash balance for a company is going to balloon out by the amount that came up the third is if you have taken on Venture debt or any debt with high interest rates you can pay it down so you have to tell me what you plan to do with the cash because without doing it I can't complete the valuation if you plan to keep it on your balance sheet as a cash balance I'm going to increase the cash value or whatever the programs are on the day Alibaba went public I had 16 billion dollars to the cash balance it went from the value went from 145 billion to 161 billion because 16 billion is what they raised in the offering day and they were planning to hold it in the company so over it's almost overnight the company becomes more value it's a cash gun if Alibaba planned to use the cash to pay down debt that 16 billion would not show up in the cash balance show up as a lower debt ratio and presumably a different cost of capital there's a 16 billion were cashed out by existing owners I'm going to act like it never existed in in any way because this goes out of the company yes so the certification is available in the prospectus usually keep if you read the prospectus and pick up any Prospectors there will be a section where they tell you what they plan what they plan to do with the proceed it's a requirement in every prospectus and you can see what that is before you manage the car we're not reinvesting in income tax that is the cash isn't waiting right the reason they went public so Alibaba eventually invested this but the day after the IPO you're not you don't know where they'll invest so this actually becomes a way of covering their negative free cash flow Equity if they had it for the next three or four years so this actually offsets that negative effect by saying I've raised the money already for the next three okay and if the company was incisions I'll tell you where it shows up remember failure radar test if I value this company before the IPO with those negative cash flows the next five years I'd probably attach a high failure rate because I'm saying you have to go raise the capital what if it doesn't happen let's see this company does an IPO and it's Rich enough that they can raise the cash to cover the next five years of cash flows still the same cash flows it puts the cash balance but my failure rate which I'm going to be 25 the day before the ideal can drop to five because they now have the cash to survive those stuff years so I think that's the best place to show it discounts on cash you probably don't want to do it at the IPO station because you haven't given the management the chance to show that they're and they're young companies you really don't have a sense of how good they are as custodians without cash so let's talk about the issues in an IPO evaluation that make a difference first is what do you plan to do with the process as I said you've got to tell me what that is second by the time a company goes public it's done all kinds of special needs remember each VC round comes with its own financing where you promise that we see all kinds of neat things sometimes it takes up from a special type of common stock and then sometimes warrants or options your job is to clean up to make sure that when you take the company public you're counting all of that stuff those evaluation issues talk about the pricing issue what did the investment banker guarantee you a price right so let's say you as an investment banker price a company at twenty dollars would he guarantee the twenty dollars as your option so you want the discount it's Human Nature and invest makers are actually open about the fact that they discount if you read the the the the the manual that investment bankers who go into IPOs again and they said come up with the value for the company or pricing for the company and take off 15 years where did the 15 person come from I have no idea it's become built into the process take a disc so we're gonna have to deal with that when you look at the pricing of the company but in the valuation it's kind of a side issue so let's talk about the proceeds it can be taken out of the firm as was in sport if I used to pay down debt but you sometimes see at companies that have accumulated especially a large amount of bridge financing or it can be held as cash in the company if it's taken out of the firm you can completely ignore it it comes in and it goes out of the other window so it doesn't change anything in your evaluation if it's used to pay down debt it's going to change your debt ratio and your cost of capital and if it's kept as cash it's going to increase your cash balance creating that jump in value on the on the opening day and this is sometimes called free money post money I don't know what they even want to use that language post IPO you get that extra money coming in to DCF Value Plus that extra cash now in the case of Twitter they actually have a very explicit so that's a responsible this is right in the prospective they said they were going to raise about a billion dollars in the offering and they said they were planning to keep it at the company because they might need the cash for their reinvestment so my valuation I'm going to keep the billion dollars but if they told me that somebody was cashing on I know who the BC is and whatever maybe one of one of those VCS said we want to just take our money out then how do we ignore the billion dollars so don't automatically add the proceeds to your cash balance check the the prospect is supposed to be true the claims from prior Equity investors do what we do in traditional valuation to extend the options out there and rights and special deals clean up for all of that because that's going to come out of your own and in the money out of the money and one of the nice things about an IPO again is all these multiple classes of shares will get Consolidated and converted to Common startups when Facebook went public there were seven classes of because every VC route had created so on with us the day of the offering all of those got converted into common shares so it makes your life easier but getting a share at a you know in an IPO is really messy right the prospectus will be all over the place there's Council and don't take the number that they give you as gospel because then they would say right below that they would say but we've excluded the following and they will list our restricted stock so your job is to take things that they've excluded and bring it back into the game because it is going to affect your value of equity is about so the existing investors have special claims value them take them out of your value because they are going to come up with those special tips we see that special options to buy extra shares those will reduce your value so the Twitter at 7 class of convertible preferred stock 86 million restricted stock 44.16 million options all of this came right out of the Prospectors the 44.16 million options I'm going to Value as options so basically I do with what I do with traditional companies all of the other shares including non-bestive restricted shares I count as shares outstanding I know some bankers can't only vested shares I think that's bad practices count all of the shares outstanding because somebody has a large block of non-invested shares I can almost guarantee they're going to hang around to get the invested so even though it looks non-invested for the moment they're going to end up being best so that's the the and finally as the investment banking guarantee the way it shows up it will show up as a discount on whatever your values it's a discount because you're guaranteed the Press now in return for so the investment banking what are the services investment bankers offer IPS let's go down the list underwriting so once a guarantee the pricing guarantee what else book run in which case they offer a seller so book Runner basically means you know they're getting on the phone or whatever the equivalent is in the digital age they're contacting portfolio manage they're doing Road shows essentially so they're selling your shares what else are they having your company that used to be one of the less you know we put a value on your company and that was put as service they also after after the offering do they leave no they offer aftermarket support which means they will buy shares Morgan Stanley which was the you know which was which is the the Investment Bank of Facebook and the week after the offering of the price was collapsing came in and bought yet they'll do it only up to a certain amount so the whole host of services Bankers claim to offer an IP but nice people right in return though what do you leave the table for the last century but let's take a look at all of the things that Bankers did for IPOs and asked are they still valuable today the selling part right it's a big deal in the old days why because nobody had heard about your company Goldman Sachs would have to get on and tell people you know this is what the company does I would wait to more people had heard about Facebook than Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley at the time Facebook went published so the higher the profile of companies the less you need the banker right because people know what you do we know the pricing that Bankers provide this valuation is a is a joke how do we know it because whatever number they come up with it seems to double with the offering day so they're that good about even pricing the company it shouldn't be so every one of the services as you go down it turns out that they're less useful or not useful at all today which is one reason why Bill Gurley I want the leading VCS on it's on value I have an argument with a bad Uber as raise the glass now why are we doing this why do we need Bankers what's your turn instead of going through banks and setting and offering price a direct listing which is like an auction right basically that's you know so basically what you do is you bypass the process you don't set a price you let the demand Supply set the price in the opening day there's no discard property leaving no money on the table but it does come with the catch please right now you make a direct listing you're not allowed as a company to keep the cash that's why Spotify had to return the cash was a direct listing but that's fixable and direct listings are not going to work for everyone if your company had nobody's heard about you can try direct listing but people might not demand so there are still companies where I think the old the old Services matter but I think it's good to open it up and of course there's a third alternative right it's facts which is a completely you look about it completely inefficient way Miss back what do you do you trust chamat palapatia it defines you know I'm picking him because you have what 11 facts at one point in time you pick a high profile investor who you think knows more about technology than you do you assume he would find so he doesn't even tell you what company is going to buy it's giving it to him and trusting I I think you can find a company with this three billion and he says trust me I'll find the right company I'll negotiate the right price I'll get you a great deal and in return for this what did you get the typical is bad 20 of your money foreign there's nobody who's smart enough and special enough to make up that 20 this isn't going to stand well and of course while it did really well in 2020 and 2021 it's completely Fallen apart because many of these facts basically have nothing behind them so you really have three ways of going public one is the old-fashioned higher bankers at an offering price with all of its limits you've got direct listings where you've got institutional constraints that might get in the way and if you're a low profile company it's still a problem third is we're it's a work in progress I don't think we've arrived at the final conclusion but you're seeing all three processes and fine yeah go ahead SCC requirements and direct listing the SEC wants to protect you from yourself they view direct listings as having a potential they actually think Bankers are good screeners of scams so basically you won't get they're worried that companies will go directly to the market fool investors so they've set up all the structure supposed protection for the investment they may they want to make historically they're not encouraged her replacement they didn't want companies to directly list because if that might lead to scams so those institutional constraints remain remember one of the choices you have with the offer proceeds is to keep it as a cash balance which is one reason companies go public if they want to raise cash with capex if I don't let you do that then it's a big it's a potential disadvantage and that's a problem right now with the right listings is you cannot use it has to be cashed after hours so you're doing Spotify did let bonus kind of cash so as finally in terms of pricing we already I already talked about how I price Twitter I looked at the number of users I multiplied by a hundred dollars per user so it's a pricing process but you can see that IPOs are all pricing all the time I don't know I don't even know why IPO bank is even bother with this kind of cash flow valuations because it's a price again have you look actually look at what happens on the offering day in an IPO on average the price jumps about 15 to 20 some doubled Summit triples you know but on average upside 15. this sounds like a great way to make money right so tell me as a greedy investor how you take advantage of it all the shares but you got to buy the shares right so first you got to get in on the offer here so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to take the next 100 IPOs I'm going to ask for a thousand shares in every one of them sure fire away of making money right people have tried and it hasn't worked so tell me what what goes wrong when I set up a strategy saying look I'm going to buy every IPO that comes comes into the market and I'm going to ask for a thousand checks what what's going to go wrong but but you make it sound like bad because of a conspiracy against you but think about this process right there's demand and supply for the shares in those companies where Bankers have underpriced the shares there will be too many people asking per share so the thousand shares you ask for you might get 200 or 150. even if it's a fair process because there are five times as many people asking for shares in their shares outstanding everybody gets only one fifth though so you get 200 shares in the most overcrowd in the most underpriced companies the companies that are overpriced how many of the shares that you ask for who you get you'll get a thousand their colleagues do you want more I can give you another thousand never take the extra thousand if you get that call because the fact that you get that card you're terrified so you see what's going to happen your end portfolio is going to be overweighted in your overpriced stock and under weighted in your underpriced costs that's why mutual fund in fact I remember these first studies came out in the market people said you know we can make money on this some and I know a couple of people started mutual funds to invest just in IPOs when you look at their actual returns not seeing any of this excess return there and it's because of the process one other question I said that there's a this discount of 15 on average that's money out of the pocket of the founders right and the VCS that's a sounds like money you don't want to leave in the table historically companies seem to have been okay with it why first if you look at how what percentage of the shares are offered on the offering day it's not 100 it's 100 that's a lot of money in the day but if you're offering six or eight or nine percent the way you think about that 15 jump in the price it's great PR right because what do you see in the Wall Street Journal the next day XYZ company jumps on IPL what do you hope will happen other people read the story and what did they do they're gonna do they buy the momentum feeds itself and you hope the momentum will carry you forward so historically the reason or Founders and VCS have been okay with the discounting is they view it as kind of a you know sales leaders in retail stores we basically come in they're selling stuff at below cost they think are they will sell the lower price because we make it up later because we are actually not planning we can't even sell our shares for six months or a year we need the prices to keep going on so if you know the original studies for IPO has called it the IPO puzzle because you said how do founders accept it but that was built in the premise there are a hundred percent of the shares were offered when in fact only in five or ten percent incidentally that percentage that companies are offering on the on that first day of trading has dropped over time in the 1980s 40 to 50 percent now it's less than 10 so it's almost like they're doing the sampling of the shares rather than all of the change so the Alternatives have started to spring up I think the old time banking LED IPO is not long for this work just too inefficient and it's nothing I'm getting in return there's not enough service I'm getting in return for direct listings to it not unless you change the regulatory framework to allow direct listings to become more calm could spax do it maybe if I pay three percent okay Bill Ackman has his back as well very lowered the twenty percent to six percent because he said 20 people are not no that's a lot of money to leave on the table so maybe there's a version of a spec that I can accept where I might say three to four percent but somebody I can trust like a hedgehog think of it just is a very Advanced but saying these guys can now use my money to go like you know get involved in doing you know getting into companies on the ground floor so whatever it is that's the the there is change God so when we start the next class we're going to start on packet you know the last couple of pages of the fact that great packet three is real option so if you get a chance print off at least the first I think 139 say it's not as long as the last two packets so download that packet bring it with you foreign uh in one of the companies that somebody pitched in the Michael price fund it really caught my attention that they had negative working capital they had a huge famous I remember it might have been proctored them but one of these I have good terms for uh not pain disappointed yes so when the company grows uh working capital Works in favor of them um maybe even depending on how well or how bad we model capex uh your reinvestment might even be negative reinvestment in some of the models is that reasonable foreign end up looking like like the reinvestment is negative one and positive and the other but the bottom line is the pre-cash of the firm might be much more similar than you realize so I definitely wouldn't I I definitely shouldn't think about margins conversion to other competitors because you are adopting this risk and there's a risk to it right because as you use supply of credit I think even though it might not show up in the traditional Ravens [Music] often that's one of the red flags a lot of supply of credit and what if you don't you're not able to make those payments so your rating that you compare for the company basedness synthetic rating is much more questionable with the company which uses supplier credit or the company that has not it's in other words your true cost debt might be higher number because you're missing the fact that people lending to the company will actually be looking to supply credit that's what I'm saying this number is going to pay all this credit now I'm lined up to get money from that I'm going to charge a higher interest rate and there's a final component which is as companies scale up often companies in this smaller able to use a supply of credit you know Amazon will get started I think non-cash would you happen like minus 20 percent of Revenue there were a huge use of supply and benefits the way this would happen is they buy books from Publishers as an online bookmark but they only pay when they sell exactly they no they collected the cash but they're three months oh you have to pay the publisher they have negative uh operating sites it's a small company this was a huge item as Amazon scared up that minus twenty percent went to minus eighteen minus 15 minus seven minus three and now it's close to zero percent because at the scaling that they're at now it doesn't work you can't scale up so if you're doing non-cash working capitalist personal revenues it better get smaller over time and perhaps internal value start to disappear because you can't just build in this Everlasting stream oh so it I can't perpetuate such a scenario and even if it does it's coming at the expense of there has to be other reinvestments because all I did was let voting cap get more and more negative I'm not putting in any traditional netcap bets my investment capital is going to hit zero and keep going right yeah yeah exactly your balance sheet were not bad that's the bottom line right so if you think about hey your current liabilities you keep expanding my current assets State and I'm not investing in fixed assets if I keep projecting your balance sheet out at some point in time and very quickly my balance sheet is going to start to blow up so evaluation where there's non-cash working capital there's very little net cap back from the non-cash working capital is a negative number that gets more negative over time is a valuation that's built on balance sheets that don't balance and roic will go to them go to a high number and then it'll become negative yes Capital actually goes you know so you're building a company that internally is just waiting to grow up I'll tell you when you might get away with it if you have a lot of traditional net capex and you have a non-cash working capital that's negative and it's a small person of revenues because of your business model you know you might be a kind of business but you know you get paid up front but you don't pay the people that Supply you to labor it's possible you reduce your investment needs a little bit by using supplier credit to kind of you know but it's it's you still have a positive reinvestment right because those other ideas if you don't have that nice chat back so all you have is a negative working capital getting more negative over time in practice what's gonna blow the company up if this is the reality is that they're gonna have to pay at some point and uh in a moment of turmoil might not have cash yeah but I think also you'll have account itself what auditor is going to sign off on your balance sheet which doesn't balance some things happen yes because you're missing right because otherwise you're going to end up with liabilities I am but something else to offset it retained earnings that he said as well oh okay absolutely it's a computer number so yeah you want to know assets uh you told me not no net capex so the fixed assets are not growing so what are you adding on the asset side that keeps the balance sheet balance cash in the city on cash into really profitable to New York but then you think the library and putting in well you would have positive uh free cash flow and then you would sit at a scotch I guess so but then you found this one this weekend okay you'd have to leave it at zero because yeah because you're not Distributing so you can't do a discount cash flow model because in a discounted cash flow model you're Distributing yeah you're Distributing yeah somewhere or the other models breaking down yeah so it makes sense that's the question I would have when you have no net cap dates you have a big negative working capital that stays big and negative and gets more negative over the parents thank you they're a small little pre-revenue live for children nothing shorts there's a two-year Revenue growth process that should be very good and do that instead of um and I was going to try another multiple of all evidently resource size I can just get the same leaves what new videos exist such a scenario events like many other people such as an airplane is that different because they've given again repeatedly deliberately guarantee pure adverse towards person so easy to understand what advantages they discard because it makes their life easier because you guarantee the price easier to guarantee a low operation under that price so as we conclude that the only reason we need a bank to be an intermediate person is they can guarantee in that cells that's the only reason you said if you allow the bank to set up right you know it's like having the relatively guarantee the price could have mentioned the press the way they're getting prepared do they take whatever approaches an Oxford Clinic receptor guarantee the place they need a commission for the government of course everybody can set my house at 20 below the market so to me this is the least of these Services right this is not what you pay you're buying the banker the selling services the support services for the help they give you on the Prospectors to giving you recognition if you're a small company oh yeah that's true I see again it is that it doesn't have much value because I'll let you set the prices there yeah yeah yeah right 
recording in progress Ive very strange okay folks to teach you another one thing that you can't afford not to have with your voice and today I'm dangerously close to losing my voice so if I if I do start to falter I might have to go back and drink some tea or something down I think I can keep going so no this is actually a cold that worked its way through the system so good news is it's not cold but the bad news is my granddaughter whose birthday it was a week ago decided that she was going to share and she was very sharing you know so I did go to the baseball game but I don't scream at baseball games because I know I need my voice the next day so but but what I wanted to start this class by finishing up the very last piece of packet two but rather than go to packet two I was going to make it the start of the class cash so we've talked about private to private transactions right painful painful because you got to deal with lack of diversification and liquidity private to public you're celebrating it's very much like a public company private IPO a few twists but you valued like a public company but didn't have to worry about you know what you do with the offering proceeds those options that I hang over I want to finish by looking at a private to public transaction that's a little more involved so let's say you're the founder of a company and you have big plans so right now you want to start the company you're already thinking about going public so that's how much potentially think good plan is for the next couple of years you expect to have enough Capital to keep this company going you're completely undiversified you're going to be locked into the company so let's say that the beta for the business you're in is one and the correlation the typical companies let's say your software company they aren't 11 pages one your correlation the correlation of a typical software company the market is 0.25 you're completely undiversified let me pause right there you're the founder you're completely undiversified you look at this company you don't see a beta one right because you're exposed to all the risk you see a beta of four essentially you see four times as much risk because everything you own is tied up in the company but the way you see this going is two years from now you plan to go to Adventure capitals the venture capitalist is not Diversified either but they're spread out across 30 software companies what does that give them it gives them some of the benefits of diversification because a software sector overall has a higher correlation than individual software companies why because you know what you have is company specific risk starts to average out there so let's say the correlation with the market that you get for the software group as a whole at the Venture Capital whether venture capital is 0.5 same company same on level beta but now the marginal investors walking in and their beta that they will see will not be the four that the founder did or the one that the fully Diversified investor debate they're going to see in this company is two which effectively lowers the cost of equity for the company so for the first two years it's a Founder's money it's you know a total made of four a high cost of equity then the VC comes in and provides Capital they're a little more Diversified that pushes the cost of equity down and then you get to your five things go as planned what do you plan to do you go to you you go public who's buying your shares investors are they Diversified you don't care it's their choice if they choose not to be Diversified it's their prom but your investors are Diversified the beta they're going to see in this company is going to back to being one same company different costs of equity as you go through time you see how to Value this company now you've got to use different costs of equity the cost of equity that I've estimated here 24 for the first two years reflects the fact that it's your money tied up that it's 14 for the next three years because the venture capitalist is accepting a lower cost of equity they're now the marginal investors and then you go public it's the invest Diversified investor debate is lowered the cost of equity so here's how it plays out your terminal value will be computed based on the nine percent cost of equity because that's when you go public the 14 will be the discount rate when the VC is the marginal investor 24 will be the discount rate when the founder is the investor discount in the cash flows just became a huge pain in the neck why because you can't use the present value function in Excel anymore your cost of equities are changing over time so you notice that I do something that I always do in my valuation which is to compute this accumulated cost of equity what does it allow you to do it allows you to reflect the fact that your discount rate is changing over time and you take that cumulated cost of equity that is what I'm going to use from a present value factor using that correct cumulated cost of equity the value of the firm that I get is 1.5 million or 1.5 billion depending on how much you want to scan it down you're saying couldn't I have just use the present value function how different would have my answer been if you if you use the cost of equity that basically did not you didn't use accumulated cost of equity as the present value function the value that you would get here would be higher by about 300 million dollars because you're essentially mismatching the cash flows the discount rates if you use a 24 discount rate is your cost of equity forever you're going to just destroy the value value is going to be much lower so using a nine percent cost of equity is going to give you too high a value why the reason you're getting in the middle is you have to live through those five years of no impartial diversification to get to that point of diversification now what will happen if I can shrink that window if I say I can go public in three years then I'm going to have less of a diversification penalty to pay right what if the VCS are entering in year three are more Diversified than I thought they were it's again going to reduce the diversification the consequence the discard your reply but there was much talk about the gray Market that was created in the last decade by public market investors entering the VC space the T row prices the Fidelity is coming in and acquiring Stakes of uber and other young companies what that effectively meant that every startup benefited from that Trend because when you value a startup now instead of assuming that the marginal investor in a year or two would be a VC was not that Diversified you now have somebody's equivalent of a public market investor you've actually removed many of the incentives to go public in the first place right because one of the reasons companies went public in the old day in the is because that's the only way you could unlock that diversification effect now I think you can stay private get Diversified investors effectively get almost the same value same value that you'd have got as a public company which is one reason if you look at companies going public now they're older by almost a decade that companies that went public 30 years ago typically companies used to go public four five six years into their lives now they wait till they're 13 14 15 years because you can afford to wait the cost of waiting have become smaller now there's a social cost by allowing private companies to be valued like public companies without the public disclosure requirements of public companies or the corporate governance requirements of public companies we are asking for some surprises and that's I think the downside of this development we've seen in BC markets or public Equity investors any questions yeah so I'm going to start on real options but you know before I jump into excuse me before I jump into real options I want to do a very quick review of basic option pricing I know you understand the black shows the binomial all that stuff but I will assume you remember nothing so I'm going to take you through about a 30 minute review of basic option pricing because to talk about real options without talking about the basics of option pricing is introducing a tool that requires some understanding before you so let's start by looking at the basis for why real options have become such a Hot Topic in corporate finance evaluation for as long as I know people have always looked for a way to justify paying a premium an optionality gives you an argument for doing it in fact this has become a word that people throw as a buzzword no you do a net present value of a project and it's negative you say don't take the project but the managing director says but there's optionality there you find a stock that is overvalued you say I don't want to buy the stock but there's optionality there especially with platform companies this became the vehicle that people used to say let's buy a big platform it doesn't make any sense but we get optionality so today I want to give you some questions you can ask to decide when it makes sense to use the option idea argument and when it does but here's what the optionality argument at its core looks at it looks at the fact that when you do a traditional investment analysis evaluation here's what you do you take the information you have today you estimate expected cash flows you discount them back at a risk adjusted discount rate based on what you know today that's all I can ask you to do right and you come up with a value to it you're saying what else can I do what you're not factoring in is sometimes there can be options that you're missing here here's one of the first when you do a traditional Capital budgeting analysis you get the present value the cash flows they're less than the initial investment your net present value is negative what's the conclusion you draw bad project don't take the project that's still true but having the rights to this bad project could it be worth something absolutely because we can delay taking this project it might be a time in the future when this project could become viable it's called the option to delay I'm going to use that as the on trip to talk about why a non-viable technology might be value so let's say I come to you with this great AI technology extraordinarily expensive right now doesn't make sense to develop it my guess is I'll have people buying the technology from me because if they can make the right changes it could be an incredibly lucrative technology it's the option to delay the second option is an even more dangerous one I come to you with a bad project you're saying why would I take a bad project because it gives you the rights to an even worse project in the future this is going from bad to worse right to give you a bad project with the right towards project but the second project you get to pick whether to take it or not I'm going to argue there will be cases where you will take a bad project because you can see the right to expand or do something in a much bigger Market that right now it doesn't make sense but if it did could be looking that's your option to expect the third is once you make an investment especially if it's a long-term investment and it's a very expensive investment one of your concerns is what if things go wrong having the option to be able to walk away from those Investments if things are going wrong early in its life so let's say to a 50-year investment but you're able to walk away in your three or four or five even with a fraction of what you originally invested might be something that might be a value to you because you're not stuck with this investment for the next 45 years it's the option to abandon and all of these options essentially play out in your final decision making that's what that's at the core of the real options argument so let me give you a very simple decision tree example of how optionality can change decisions so here you have two branches 50 50 chance the 50 chance of making a hundred million a 50 chance of losing 120. what's the expected value I understand right don't take the project I'm going to take this decision tree and break it up into two branches so the initial branch is a 75 chance you make 20 million and a 25 chance you will lose 20 million if you lose 20 million that first try you'll stop if you make 20 million there's a two-thirds chance you will get 90 million additional value and a one-third chance that you will lose 100 million listen what's this got to do with the previous example if you look at the total losses I have minus 120 and the total upside what plus 100 looks very similar in terms of upside and downside if you take the cumulative probabilities of success and failure it looks like I'm 50 chance of upside and a 50 chance of downside but if you get a chance work through the expected value of this decision tree and it magically turns positive so what is it about the second decision tree that makes a bad project into a good project what am I getting to do in that second decision tree just drop early on first is I get to observe first I do a small it's almost like a test right I observe the outcome of the test and what do I do I modify my decision based on what I see so I observed it the outcome and then I say look if I get a bad outcome on that first test I stop and if I get a good outcome I continue at the core of the real options argument are two components one is that you get to observe something out there that tells you whether your project is going to be successful and then you adapt your behavior based on what you've observed one of the things we're going to talk about today is why when you value a traditional natural resource company you tend to undervalue it is because of this optionality and here's what let's suppose I I ask you the value in Oil Company what do you do you project out the expected barrels of oil they'll produce the expected oil price you get an expected revenue is expected cash flow you're discounted back at a risk-adjusted discontract you come up with the value today that's all you can do right but think about your expected production and the expected oil price you had to do right now you don't know what it is but if you are an oil company what do you get to observe at the end of year one at the end of year two you get to observe the oil price and After You observe the oil price you can change how much you produce based on the oil price that's the optionality you're missing in a traditional discounted cash flow model is you get to observe something and change your behavior based on that and that's what drives that extra premium you're willing to pay but so as I said it's a it's a very dangerous door we've opened because we've we've in a sense taken a first principle I've called my corporate finance class in the capital budgeting section we talk about Net Present Value Net Present Value is negative don't take the project in valuation so far we said value to companies but it's less than the price don't buy the stock I'm going to open the door to violating that rule and I want to make sure it doesn't get opened all the time because otherwise you're going to be overriding your Net Present Value overriding evaluation and doing things anywhere so the three basic questions that you need to ask an answer before you decide to use the real options argument first is you first have to decide whether there's an option embedded in an action in a decision so we'll talk about what is it that makes for an option second when does that option of significant economic value because if it doesn't then we're talking about something that's abstract if it's worth two cents who cares if it were two billion obviously okay we'll talk about what is it that drives the value of an option and third when does that when can I estimate that value using an option pricing model so let's start with the first of those questions what is it that makes an option an option anybody want to help me out here what are the things that ingredients you look for to make an option an option it's it's not it's not a it's a right it's not a requirement right you get the choice so that's good what else it's a derivative asset which means there has to be an underlying asset so if you tell me there's an option the first question I'm going to ask is what is the underlying asset if you don't have an answer then I'm not sure I trust you when you say there's an option there's an underlying asset I get the right to buy that asset at a fixed price in a call option the right to sell that asset at a fixed price in a put option but it's a right it's not an obligation I choose to exercise that right and the way this of course pays out isn't that picture that basically sets options apart from every other asset out there which is the payoff diagram I showed it to you early in the class but might as well show it again the essence of options is you get limited downside because it's an it's it's a right not an obligation you you cannot be forced to exercise an option so you all you lose is what he paid for the option and potentially unlimited upside in a call option why because who knows what the price can go to so that's the first feature of options limited downside unlimited upside if you have a put option it just flips the diagram around you have limited downside still I want to unlimited upside because your price can't go below zero but there is a lot of upside so the essence of options is this payoff diagram one of the things you're going to see me do with every real option I introduce I'm going to talk about patents as options undeveloped oil reserves as options is with each one I'm going to show you the payoff diagram that I have I'm going to tell you what my underlying asset is and what that contingency is the contingency is where you get that you know whether you get the graph turning that drives the optionality so that's the first step is to make sure that what you're looking at is in fact an option Second Step does this option have significant economic value I'm going to introduce a word into your Lexicon that you should use you have surrounded by people who keep start keep talking about optionality the word is exclusivity without exclusivity there is no option value what I mean by that I said do you get the right to buy something at a price right if only you have the right you have an option if everybody has that right that's not an option the option value very quickly dissipates in a traditional call or a put option on the listed stock that exclusivity comes in the contract it's if you can buy it at fifty dollars but when we talk about real options this becomes a very critical question to us because in my view a lot of people mistake opportunities or options yes [Music] it depends on the industry for a couple of reasons one is in some Industries first movers might have such an advantage that once you've moved here it becomes impossible for somebody else to come in so in those Industries You could argue there is an optionality being that first mover because even if you lose money getting there once you're there you're the ruler of everything you see you've set the terms so in many technology businesses were first movers have essentially become these big Winners there is that optionality argument it could also be that in an industry there are government licenses and regulations and if you get to be the company that gets that approval then other companies can't come up but it all goes back to Hey What Can competitors do but what what do I have the exclusive right to do okay so if you decide there is a value to the option we know conclusively what drives the value of an option I can say it I don't we don't know what conclusively what drives the value of a stock there are too many variables we don't know but with options we know conclusively why because options are leeches they derive their value from something else the value of an option is determined by six variables and let me list out the six three relay to the underlying asset the first is the value of the underlying asset as the value of the underlying asset goes up and down the values of all options tied to it will also go up and down remember what I said you get the right to buy something at a fixed price if that something goes up in value by 20 percent the right to buy it became more valuable because you have a fixed price so the value of the underlying asset goes up calls will become more valuable puts will get less value second the variance in that value becomes a driver of the value of your options and this is where options exercise they're different from every other asset class every other type of asset no but this kind of cash flow evaluation of pricing as risk went up value went down with options as risk goes up value goes up and it goes back very simply to that downside protection you've got risk becomes your ally so the more uncertainty there is about the underlying asset the more valuable all our options become on it third any expected dividends that that asset pays will affect the value of your option why is that I mean take in terms of stock yeah price of a stock goes down by roughly the dividend on the ex-dividend there why because cash leaves the company the business rates that can be generalized in any kind of acid when the asset pays a dividend the value of the asset will go down so when you're valuing an option on an asset and you expect dividends on the asset for the next three four five years the more dividends you expect the lower the value of the option will be because you can see that X dividend day Behavior play out every three months for the next four or five years so value the asset matters the variance in that value matters the dividends the asset matter you turn to the option itself there are two characteristics the option to drive it Value First is the strike price and you can see why I said a call gives you the right to buy something at a fixed price would you like that right at a lower price or a higher price the lower the price the more valuable the option right so if I give you the right to buy something at ten dollars it's worth more than the right to buy the same thing at twenty dollars the case of a foot option the reverse is going to be true because you got the right to sell at that price so the exercise price matters and how much time you have to play the game also matters the longer the time I let you have this right the more valuable the ride becomes do it so we've got up to five variables there's only one macro variable in here it's a riskless rate why the risk list rate because in an option you get the right to buy something at a fixed price in the future right a year from now you got to pay a million dollars but you have a year before you pay the million dollars if interest rates are three percent present value of a million is pretty close to still a million right nine ninety six thousand but if interest rates are fifty percent that one million you got to pay a year from now is worth a lot less so when when you have risk riskless rates go up the value of call options will tend to increase because that exercise price in today's terms becomes less onerous less expensive put options you receive money a year two years from now the higher the risk-free rate becomes the lower the value what you're going to receive so put options are affected negatively that's it those are the six variables so is there an option is there exclusivity in which case the values which brings us to the final question which is can I value this option using an option pricing model an option pricing models can be incredibly messy in terms of mathematics but let me give you a little bit of History prior to 1971 the way people valued options is they did probabilities and estimate what the option be what the stock went to a certain number Paul Samuelson had one of the first option pricing model the 60s incredibly complicated so it looked like you're wearing a stock every single outcome take an expected value in 1971 Fisher black and Martin shows kind of revolutionized option pricing by noting something which I I think at that point in time had not been clarified which is you can create something exactly like an option you're saying what do you mean you take an option that is expected cash flows right with every outcome you can create what's called a replicating portfolio a portfolio composed of the underlying asset and either borrowing a lending that is exactly the same cash flows as the option so you want to buy a call option I can create a portfolio composed of the stock and borrowing that looks exactly like a call option it's called a replicating portfolio in fact every option pricing model is a search for that replicating portfolio because once you find the replicating portfolio the second leg of the argument kicks in so you now have an option and a replicating portfolio they have exactly the same cash flows the second argument is arbitrage what does that mean the two have to be priced at exactly the same price because if they're not priced at the same price you'll Arbitrage why because you buy the cheaper one you sell the more expensive one you claim the difference today and because their cash flows offset each other there's no risk of cash flows in the future every option pricing model is built on replication and Arbitrage but think of what you need to do replication you need to be able to trade the underlying asset you need to be able to borrow and lend at the risk-free rate the bar and lender the risk-free rate we can dance around and get close enough but can you always trade the underlying acid if I buy call option in IBM can I trade the underlying asset yeah IBM is a traded stock but I said I'm going to think of patents as as an option what's your underlying acid I have a patent on a drug the underlying asset is the drug that will emerge from it and the cash flows that will come from developing the drug right it's not a tradable asset one of the things we're going to very quickly run into with real options is you can take option pricing models you can come up with the value for a real option but you can have a far less confidence in that number than you do with listed options because you cannot replicate the option and you cannot do Arbitrage so with that with with those concerns let's very quickly spend a little very quickly spend some time on you know how you create this replicating portfolio and how it plays out in option pricing models I said whatever option you have I can create a portfolio of the underlying asset and a riskless asset that creates exactly the same cash flows as the option with the call option I'll borrow the money and buy Delta shares of you're saying what's Delta that's going to be something I'm going to very quickly go through but that's what an option pricing monetizer how many shares of the underlying stock do I need to drive if I'm buying a put you sell short on the underlying asset and you lend out the money so effectively you can replicate any option using the underlying as so let's talk about this replica you perform the easiest way to see this is actually by using what's called a binomial plot a binomial model comes with limits which is at any point in time your price can go only one or two cards okay so let's take a stop it's trading at 50 right now in the next time period it can either go to 70 or 35. at t equal to one if it goes to 17 the next time that it can go to other 100 or 50. it goes to 35 can jump to 50 or 25. so the end of two periods this stock can be at 150 or 25. let's suppose I come to you the call option today with a strike price of 40. so you don't know what's going to happen all you know is the price today is 50. I come with this with a call out to the strike price report let's let's look at what the cash flows on this call will be at the very end no because that's the only note where you know exactly so this is the call option that expires at t equal to two so your call option you get the right to buy the stock and portrait if the stock goes to 100 are you going to exercise it right yeah you're going to put in the trash cans I wish I hadn't done that but you know of course still there but let's look at this and gross cash flows so your cash flows will be 60 10 and zero at the end this is what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to try to create the combination of borrowing and buying the underlying stock that will be exactly the same cash flows as so let's start at t equal to one stock price is everything I want to buy certain so let's call the Delta call these shares of stock and I'm going to borrow B dots I know there are two unknowns in this and what do I want that combination to do I want you to create a cash flow of 60 the stock goes to 100. so whatever I bought buy at the stock price of 70. and uh whatever I bought on the net cash flow has to be 60 the stock price goes 200. if the stock price goes to 250 I want 50 times the E minus 1.11 times B with 11 of the interest rate to be 10. so essentially what I've done is I've taken D and B they're unknowns I know for the moment I'm giving you the interest rates that I want those to be set in a way that I get exactly the same cash Brokers at all I know this is throwing you back way back in time but remember you've got two equations and two unknowns you work long enough and odd enough there should be no unknowns so you can solve for this so basically what I'm doing is solving for D and B and I get D equal to 1 and b equal to 36 whatever so what does it even mean if the stock price goes to seven because what I'm going to do I'm going to go ahead and borrow 36 dollars in four cents and buy one share of stuff that position will have exactly the same cash flow qualific 100 that position referred to 160 if the stock goes to 50 the position is going to be worth it so I've created a replicating portfolio at least for the moment with the stock is 70 it's going to be composed of borrowing 36 dollars in buying one channel stock if the stock goes to 35 and repeat the process 50 times D minus 1.11 times V has to be equal to 10 25 times 3 minus 1.11 B is equal to zero I solve for D and B and here's what I said I borrow nine dollars and one cent and I buy 0.4 shares of stock earning less than how you buy point four I assume you can I get exactly the same cash flow replicated the call at least they're different portfolios depending on what the stock was 70 or 75 but I've created a combination of borrowing and the underlying stock that is the same cap and of course I can ask you if you work out what it costs you to do this it basically in it at you know one dollar stock is going to cost me seventy dollars I borrowed thirty six dollars and four cents I have to come up to 33.96 stock close to 70 and have to come up with 4.99 in other words I'm telling you what the value of the call has to be at those points in time to give you exactly the same cash flows now let's go back to zero you can already see why with the binomial model you've got to start with the very end of the tree and work backwards to the very end of the trees the only time you know exactly what your cash flows are to what what period is that in this case I've got my T1 packets I go to t equal to zero I repeat the process I want to buy shares now and I want the value of my shares to be worth 33.96 the stock goes to 70 and 4.99 the stock goes to 35. so that's 70 times T minus 1.115 3396. 35 times 3 minus 1.11 B let's go to 4.99 I solve for D and B and if I borrow 21.61 today and 5.82 seven eight shares of stock today I get to put 40 that not only is a replicating portfolio today but it's going to cover all of my needs for the rest of the of the tree which is so with the 70 and fully covered the stock which is 35 and fully covered I've essentially created a replicating portfolio the value of the car that I get from that is 19.42 cents replicating portfolios that's what I've computed Arbitrage I'm assuming that they have the same time the binomial model was not the first model black trolls model came up the binomial model was developed partly because you know I think teachers were trying to teach the black shows that were really difficult I'm explaining where in the black shows you were doing the replication is a trust that this replication I don't see it so I think in 1970s Mark Rubinstein was teaching at UC Berkeley then came up with this way of saying this is what replication looks like if you're hired up on a little more but the binomial March comes its own limits right at any point you can have only two points that the stock can go to so for for this model even at the slightest chance of working you need to make time really sure second one minute so think of drawing a binomial tree with one minute time intervals for a three-month option it's already making this thinking about that tree right first you're going to get a really sharp pencil a really big paper and start drawing tiny little breaths so you want that kind of patience and you fit in every single branch so you're now done right you've got this immense biometry how many how many minutes are there in three months I have no idea I have no idea but it's a lot of minutes but you put them on take a look at that paper and then shift it side so basically you brought this tree it looks like a triangle right smooth out the outside of the triangle what does it look like what what statistical distribution even an over distribution you take the binomial model and as you make time really short in this case a minute second you keep price changes continuous basically that means the price is moving tiny little increments the binomial distribution converges on the normal distribution so what you end up with is a normal distribution without all of the work of having to specify those individual price numbers for thousands and thousands of brands but there is a chance that you could be wrong right can prices move by large amounts and short periods the black shows Mark does not allow for discontinuous person it's one of the limitations of the model it's built on this premise of things move gradually the way you get from thirty dollars to fifty dollars in the black sort of world you can go 30 30 or 130 or 230 or three you don't jump from 30 to 50 because otherwise the normal distribution that's like so it's nice to have the normal distribution it's convenient but it comes at that cost so if you look at the black shoals model the black shoals model is a limiting case of the binomial model if you assume that is price change or time becomes short the price changes become continuous so the original black shorts model 1971 it took Fisher black and modern shows almost two years to actually finish the model we'll talk about what what crimp did years later for it and in the original black show of Marty there were five inputs that drove the value of the metal of an option the stock price s the strike price k would be the length of life of the option R is the riskless rate for whatever reason Microsoft Office seem to be changing my Mac or sigmas to question mark so that's a sigma the variance first s k t r n the variance but what are the six variables I think you're missing variable what is the sixth variable that I listed out just a few minutes about driving them out of an option value the I set the variance and the value of the life of the auction is that evidence there are no evidence anymore you wouldn't know the honest reason why because dividends were so messy to build in mathematically and that finally that controls throughout the energy exactly you know what we're going to assume away difference the original Black Shoals was designed to valuable are called dividend protected options you're saying how many dividend protected option work remember I said if you have an option one of the things you worry about stock price drops when they live in this type in a dividend protected option the strike price also it's low right to reflect it are there any dividend protected options in the world none that I know of but it made their solution much simpler so they assumed a way difference yes in Brazil there so dividend protected options so but maybe the original black shows what's better on those option would be an interesting test but much of the word kind of dividend protection so keep that in mind when I show you the black Charles model and remember all the question marks and segments so don't put in question marks in your final exams everything professor Professor yes am I not sharing we're not we're not hearing we're not hearing you very well or seeing the slides online let's see let me try that again can you see the slides now yes we see black shoals model I'll try and uh my my the reason you might not be hearing me is my voice is not that great but no maybe the mic will have so the original bike shows and you've all seen this in some version or another in different class here's what drives the value columns s which is the value of the stock today does nd1 we'll talk about what that is a cumulative you know area under the normal distribution minus K which is the strike price e minus RT notice how the black shorts makes you use all those buttons and the calculator you can never touched a natural log that credentials what e minus what is he is present value he said why don't they just use one plus r raised to the power D which is what we do when we do present value because we're working in continuous time that one plus r raised to the power of T which is what we do for traditional pressure values so e minus RT is the present value why because you don't need to pay the strike price until two or three or whenever the option comes so the current stock price times nfd1 minus the present value the strike price times we should put C1 and B2 D1 and D2 are a function of all of those variables we talked about skrtm that's what took them two years to get to all of the is to get the D1 and D2 but they built a effect of all of the variables at least this is solid gravity option now as you look at this you're saying where's the replication where's the Arbitrage I think when people use the black shorts they're so busy getting an output that they don't stop and look at what the lactose is actually but embedded in the black tones is a replicated performance to replicate this call here's what you need to do you need to go out and borrow k e minus r k e minus RT times nb2 that's your borrowing and by nd1 shares of stock the nd1 shares is called the option depth option Traders is you know a very 400 degree path Delta gamma Theta everything in the option lingo is built around the traffic input forces but it's if the stock price changes from the option that's the change that's called the option the option Gap what are the standard deviation changes well of course I don't think any importance it's called the option Vega everything that option Traders are talking about is something to do with the replicating because it's at the heart of option price in fact it's harder how you hatch options right if I have a big option position to ask you to hedge it you have to create the replicating portfolio in the other side and hope you did it right because if you didn't do it right it's going to blow up in my face the black Schultz model gives you a measure of what that replicating portfolio would look like now your final question is let's say I've got the D1 and D2 and what exactly is this the end of D1 and end of B2 if you're taking a statistics classes usually a normal distribution at the end of your statistics of textbook that distribution will be the height and the distribution at different components in the distribution n of B1 is the area under the distribution it's a standardized normal distribution what does that mean the lowest value n of D can take is zero the highest value it can take is one zero to one you know what the intuitive way to think of n of B1 and nfp2 is it's a probable if you go back to the previous page say bye enemy one that's the number of shares but it's also a rough estimate of the probability in this case the end of the two turns out to be better by the asthma that your option will actually end up in the money so if you have a depart the money option you should expect for the end of D1 and NFD to be to be low numbers no between zero and one and the closer your option becomes becoming a sure thing the end of D1 and nfd2 are going to drift up towards one so rather than think of them as statistical artifacts you're plugging in think of them as probabilities and your option will be in the money or other than so that's the lead-in and in case you're wondering about dividends because we have to deal with dividends in many real options there's a version of the black shows that exists where you would we can adjust it and in this model here's all you do you have to make an assumption that the dividend yield stays constant over the life of the auction that's the easiest way to do it so let's say your dividend deal is two percent the modifications are pretty intuitive what happens to D1 and D2 will reflect the fact that I now have dividends that I collect remember the replicating portfolio I bought the underlying stock and I borrowed money I'm now collecting dividends on the stock and using to base some of the interests it reduces my carrying cost to the option and by doing so it does affect the value for an option so actually the version of black shorts we will be using more in the context of adding real options in this one with the dividend unit is going to be an optional so let's summarize when you look at an option you're looking at is there an option is there is there value to the option and finally you're asking can I use an option pricing model option pricing model it's called the whole architecture of assumption when we can get them going they're actually among the most precise models you will run into because they if you keep the underlying asset is your base your value everything against that underlined as you don't have to know the revenue growth margins none of that stuff that affects the value of the underlying asset the option to rise inside so I if you look at there's one small catch if you use the black shows more the black shorts model is designed to Value what are called European options it's an unfortunate choice of them because it says something to do with geography there's nothing right European options can be exercised only at expiration but real options get exercising with listed options you can see why people use the black shorts 97 of listed options get held to mature why because you always make more money by selling to somebody else in the market rather than holding up we talked about this in the context of employee options as well in the case of real large you know I talk about a patent as an option what is exercise I mean converting the package to a commercial truck do you want to do that I would think so that's the end game of success right so with a patent you want to develop well before the end of the 18th year whenever your product runs up in the 30 or the fifth year or the exercise you have undeveloped all reserves as an option you want to develop the results I would think so well before the end date where you can't develop them anymore real options almost by definition will get exercise early and why don't you push facts you will get when you use black shows or any you know black trolls mods value real options is how come you're using a European option pricing model to Value what I'm purely ever active options technically they're right but if you wanted to decide to go with a binomial option pricing model which can deal with early exercise what do I need to do I need to draw oil prices on a minute five minute basis for the next 10 years not even next three months because the reserve might last 10 years I can't do that I'd much rather get an estimate of value from a black shows model and remember it's going to be a conservative investment because the European option is the low end of the West the capacity about exercises it will only make the optional value better to get an estimate that doesn't require so much work that you give up on doing it than to go for an estimate that's going to be so much out of the reach because you can't use it now it just as a as a result you know often people bring out option pricing they're bringing on the big ammunition right because option pricing intimidates people it scares them and one of my suggestions when somebody called me and says can I use an option pricing model to present to managers you know what the payoffs your heart's pharmaceutical company I said have you tried a decision tree first it's a much more low-tech way of bringing in these choices you have at different cities you've seen decision trees there we have drugs you're developing you can look at test one you know stage one stage two stage three the property of success and this is an example is a decision trick where should I test should if I succeed what happens at each stage you're drawing all of the problem possible outcomes and here you can actually have more than more than unlike a binomial we already two choices you can have four branches three branches the difference is you have to attach probabilities to the bank if you're willing to draw a full decision and it's what I know it's fine it takes tremendous amounts of information and attach properties you can get an expected value from a decision tree that matches the value that I've got from using an options but it's much more in tune it's probabilistic rather than say trust me or replicating portfolios and Arbitrage which might be completely foreign Concepts so try something low-tech but you can if you can convince people with a decision Tree on what the payoffs here are of thinking about the choices any questions about the mechanics of option pricing yes the party that comes out of the decision tree in a business it's 50 but things are either 100 or zero whilst you can value it at 50. in reality the downside is so significant to your business operations in a way I guess you're not Diversified across lots of different decisions is that that's why it's not quite an expected value once you get past it better I use that very simple decision tree to kind of start the process an option pricing model is actually a risk in general because remember the underlying action is already risk adjusted to that so if I have you know computer president cash flows from developing the patent into a drug I bring in my worries into a cost per capita and Computing the customer so now I have the present value it's lower than what I think will cost me to develop the drug it's a negative network but that negative Net Present Value is already risk adjustment all the option pricing is trying to do is what if in the future the present value of my risk adjusted cash flows exceeds my initial investment so the risk is already factored into the option pricing but what it's also bringing in is all of the different outcomes that can happen as the president that's why it uncertainty matters because if you're certain about the present value today and it's less than the initial investment there is no option now you can turn the project downtown that it's because you're uncertain about how this product could evolve in the future if you add that premium so it's going to be three basic tests whatever you run into somebody using an option is there an option embed in the ass draw the payoff diagram there's an option second is there exclusivity if there is there's value to the option if there isn't be very careful and third can I use an option pricing model to Value this option and for that you need replication or objects can I trade the underlying asset then I trade the option the option itself needs to be traded as well I'm not sure how you trade exactly you can sell it to another company but it's not as if there's a market for options but every real option I'm going to end with this question because it's going to tell you how much we're stretching what is actually a very powerful technology to Value Financial assets into value realizations so let's start with options and projects and addresses in a traditional way we've been taught to look at projects is thank you cash flows compared to this investment come up with an fpv it's negative it's a bad project it's positive it's a good project but as I said there are three things we ignore when we do this first is that a project that's a bad project today could become a good project tomorrow or a year from now three years from now so the rights to a bad project can actually be about sounds contradictory but the rights to a bad project the non-viable technology can be done second I'm going to talk about the option to delay which is you take a bad investment knowing it's a bad investment going into the Open Eyes but you think it will open the doors to much bigger potential opportunities in the future with potentially higher mid-classic example is companies that went into China and China first opened up knowing they would lose money early on but say it's a big Market and if that initial investment pays off think of how much money like your option to expect and third is the option to ban which is a really long term investment being able to walk away from your Investments it's a great deal of homage being paid to be flexible as a company now especially in the aftermath Corvette and the companies that are flexible have an advantage and I think they do the option to abandon actually is a measure how much flexibility have you built in demand of being able to walk over yourself right a lot of the technology disruptors that have come up in the last decade have built themselves on being more flexible than their status quo this gives you a great way of value how much it options go and these options all have value and they could potentially take an investment that is a negative Net Present Value and make it into investment that you would take anywhere because of these options so let's start with the options for that for the option to delay argument to even get started you have to have an exclusive rut to do something an exclusive right to take across so let's say you have an exclusive ride that exclusive right today if you developed it might have a negative difference in time the project can change over time right now technology can take the market can change the next person that it can go from being negative deposit so as I said every real option I'm going to talk about I'm going to introduce with a chaos right so here's what the payoff diagram looks like for the option yeah the exclusive rights to take the project what does exercise mean you will have to make the investment to take the process that becomes a strike price it's a right not an obligation under what condition should we make the investment is the present value of the expected cash flows exceeds that the mission investment so right now you're the exclusive right it's not viable right now the president cash flows is less leadership investment but you have three four five ten years if the president cash flows rise is enough you will take the investment and claim the difference so the option to delay it comes from the fact that the net present value of the months negative now could become positive I'm going to use this is the options it lays set up to look at two aspects of investing one is the valuable pet which I think can be trade very simply as an option to delay and the other is the value undeveloped resources the oil oil gold whatever you have and value again as an option so let's start with valuing a patent what do you get with the patent you get the exclusive right to check off the exclusively box right unless you're in a country where your passion is not protected by by legal Authority for the courts you have an exclusive for how long again it varies across countries 18 years 20 years but let's say you're the exclusive right for the next 18 years so what to develop the fact if you mess around what will happen if you choose to develop the fact you have to invest something to get the passion to do let's call what you invest on not being particularly created so that's what will cost you to develop ment billion dollars too bad whatever it is and let's say the present value of the cash flows you will get if you develop the patent today because that's all you can tell you can't tell me what's in the future so I is what you need to invest to develop the patent B is the present value the expected cash flows from developing class if it's B is greater than I you will develop the fact it's in the money option if B is less than I what will you do wait hope that something could happen like if you drew this as a as a payout diagram the cost to converting the patent into a product becomes the equivalent of the strength right the present value of the cash flows from the drug or whatever else that you can that comes out of the pattern would become the equivalent of the stock price the life of the patent becomes the life of the option what's a variety what am I looking at what's my underlying acid the drug or product that comes out of the pack right today I've been expected set of cash flows in the present value am I certain about them not in the least the uncertainty in those cash flows the variance and those cash in that present value is what I mean you think where am I going to find that this is not a trade stock I'll give you a couple of ways you can perhaps get that number but that variance is what's driving the value of results so if I were to list out the variables the value of the underlying assets and Present Value the cash flows and while you're doing this you know the constant complaint you're gonna have is but but in my responses good you see what is the value of an option come from one of the few cases where being uncertain actually works in your favor the more uncertain you are the more you should think about optionality foreign second stop you're going to say well can I estimate how much uncertainty there is whether one is the easy the easiest talk to the AI space and say Market must know something I use that standard information the other is look what we did Monte Carlo simulations we got an expected value we did this with Disney for everything with um how do you push share that I got a standard deviation that value I could do the same thing on a project basis I could compute the net present value of the project which is negative right now but give you a standard deviation the exercise pricing the option is what it will cost you to actually develop your patent into a commercial truck the life of the option is whenever the auction will become the life of the path and there's one final ingredient I'm going to put in if I'll stop right there s-k-r-p and sigma the value of the option will always be greater than the exercise makes sense right if you have listed option that's what we do so we set it so there's a time period of the option I need to introduce a variable here that will cause you to exercise because as I said if you sit at every option the very last day of it uh to the fact expires even the sense lost the value of the option so every year you wait after an option becomes viable you're giving up something you have 17 years left in the back part of me says let's develop right away it's a viable option but somebody says but let's wait here let's collect more information would that be helpful absolutely you get a better product maybe a better sense of the market price it better but there is a price you pay for waiting right what do you give up one year of protection from competition does it cost to delay that cost of delay is what I capture here by saying look once you get viable you and you decide to wait it's going to cost you one out of the remaining 17 years or 16 it's kind of a shortcut that's basically what you're losing by waiting what will happen to that cost is I go from 17 years to 16 to 15 the cost to delay is going to rise every year you see why 170 is going to become 1 16 then 115 which means I'm plotting you constantly once a patent becomes interesting are you developing now are you developing that because you keep putting it off too long you're giving up too much of that protection that is the whole point of getting the practice so I'm going to try this on an actual drug and one of the reasons I was able to do this is actually able to get my hands on an actual cash flow analysis that buyer just had done on a drug called abinos it's now in the market now but if this was in late 90s they developed the drug it's for MS president they are just you know filed the patent at 17 years of protection they're the only ones for development they haven't developed it yet so what I'm going to try to do is assess whether they should develop hypernex right away whether they should wait whether there's a value so let's compute the X as is the president I need to cash flows now when you've seen how quality hookup companies compute cash flows in a drug it's actually a scary exercise because here's how it will go start with the percentage of the population that has MS then look at what percentage of those people actually go to a doctor it's not a hundred percent they're the percent that go to a doctor they look at the percentage that actually get the right diagnosis and it's not a hundred percent and among the people who get the right diagnosis look at the percentage you can actually afford the treatment not 100 so you start off with three million people with Ms by the time you do these touches down to cash flows and that's what they used to come up with a 3.4 computer at the time that I did this analysis why you can have never developed a drug on their own two other drugs they developed but they sold them off to other former companies then it's a minority operation but this drug they want to develop on their own and they estimated that it would cost them about 2.9 billion dollars to set up the infrastructure to actually develop and sell the cup 2.85 so let me pause right there 2.875 billion is one of them cost them to set up the infrastructure the present value cash flow to developing the drug is 3422 million you take the difference between those two numbers you get 547 there what does that mean that's just my neck person but the traditional Capital budgeting that's where I'd stop the net present value of this project is 547 million I want you to remember that that's your intrinsic value for the project right 547. but remember they have the right to develop the drug anytime over the next waiting can provide the benefits maybe they can fine tune the drug reduce side effects so let's look at the optional idea which is you have 17 years of life left so you can you have such time as your ally riskless rate was 6.7 percent this is a very risky business I I tried a multicolor simulation but in the late 90s I had the architecture there's no crystal ball here today I might try a full-fledged simulation in that in the late 90s I basically took the standard deviation of Biotech companies and assumed that that's all driven by the uncertainty of firefighter products and use that as one standardization tremendous amount of uncertainty about the future 0.224 and each this is about if it's a viable do I go around this is greater than K 3.422 billion is greater than 2.875 billion if I choose to wait what do I lose I lose one out of those 17 years of protection that I have cost to delayer 5.8 plug-in D1 D2 end of D1 end of D2 remember I said enter P2 gives you a rough estimate of the probability that this drug will be developed file it away because you know it looks at least in this model that there's a substantial amount of uncertainty in the future you plug the numbers in the value that I get for the call if I plug into a blackshops I accept it you know it's not a perfect morning it's an European option all that put in place the value that I get for the auction is to your buyer to level three 547 million which is 907 million which is the value of this drug as an option if I'm in MS patient this is very bad useful you know why because based on those two numbers what am I asking you to do not development you would give up something for 170 but there's enough benefit from waiting that you get the option in fact you know I actually brought it out when they would actually develop the drug if these numbers stayed when they were so basically they would not develop the drug to almost year nine because the benefits away but but then there's one final part of the story that that I think brings us back to life at biotin action almost instantaneously developed what am I missing in my cost to delay because the cost of there is what's causing this waiting right basically what am I missing in my cost to delay that's leading me to overestimate myself there aren't any other solutions to ask you right if I am the only foreign you wait until it's the right time and then Kick It In in this case what was happening with the two other I think it's Merck and up John that had their own Ms drugs working their way through pipeline invited said we can't wait because what does it take to cause 117. they got here at a four-year leap on the competition you know the next Hospital in one over four which is 25 you put in a 25 cost of the layer the option pricing value drops to 350 million Which is less than five four you know 547 million I think that we over play the optionality in the pharmaceutical business if there's a lot of competition once in a while if you have a blockbuster drug with no competition on the horizon and once in a while there is that that happens then you have this worry of how long will the pharmaceutical company wait because there is a benefit to waiting in collecting more information making sure the side effects are right when it comes at the cost of people with that disease would like that drug right now so the option add here group is reflected in that print so you can value evidence as an option but let's put in that assumption that you know your either or unicure be embedded in the cash flows that you estimated but it's on top of that so it will affect both your expected cash flows and so you might have pricing per hour for the next five years but this is over and above that right it's how quickly do we need to jump off and to start making money before somebody else comes in and makes certain audience even lower so I think that even if you build it into your margins it's not going to affect the option and so it might affect the present value the S the model but it won't affect the conclusion which is you will develop almost much more quickly when there's competition there is there is a benefit to having a comparative pharmaceutical business where multiple companies are working on Solutions across as opposed to a monopoly for the Sudoku company which is the only game in town and this is one of benefits you will get drugs come out quicker because no company can sit on a solution for too long because it's too much to lose so let's suppose you're not interested in buying a single drug you're valuable company and it happens to have a very valuable pattern you're saying how do I make this a cut you could you can't go out and buy shares in the truck right you've got to buy shares in the company let's say you're interested inviting like Avalanche you say but I want to Value Biogen as a company well the way one way to do it is in the discarded cash flow model if I told you Biogen if I have an accent it's a great blockbusted drug that's working so true how do you reflect that in a PCM mode be sure there's higher Revenue growth because they're going to enter the MS Market higher margins flows income of the beneficial that's that option is always up that's the option that we do an intrinsic valuation is we use the argument that a company has a great fat what patterns to justify higher growth but there's another approach that might work especially you have small pharmaceutical companies with a single big patent driving event and there are quite a few of those where one pattern is that you can value the company three pieces first you value the existing products that the company has the traditional discounted cash flow application no growth is like existing products valuable products second stop you value the options just like I did see value and the times happen this is the trickiest you take the existing r d and you ask how much value will my existing r d create or destroy over time you already see why right we talked about how hard they can be value creating value Destroyer so you can actually value the company three pieces existing products patents and continued they were collectively generating about 50 million in after tax cash flow of zombies on guaranteed licenses 50 million every year for the next five years if that's all you have is that set of cash flows you can value them right you'd have to Discount the 50 million back to today at the right discount rate so what's the discount rate I should use on these expected cash flows these are biogens expected but who's Banker up John whoever is getting the truck right who's who bought the right to the drug trouble what are they guaranteed you they guaranteed you that they will pay you 50 million so what are you worried about so far the discount rate here has reflected risk in the cash flows the risk in the cash flows comes from the fact that they're guarantor on my default so to Discount these cash flows are used to pre-tax cost of debt of the guaranteeing companies what I'm trying to say is don't be so quick to jump on Caustic averages in this country every single time in fact let me reframe this what if Biogen had had the same Two drugs but they sold the Medicare and the U.S government had guaranteed them 50 million a year for the next 12 years so I think it's so easy we jump on to a caustic capital for company but think about the risk in these cash for the present value the cash flows was 397.139 so I've got a value of having X as an option I've got the value of the existing drugs they have at the present value of cash flows get some numbers too why because who knows what the quality of our data companies all you have is a young company has had some success but I mean I I'm going to try my best I took the r d expenses from the most recent year which are 100 million and assume they would continue to grow 20 a year for the next 10 years so big r d spending for next why am I doing this because I hope to generate new drugs new patterns in the future I'm going to assume that Biogen which has a history of three successes already can continue to generate those success we'll ask them what if question that and they can generate a dollar 25 in value for every dollar that they invest so if they invest 100 million dollars they create only expected is 125 million questions that that's built on earning return Capital about three to four percent about your cost of capital it's a dollar 25 each year and I'm gonna love for the fact that this is much riskier than everything else about Biogen and here I'm going to use a cost to Capital buyer as companies saying this is a risky body part so here's what the numbers were cut there's my expense in r d 120 million next year 100 million growing at 20 multiplied by 1.25 gives me the value of those and expect that no idea whether it'll actually happen a difference of 30 million because like that's very crazy everyone I discarded back at 15 did I do this every you take the sum of those values the value that I get from containing r d to 300 million dollars and I told you the 125 and value for every dollar in spending already comes from assuming they're not about three percent more than the cost of that if you want exactly your cost of capital what's that number going to be it's going to be one so basically and the value the r is equal to zero and if the return cap is three percent below the cost to Capital the contending Rd is actually going to have a negative value it's going to reduce the value of the company so this becomes a vehicle that he used that we but do you think this company has an r d Department convert adding value for because it's a history of the different success so my final evaluation of Biogen I took the the drug that already licensed out 397 million I added the value of having X as an option and the value of the continuing r d value that I get is 1.62 that's like the present value the free cash flow the firm is coming back at the cost of government so it's a different way of getting to that DCF bottom line but I've done it in pieces you did no debt the cash was close to zero and divided by the number of shares where the value per share of 45 seconds I did this for biotin because at the time that I did it was a small company got the bulk of its value essentially from the islands in fact I would never try this at America or advisor pick a what if I tried this in a fighter how many patents did supplies in there oh that's right I didn't sit there doing this in each one and the payoff to doing it is going to be far smaller because once you create a portfolio of option the benefits of looking at individual options stuff and that's when traditional DCF mods will allow you to say I have a portfolio of options I'm going to use a three percent higher growth rate and revenues and move on it's not precise but it's perhaps a more pragmatic solution if you have a bigger Pharma company but if you have a single patent farmer company or a former companies value the water and single packing this approach can give you a sense of what the value that is a couple of people in this classroom value is very young form of companies often with one pack can at least try the option price as well seems like a lot of the value in the option is attached to the variants that you think exactly which which actually is some very interesting implications if you think of r d as the cost you're paying require option because that's where the snow becomes right what does it tell you about where pharmaceutical companies should be erected already most risky the most uncertain parts of healthcare because that way the payoffs are is going to be great so it does mean that there'll be a redirecting of r d so you're saying why is my my you know I'm getting you know migraines and why isn't somebody coming up with a better migraine medication it might turn under the migraine medication the uncertainty in that part of the business is low enough that people don't billions of dollars in r d and the apprehensive payoff is not as hard to the strange way gene therapy will beat out migraines every single day competing for that already not simply because there's higher upside right because the uncertainty about the future is greater great so in a strange way the implications of option pricing can also redirect where Healthcare spending is gone and the consequences other products and services any other questions okay so I'm going to start there I would see you on Wednesday remember again your business in the first questions of class so you try not to be late and we'll continue with options 
thank you yeah folks so the usual rules apply I'll let you know what the questions are done you can come pick them up um today I want to continue a discussion of real options first I want to make sure everybody's clear about why passions are an option or what has to be true for Patrick should be an option you gotta have legal protection against competition but remember I remember the competition you're protected against is only on the products that emerged from that Pact so if you've got a drug to treat no diabetes and a particular drug you get protection on the drug you don't get protection against other companies working on their own drugs and that undercuts the value the exclusivity again starts to fail so let's uh let's pass patterns to the test is there an option clearly the contingency is you will develop the patent if and only if the present value of the cash flows from developing the patent exceed the cost of the pattern is there exclusivity as we said no yes with the condition that if other companies are working on competing products the exclusivity doesn't go away but it starts to fit that's why whether I have an X you saw that quicker development and finally can I use an option pricing model I'm really stretching I'm surprising ones right the underlying asset is not traded the patent is not traded replication is impossible Arbitrage is impossible it's on can you guys on Zoom here that that mic is always live so Mike is on can you still can't hear me but the last session too I had trouble with the mic maybe the mic is going so which case too late to fix it for today's class nothing I can do about it but it if you look at can I apply an option pricing model you're stretching the limits of option pricing models replication impossible Arbitrage if possible you're putting an option pricing model you get a number I'm not sure what you can do with that number so today I want to move on to a second example of an option to delay it's with natural resource companies if you think about natural resource companies you can break them into two parts again existing reserves that they've already developed which are not options because you're always coming out of those reserves an undeveloped reserves that they would like to develop they have the right to develop so again let's set up the structure let's say the cost of developing these reserves is X and the expected value of oil under the reserves is being if B is greater than x you will develop the reserves and keep the difference if that's not the case you will sit on those reserves an exam classic example of this is petrobras developed millions of barrels of oils in reserve and oil pressure high then oil prices drop they had the reserves they were not viable but they were still valuable as options just in case all the prices go back up so if I were to draw a payoff diagram for developing undeveloped reserves the cost of developing the reserve becomes the equivalent of the strike price the value of the oil under the ground estimated oil under the ground becomes equivalent to the stock price to life of this option depends on how long you get the reserves for right in much of the world the way you get reserved Sports you bid for them at government auctions so Arctic oil reserves opened up the auction gives you the right to develop those uh sort of finite period after which the reserves revert back to the government it's not in perpetuity century ago that wasn't true you got the results you basically owned them okay so you have 20 years that becomes the life of the option and here again we need to introduce a cost of delay right because if you have reserves that become viable part of you says let's wait oil prices could go to 150 dollars a bit but the other part says we don't develop the results now we'll give up the cash flows we can get from developing the results that becomes a cost at land if I'm explicitly emphasizing the cost to delay it's a central theme in real options most real options you have to have an estimate of a cost delay it's the equivalent of the dividend year which forces the option to get exercise starting let's try this divide to Value non-developed preserve let's go input by input again I need a value of the reserves in the ground first how do all companies know how many barrels of oil there are on the ground presumably this is why they hire all those geologists to go tap the ground say 100 million barrels you know what their track record on detecting oil is much better than macro economists forecasting interest rates I'm not going to pick on them the 80 million barrels 100 million barrels you multiply by the oil price today which you know you can use for but it's got to be today's prices that becomes yes much easier than the value of an auction right we had to do present value the cash flows here there's oil there's an oil price you get the value of the circle graph what's your cost in developing the reserve well it depends on where in the world you are if this is Saudi Arabia the reserves might cost almost nothing to develop the oil so close the ground but it's Canada it might require a huge amount of investment and oil companies have a pretty good sense of what that is that becomes the strike price the time to expiration here is however long you have the rights to this reserve the longer those rights last the more valuable the reserves will come to you and in this case actually the variance becomes much simpler to compute than in the case of a pact remember that you had to run a simulation on cash flow see what that standard deviation was what's the big unknown here what will happen to oil prices but all prices are traded traded acid a traded commodity you can get the standard deviation in oil prices over time that becomes the variance in values basically the variance in the oil price it's an observable already you can see why real options have their deepest roots and natural resource companies natural resource companies actually use real options in a tangible way because the numbers are easier to get feature that you produce from the reserve the cash flows you get becomes equivalent of the dividend yield that's a cost to delay because now I'm saying it's a viable Reserve you don't produce it that cash flow is not coming there's one final aspect of undeveloped natural resources that has to be brought into play let's save an oil company you have undeveloped preserves oil prices go up from fifty dollars to eighty dollars the reserves are not now what viable you decide to develop them yeah they all come out of the ground the next day between the decision to develop an actual oil coming out of the ground take a year two years depending on where the reserves are and how you get them out of the ground there's a there's a delay between when you make the choice to develop and that's you know intuitively you know that's going to reduce the value of the option because you get out there you're all excited all prices are 80 dollars you develop you decide to put the order out to develop the reserves you know what can happen in the two years you wait before the oil comes out of the ground you can go back down to 60 dollars essentially there's a present value effect that's got to be factored and that's going to lower the value of that old result so let's let me try this on a real company it's a really old case and the only reason I have to go back to this case is the data that I needed to Value the undeveloped results was fully provided it's a company called gulfoil that was targeted for a hostile acquisition in 1984. so the start the the target the price at which it was being bid at was 70 and one of the reasons was targeted is because of undeveloped results so here's what golf oil had as undeveloped reserves they're 3.038 billion barrels of oil in undeveloped preserves all over the world the estimate then was the cost of developing these results would be about ten dollars per bear so it'll cost them 30.38 billion if they decide to develop all the reserves right away so think of that as the strike price it's what they would have to invest up front to develop these results so I have the k for the model the value the price of oil at that time was 22.38 per barrel and the variable cost of extracting the Oliver seven so every every barrel of oil they get out of the ground they make 15.38 so you can think of what that present value would be over time of developing the results incidentally they had the rights to these results on average for 12 years the reason I throw the hour on average is these results were in different parts of the world some parts that six years some part 15 the average is about 12. and finally the oil press variance was about 0.03 and you can make it into a standard deviation but basically the variance in all prices 0.03 that's what's going to drive the optionalities oil prices are volatile you're trying to make a bet on should I develop the results right now t-bond right there was nine percent this is actually not a made-up number the t-bond rate in 1984 was nine percent so when you hear people bitching and moaning about three and a half percent rate and how horrific it is and how no can nobody can live at these rates hey people with have lived with far higher rates in the past so let's take this apart so let's suppose you want to Value these undeveloped results first thing I did was I take took the 3038 million barrels and I took a shortcut normally you'd have to estimate how much oil you'd produce each year get the expected cash flows each year and take the present value using a cost to cap for an oil company right so basically that's how you do this kind of cash flow valuation here I took the three to 38 million barrels multiplied by 1538 that's a variable the contribution The Profit they make per barrel and I've said look I have to wait two years before I get to see the oil even if I decide so that's basically bringing back the cash flows for the first two years I get a present value of oil under the ground of 42.38 billion I want you to remember that number so if I developed the reserves today with the two-year lag the value of the oil is 42.38 billion the cost I left to invest up front to do this is 30.38 I take 42.38 minus 30.38 I get a discounted cash flow valuation of these Reserves that discounted cash flow valuation is 12 billion dollars and that's why we'd stop a DCF right let's see what optionality does for us here you have 12 years left in the reserves oil price of Oracle is riskless rate of nine percent and the equivalent of the dividend yield becomes five percent the cash related you take the D1 D2 n of T1 n of D2 it remind me again what nfd2 tells me it's a rough estimate of the likelihood that this option will be in the money which means there's an 85.4 chance I will develop the results not surprised because these are viable reserves already but here's the match of option pricing you plug those numbers in the value that you get for these reserves that we just valued at 12 bit of the DCF model becomes 13.3 billion dollars where's the extra I mean this is magical right I've taken a DCF value added 1.3 billion what is that extra 1.3 billion in value or where is it coming from here I'll tell you why if I take the variance oil prices and make them zero what will happen to the value of the option it's going to go to 12 billion in other words all of the value will disappear the minute the variance goes from three percent to zero percent and I think the variance of oil price and push them to 10 percent that extra premium will jump to two and a half billion so it can't just be time value because it seems to be a function of the variance in the oil press yes well in two ways one is when you have non-viable reserves and somebody comes to you and says look I'd like to buy a non-viable reserve for you which oil companies do all the time and oil prices you know drop to really low levels you can estimate the value of the reserves right now they're non-viable but there'll be an option value because and the more volatile oil prices become the more careful you've got to be about not giving away undeveloped reserves even if they're non-viable it's a I mean the premium is coming from the fact that as oil prices move the reserves could go from being low value reserves to high value results [Music] in this case you actually will hold off on developing at least some of the reserves so in a sense the higher the variance in oil prices become the more you will find oil companies holding back on developing the reserves right away because there is a value to waiting of course there is this existential question that all companies face now it's about 10 years from now you're not allowed to take any oil out of the ground but if you did not have that you can see why all companies and this is why when all prices jump to 140 dollars about you don't see everybody trying to develop everything there's another implicit assumption we're making here that can also kind of crimp your development the results as you develop the results you have no effect on oil prices I take 3.038 billion then demand and Supply basically leaves the oil prices where it is that might be okay if you're a small oil company but a ramco said look we're going to take 300 billion barrels of oil out of the ground right now then the it's almost like a you know when you have an employee option the exercise the option affects the stock price so very large oil companies have to be cautious about not jumping in just because reserves have become viable because it's got to be some buffer there's going to be a price effect yes foreign it's as simple as that if the present value of the oil you will get from developing the reserves is less than the cost of developing the reserves you're underwater these are non-viable reserves and there's a problem here because oil companies are required to report reserves but only viable results so if you look at many oil company 10ks there will be a footnote on these are reserves but they're required to report only viable reserves which means as oil prices drop you'll actually see reserves reported drop off it's not that they have less reserves but they're not required some oil companies go well beyond what's required and it will show you all reserves in the percentage which are viable the reason I went back to 1984 in Gulf all they've showed all their reserves with the development costs I could see that I was not leaving any reserves on the ground because if all I do is apply this unviable reserves I'm missing the other part of the reserves which still have option value right because oil prices could change enough to make them Buy but it does create some interesting implications we know the value of an oil company is affected by the level of oil prices we all know that's pretty straightforward right you know what this also tells you right not only is the level of oil prices critical but how volatile oil prices are can also affect the value of an oil company the best case scenario for oil companies is high and volatile the worst case scenario is low and boring 1980s and 90s kill dollar companies oil prices went to 25 dollars a barrel and just stayed there but you can also see low and volatile you might benefit still as an oil company the volatility and companies with lots of reserves will benefit more than companies that get the bulk of the value from developing existing results so natural resource reserves are interesting because they they allow you to you're getting closer to be being able to apply option pricing models can you trade the underlying asset what is the underlying asset the oil under the ground it's a tradeable asset can you trade the option reserves get bought and sold all the time between oil companies this is about as close as you can get to an option pricing model working all the way through so finally I'm going to bring those reserves in to try to Value golf oil as a company Golf Hall at the time that I looked at this had developed reserves on our developed research the developed reserves had about 10 years of cash flows left at 9 15 million dollars a year I discounted those reserves the traditional way at this at a cost of capital that reflector so basically everything we have in DCF no architecture we pull out take the 950 million 915 million treated as an annuity for the next 10 years Credit Value is 5.065 value I take that as my starting point to that I add the value of the undeveloped reserves 13.3 billion the total value of the firm is the sum of the two again if I just did not want to bring out the option technology here I could take the company put in a higher growth rate say they have lots of reserves and do that as an alternative but don't do both don't do a DCF with a growth rate because it reserves and then on top of that add the value of the reserves as an option because that would be double County yes it's an option on an option okay I'm not sure what that what that does for you an option on lots of things about me I'm gonna argue later today that stock in a publicly traded company is an option option to liquidate right you own the equity so every you have options and options and options and they start to compound over time so it's a variance at each level kind of digging in and no and the further down the ladder you are in terms of where you are with the options the more pain you will feel in terms of voluntary or actually gain you will see from all dirty so any questions on so on developer preserves there's clearly an option there's clearly exclusivity it comes from the fact that natural resources are limited and it's the closest you're going to get to being able to meet the conditions for an option pricing model so oil companies have been using options for 30 years now internally on decisions on how to Value reserves whether to shut down reserves and open reserves the mining companies do it all the time and you can see that it works for them because the Mechanics Work Out so any asset that has natural scarcity kind of meets this exclusivity condition you know that a building in New York has significant optionality first you know the fact that real estate it's an island right it's not Kansas City you can't keep building out and then further and further away you go to Vegas you can see there's really no constraint so to begin with there's an island you have limited land but here's the reason the optionality in real estate New York kick set know that almost every square foot of New York has restrictions on what can be built on it so if you bought you know if you were able to buy an old building down in the East Village which is three floors and say you know what I'm just going to knock it down build a 50-floor building it's not that simple the square footage is already specified of course right now you're under the square footage you don't want to develop it right now because you don't think you can make the rental income you can see the optionality you're paying for the building and the option to convert that building into a nine-story building there are options in real estate that often affect the value of a property and how much you're willing to pay for a property yup it's not that you plan to develop the property right now but the right to develop the property becomes that added value that you're willing to pay but it's going to be greater in Manhattan than in a part of the world where you can essentially but but real estate is not as constrained you can basically build up let's talk about the option to expand and this is where I think things get interesting because you guys have the option to expand goes back I come to you with a project and I tell you upfront look this is a terrible project net negative Net Present Value process just as you get ready to shut it down I say but it could give you the rights to a second project which could potentially be lucrative and he said what does that mean potentially lucrative right now it looks bad too so essentially you're taking a bad project for the rights to an even worse project done the first project is not an option you're going to take it but if you do there is this option to expand right right now it looks bad but here's why it could still have bad think about the payoff diagram you could spend the additional money to expect when would you do it only if you believe the present value of the cash flows from expanding are greater than the cost of expansion so you take the first bad project saying it may be the second project will pay off I get not over the next 10 years could that in the second project never materialize yeah in which case what do you lose whatever the net negative net price so see this cost of the option that's a negative net present value of the first project you essentially write it off saying I wish I hadn't taken that first project sounds innocuous but this is at the heart of the Strategic argument right when people say this is a Strategic investment what are they saying this investment is not going to make money but it could give us all this neat stuff in the future it's an options argument they don't use that language but they're using an options argument so let's say when that argument makes sense and when it does and I'll use a very simplistic valuation to illustrate how this can add value to your DCR let's say you value a company right this is I I it's an antivirus software company you do the expected free cash flow cost of capital you come up with 115 million it's a small company 115 million you're done the DCF value is done and then the company says look in the process of selling a software we're collecting data on our customers that we can use to create a second business a database business so this is a platform argument we have a platform of customers who use our existing virus software we're going to and we're collecting data on that platform that will allow us to come up with a database business and I ask you well how much will it cost you to build that business you said it will cost us about a half a billion dollars what will you make well about 40 million a year and after tax cash flows for the next 10 years already without even doing present value you can see this is not looking like a great business right you invest a half a billion up front you make 40 million every year for the next 10 years you don't even have to do any present value you're already underwater by the way it is a risky business so the cost of capital is 12 percent let's assume that there is substantial uncertainty about how the database based business will evolve so the 50 standard deviation that's what's going to potentially rescue you you have the capacity to develop the second product in the new business and the standard deviation the risk free rate is three percent so here's what I'm going to do I know the discarded cash flow value 115 million I set it to the sack I say look there is this option to develop a second business let's see how much that business that option is worth so the s in the model is the present value of 40 million for 10 years at a 12 cost of capital I come up with 226 million the strike price the cost of entering the market is 500 million you take the difference between those two numbers as a pure npv it's minus 274 million here's the magic and danger of optionality I now say look only I can do it because I'm collecting the data I have in this case five years to develop it and a standard deviation of 50 percent in value call option I get with those absolutely horrendous inputs for SNK of 56 million dollars in businesses where there's an extreme amount of uncertainty even bad technologies will sell for high prices because you're effectively buying options they're not mispricing them so in fact right now I'm I'll wager AI products and services are selling for absolutely absurd prices because people see a big Mark and they say and the question you got to ask is how much exclusivity do I get that's really what this dress saw you have to convince me that the data you're collecting that will allow you to create this database business is unique to you as opposed to what a lot of the user-based companies use this argument implicitly right they said look I know I'm lying my rent out bikes I know the business is never going to work out but I'm collecting data on my users and I might be able to come up with a new business that I can use the data on the only problem is the kind of data lime collection uses is primarily location data it's not preference State it's not which a hundred other companies have you can very quickly see the options arguments start to dissipate if you test them on exclusively so it is true that this argument can be used to justify you know adding a premium to DCF entering into a big Market even though you're not going to make money but I think you need to ask the right question in this case the question you've got to ask is what is that exclusivity where does it come from and you can frame it in terms of competitive advantages right because if you have Superior competitive advantages barriers to entry that's a version of exclusivity you can say look I and only I can do this and even though it's not viable today the option to do it is worth a lot and the less your competitive advantages are the less value there is to the expansion option so the next time you hear somebody using a strategic argument push them on the exclusivity component because if you fight them on the Strategic domain you will always lose because big thinkers always look like hey you know I have a vision you don't this is nothing to do with vision it's about the fact that I agree with you AI is a big Market but why this product what is the exclusivity that comes with it because without the exclusively the value the option dissipates very quickly so the option to expand is there an option yeah technically yes it's on the second project not the first one is there exclusivity that's where the questioning begins because sometimes there is if the case I gave you it came from the fact that you collected data that was unique that you could use to develop a second business but lots of times there isn't if there isn't exclusivity take the options argument off the table can I use an option pricing model again I'm risking a lot of assumptions right can I trade the underlying asset not really there is no business the database business doesn't exist the business doesn't exist the option on the business doesn't exist again it's very much like patents I am using an option pricing model where now the replication nor Arbitrage is that easy to do the way this is going to play out in the evaluation I'll tell you how it played out in in my value in one of my valuations I remember when right after the Cambridge analytica Scandal Facebook stock price dropped I'd always find Facebook to be overvalued for much of its public existence until that Scandal happens based by for the stock price dropped it dropped but barely below the value that I had I think the value is that I got was 132 the stock was at 129 and I chose to buy it which goes against what investors at all right you need a margin of safety the margin of safety should be larger for riskier firms and smaller for safer folks and I remember getting pushback saying you know why would you buy fan and I said look I value Facebook as an online advertising company it has three billion users in its ecosystem right now all it does is sell them advertising is it collecting exclusive data on its users God is it collecting new data that you don't even want to know what they know about you it's at the heart of the problem with Facebook right when you say privacy it's basically saying they're collecting data about me that I don't want them to know my response is going to be unprintable but I will leave leave it there but they are collecting data right now they either haven't figured out how to use the data or they feel a little queasy about using that data but there is an option out here we can't I mean there is no debate that there is optionality in Facebook the question we can argue is how big is that value but here the way it affected my decision is look I think Facebook is close to fairly value but that's without the option we can debate how much the auction is worth but it's icing on top of my valuation so while I don't explicitly value this option to expand it comes into play when I make investment decisions I'm far more likely to buy you know Google when it's five percent undervalued than I am to buy Coca-Cola when it's five percent under value what's the option are you going to get in Coca-Cola what are they going to do come up with a beverage that makes you thinner I don't ask me that's a risky thing to even throw out there it's there's not much upside left there right it doesn't make it a bad investment it just the way it shows up in a good year for Coca-Cola will be at 30 so out comes here are the best case so if you did a simulations Coca-Cola's value your best case value is not going to be 15 times or 20 times your estimate value probably one and a half or two times your estimated right it's a different kind of investment there's a place for Coca-Cola in your portfolio but there's also a place for companies with optionality so as you look at platform companies you look at a zoom you look at a Peloton they've been beaten up over the last two years there's a point where you have to decide step in and say you know what they've been beaten up but they've also collected information the question God asked is is that unique information I'm not sure what Peloton collects about its subscribers but I'm I'm pretty sure it's got something to do with what kind of physical activity you know how much you do you know and whether you're regular about the activity or not and if they chose to use it they could mythical Weight Watchers right it's been around forever recently they bought a drug that's been approved by the FDA for the first time they went from their traditional we'll send you meals so the traditional Weight Watcher model is you subscribe to Weight Watcher you get a you you get a social network of people who try to talk you into not overeating but you also get this is the first time they've gone past that but you can see the potential right they know a great deal about the users who trust them they're very few and to the extent that they can trust them this might give them a platform to take a drug like this and say you know what this is the 10 of our users where it's most useful it's an optionality coming into play and you know a dangerous your growth rate might it depends on what when did your growth rate the growth rate I used was an online advertising growth rate remember you said the total addressable market market share so unless you've somehow set a total addressable Market that includes two other potential businesses in which case you're right there's double counting no so you since you control what you did in your DCF you know what you've already counted first one and captured the opportunity that was really about the change in the car service business the option of being the overall car service business he wasn't really I mean to be quite honest almost really never figured out how to make money and anything other than car service and food delivery right Trucking basically is just a morass you know moving there I don't even think they're Uber moving even is around anymore but that was one of the things he did throw it out there but he never put a number out there right which is and I didn't even try to bring in some of the new businesses they could do right now do you think uh Tesla polls are making an options argument for Tesla did you read the art thing that came out last week it was the most outlandish piece of I don't ever call it research it was about automated driving and I looked at the number and I said I'm not sure where this number is coming from but you're making an options argument which is you know if you buy Tesla at 160 you're getting a great car company and you're getting this optionality to be this leader in the automated driving business people throw out options arguments all the time and by forcing them to then confront the specifics of their own argument you can talk about when the arguments make sense and what they don't any other questions yes I don't care right because all I have is intrinsic value right the price is whatever it is right so what I control is the value right as long as the price is less than the value I'm getting a bargain my value doesn't include any of this so I'm going to add the option value I have no idea what's in the price to be quite honest it doesn't matter right in a sense if let's say it does reflect options you know how it's going to show up the price is going to be 250 dollars per share I'm going to say look I'm not going to buy Facebook and I'm going to move on he would over estimate the value of the options so we have no idea what the price includes or does it it's not like investors come and say I'm buying this stock for the option that you buy or sell so all you observe in the price is a number that's why you try to build the value up from scratch on the other hand to see if in fact you can get above the price you might not maybe the price is being set so high because of the optionality you can't even get to that point You could argue that maybe with AI that's already happening with some companies price is getting pushed up so much on pure oxygen of this big Market that you can't get there with an intrinsic valuation plus an options argument so you got option to delay option expand let's take the third option the option to abandon it's the only real option that's a put option it gives you the right to walk away from an investment you've already made and here's how it plays out you have an investment I give you the option to walk away if you walk away you get let's say half of what you invest so you can you're you know you're going to lose money but essentially I cap your loss so so basically I put a limit on your Downs so let's see how this plays out so let's say your Airbus and a lure aircraft and Lear as lyric aircraft I really really want to be in a joint venture with you because leader aircraft traditionally has produced corporate Jets Airbus of course has commercial Jets and Leah says look we want to produce commercial Jets as well but we can't do it on our own so I approach you with a joint venture proposal so you're going to have 50 I'm going to have 50 percent and you estimate your expected cash flows to decide what to do this you expect to see you take the pre so the 50 that I offer you I want 500 million for and you calculate the cash flows and you come up with a present value of cash flows of 480 Mill it's enough we're not interested why because you're asking me for 500 million it's worth only 480. so I offer you an add-on I said look I know the net present value is minus 20 million but if you invest and you change your mind anytime over the next five years we will buy your 50 share back from you for 400 million 100 million less than what you've invested but basically I'm saying you cannot lose more than 100 the option to back so let's see whether this might tilt the scale because without it it's a minus 20 million dollar that person back so the question is is the option to abandon worth more than 20 million because if it is I can take this investment that looks bad and make it into a good investment so let's say you've done a simulation of the cash flows because you aren't like oil prices you can't observe the standard deviation come up where uh a variance of 0.16 and let's say the project has a life of 30 years that's going to come into play so you have the right any time over the next five years to walk away from the joint venture so let's value the point the present value the cash flows is 480 a million the strike price has 400 million but remember this is a put it's an out of the money option because what exercise today why walk away 400 million but any time over the next five years if the present value drops below 400 million you will of course exercise your right to that you see why I have to give you this right only for the next five years if not for the next 30 Years if I gave you this right for the next 30 Years you know exactly what you're going to do you're going to wait for 29 years and 364 days and the day before the project is supposed to be wound up he said you know what I changed my mind give me 400 minutes which point the project is really worth nothing so that's why I stopped after five years incidentally this is a finite life project so each year that you wait remember the net present the present value is going to get less 29 years 28 years and here because I know what the cash flows are I compute that 130th each year that I waited because so that becomes the dividend yield and here it's going to push up the value of the option I plug the numbers in I come up with the value for the put option of 73.23 million getting the right to be able to walk away anytime over the next five years on this project is worth 73 million what is the npv minus 20 million by giving you this option to walk away I've made it more likely I can't guarantee it that you will become a joint venture partner this is a win right but here's the one thing I have to remember I essentially gave you an option what 73 million so what should my Net Present Value from this project have to be for this to be a good good decision to make on my side of the joint venture I better be making an npv well above 73 million otherwise I've given you an option which I didn't really afford which I can't really afford options to abandon essentially allow people to walk away from mistakes I mean at well below what they originally invested but it still limits your losses to whatever that amount is here are the implications for investing first having an option to abandon a project is always good but you have to work at creating it so you in terms of when you put together long projects here are some of the things you might consider you know having shorter term contracts even though they might cost you more than longer term contracts the rule you're always given is if you can if you have a third year project try to lock in things for the next 30 Years there's a downside to doing that having shorter contracts give you the flexibility yes so I remember I'm giving you this option so I don't want to give you something that's so incredibly valuable that I end up poverty stripping right what I give you comes out of my pocket this is a zero-sum game so collectively we're gaining nothing from this but you're gaining at my expense so left your own devices Airbus will want a 30-year option but I can't afford to do that if I did that I'd wipe myself up so this is not just about increasing the value of the option to abandon because somebody has to pay for it here in this case that's so in terms of implication just means building in more flexibility into your projects in terms of taking them over multiple stages rather than all at one stage having contracts that expire in three years rather than in 30 years can add value to a project because it gives you some optionality final piece to today let's talk a little bit about flexibility in general I mean if you think about you know about this has become a big buzzword in companies we want to be flexible we want to be adaptable I think what we're talking about here is optionality to me the ultimate flexible company here's what happens when you have something good happen in a project you take advantage of it to make it even better but if something bad happened you walk away sooner than everybody else that gives me the old Goldman Sachs reputation right which is they all well it might be because of Goldman Sachs guy was always at the top of the treasury but it might also have been that they had the capacity to walk away from mistakes a little sooner than everybody else that's an options argument for flexibility and you could argue that companies that have more flexibility when you do a DCF model should have that premium built into that because even though you have expected cash flows they're going to find a way to augment the good thing good things that happen and kind of protect themselves against the bad things so let's talk about one specific aspect of flexibility which is financial flexibility now if you if you're some of you are in my Corporate Finance classes well we talk about the optimal debt ratio for a company optimal debt ratio is 40 but we also see that many companies choose to stay below their options not that they don't know that they're under lever but they choose to be under 11. and one of the arguments they use for not using that excess debt capacity is an options argument and here's how the options argument goes we know we're under levered by 30 we know we have a higher cost to Capital than we should but that's okay because that excess debt capacity is going to come into play in case we get a once in a lifetime project coming at us two years from now we don't see it yet but could come at any time that's the key here is something an unexpected shows up so so think of what when a company sets aside no it decides how much to borrow and how much to reinvest it has an expected reinvestment because each year we expect to invest 100 million so let's say let's make that the strike price but if you get the this incredible project that shows up your reinvestment needs are going to be far larger than what you get in a typical year so typically you invest 100 million a year the project shows up you need a billion if you have excess debt capacity here's what you hope to do you hope to take that excess debt capacity and take that once in a lifetime project so you're preserving excessive capacity to be able to take that insanely great and if you do you get the net present value of that project that becomes the upside is it possible that that great project might never show up yeah in which case what have you lost by being under levered you are a much higher cost to Capital than you did and that becomes the cost so actually you know what you can actually try to Value this flexibility but more interesting than putting a value into flexibility is actually thinking about the implications so this is actually from one of my earlier editions of Applied Corporate Finance I compute an optimal debt ratio for this need to be 40 cost a capital of 11.64 they were actually at 18 percent and in a sense you could see Disney Noodle and delivered in the argument we need the excessive capacity we'll come back and examine it but one of the things I tried to do is estimate how much that excess debt capacity was creating its value as an option right now what are they paying for the option the cost of capital is 12.22 it could be 11 points they're paying 0.58 percent each year because they want to preserve flexibility this this option value is kind of murky so kind of hang in there to Value this option I need to First figure out you know what they create as cash flows each year so that becomes the s in the model the K in the model becomes what you you know how much you can raise this capital from within so right now what they what they require is three Investments about 5.3 percent of value what they can come up with as cash flows is 4.8 percent but there's uncertainty about that reinvest coming from where they might have to do a big acquisition a huge investment so if you think of this as the option the right to be able to take an investment that's much larger than your typical investment the value that you get for the flexibility is about 0.85 percent here comes out it looks like it's magical but basically it says look because you're uncertain about your future reinvestment needs that flexibility is worth 0.85 here what do they pay each year for it 0.58 percent a year it if the numbers are hold up it basically means that when Disney says we're not going to the optimum we're going to accept a higher cost of capital you step back and say okay I have a good reason for doing so that's okay so next session we start I want to look at this value flexibility at least in terms of implication which is a very interesting you know implications for what kinds of companies should be under level and actually it's the right thing for them to do and what kinds of companies should be forced towards their Optimum 
there we go [Music] originally um thank you [Music] um thank you very much [Music] foreign something left so people have just given up and picking up the questions I think okay um quick reminder so you shouldn't need them next week is when your project is due wheat Prem today by five o'clock it doesn't have to be in class um no Excel spreadsheet just a report with you know it's just summarizing your DCF valuation that's story page alone tells me everything I need to know about your company so give me the story page from your DCF a pricing basically the multiple you picked a very quick description of the comparable send a regression if you ran one and a pricing for one in ten companies maybe what we talk about today of applying option pricing will work and then a recommendation so this is in purple prose I'm not looking for extended discourses you don't have to give me business descriptions I kind of know what most of your companies do so you're going to give me a description make it short and tell me what no what what do you think it's basic business is but make it a PDF file it's easier for me to put in comments into a PDF file than it is but there'll be one report per group so I'd prefer that one person in the group sent me that report rather than each if you send me multiple copies of the same one make sure all your group members are in front in alphabetical order it makes my life a little easier when I enter your grades into bright space so very simple logistical stuff your final is 48 hours later so things come bang bang so project finalists I think on the 10th I think the actual time is 1 30 to 3 30 is I think the official time and make sure I you know I'll confirm that for you because sometimes I get the times differently so it'll be two hour final it'll be open book open Notes everything in the class which is a lot of stuff yeah so it'll be everything in quiz one quiz two quiz three and the stuff after so with that lead in let's um let's complete our discussion of real options I was talking about how companies sometimes stay below their optimal debt ratios not because they're being irrational but because they value Financial flexibility and I give you a very simple way of judging whether that makes sense I said when you're under level and you have too little debt your debt ratio 10 your optimal is 40 you're accepting a cost to Capital that is higher than it needs to let's say it's the case of Disney it was like 50 basis points they're accepting a higher cost of capital you're saying why would I do that because you value Financial flexibility and we said Financial flexibility is an option an option to take great projects that you don't see on the horizon right now but might unexpectedly show up you can value that as an option it's an option to put numbers on but in the case of Disney I came up with 85 basis points so they use the trade-off but being under lever they give up 50 basis points a year but by being on the level they get this flexibility of option that's what KD5 basis points which means that they should stay on the level even though it looks like their cost of capital is high as I said that option itself is tough to get the inputs on the implications though are very interesting if you think about what kinds of companies should value Financial flexibility the most so these are the companies that should be most under levered companies with capital constraints should value Financial flexibility a great deal more than companies without Capital constraints you know the implication guy right I would expect private companies to be more under levered than public companies I would expect small companies to be more under level than large companies I would expect Emerging Market companies to be more under levered than developed Market companies I would expect markets after crises to pull back on debt a lot more than companies that have been in Good Touch so first thing that matters is capital constraints not all capital constraints are external some are inter you know what I mean by that many companies will refuse to issue new Equity once they're public companies they hate issuing new shares why there's delusion so some of this is internally set and that often will also feed into Capital constraints a more internal Capital constraints you put in the more under levered you need to be to make up for the fact that you can't issue Equity at the drop of a half second the more unpredictable your reinvestment needs remember it's an option option value comes from uncertainty if you're certain about your future reinvestment needs you don't need flexibility you just set aside the money infrastructure companies don't need flexibility they know exactly how much they're going to spend the more unpredictable your reinvestment needs are the more you will value flexibility the more under 11 you should be in businesses with a lot of uncertainty within businesses some companies grow with internal Investments some grow with acquisitions acquisition-driven growth is far more unpredictable than internal investment growth because you don't know what you'll have to pay who you're going to buy I would expect companies that grow through Acquisitions to hold back on debt capacity more because they value Financial flexibility but here's a final and to me the most significant component in whether you should stay on delivered because you value Financial flexibility why are you preserving this debt capacity because you want to take Investments right if you're in a business where the average investment earns its cost to Capital what's the net present value of that investment it's zero in other words if you're an average or bad businesses don't even talk to me about financial flexibility I don't want you to have any but if you are in a business where projects make significantly more than the cost of capital then we could talk about being under level so GM info say look we'd like to be under 11 because we value Financial flexibility my reaction is not on my watch your businesses are not good enough for that to be sustained so the better a business the more you value financials what this does is it gives you room for when you look at a publicly especially in corporate Financial you talk about optimal debt ratios give companies some Grace when they're on delivered saying in this company that's okay it's a young company it's a small company it's a capital restricted company it's in a great business therefore that's okay which brings me to the last application this in an ironic way is the most common way in which you can apply options in the context evaluation I'm going to argue that equity in a publicly traded company takes on the features of a call option here's what the first is equities of residual claim right basically you get whatever's left over after everybody else has been paid both in terms of operating cash flows every year and in liquidation the other feature of equity in publicly traded companies is limited liability tell me in Practical terms what does that mean limited Library that's large enough but remember your broker can't call you and say your share price went to minus 31 dollars please send 31 dollars more as opposed to a private business where Equity can have unlimited liability in a public so those two features conspire to create the equity option so let's set up the option what you have so you guys play play the role of equity investors I'm lenders to a company right so you run the company can Equity investors in a company choose to liquidate the company if they want to yeah no you get together in a meeting so what you know you have to get the board of directors to go along and say okay we're going to liquidate the Comfort if you liquidate the company what happens you get the value of the assets or whatever you get in liquidation you pay me off as the lender you get whatever's left over so if you think about the claim here the face value of the debt becomes the equivalent of the strike price because if you if you think of the option is the Liquidation option you liquidate you pay off the face value of the debt if the value of the firm exceeds the face value of the debt you get that difference as the equity investors if it's less the most you can lose is what you originally paid for the equity equity in a publicly traded firm is essentially a call option if you think about the liquidation as the strike features the exercise of the option sounds like a very strange view of equity right because most of us want to be about shares and companies buy it for different reasons you buy shares in Carnet what are we buying it for when you can help me on this one is I just want to get the dividend in my pocket right forget about the stability and the growth you get the dividend check it's like buying a bond I buy it for dividends I don't buy for a Liquidation option I buy shares in Microsoft why am I doing it because of dreams I have ai and how it's going to turn out and grow most companies in fact the discounted cash flow view of the world is to Value the company as a going concernance I'm buying a share of the going Goods but if you bought shares in Bed Bath and Beyond today are you buying it for the dividends I hope not there would be no dividends you're buying it as a going concern we're going good sir so why are you buying it for the same reasons you buy a deep part of the money option you hope that something good will happen you pray that something good will happen and most of the time nothing good happens so you take the 35 cents you paid per share you drop it in the trash can sounds like a crazy reason to buy right so what are you hoping for that's something some event will come around and turn the company around and the 35 cents will become two dollars it's not becoming a healthy company but it's becoming a less bankrupt company you buy it for the same reason to buy deep out of the money options that's why I said this approach to thinking about valuation works if you have a troubled company with a lot of debt because essentially what you're hoping for is something will move the value don't think too hard about where are you'll find you buy any Airline you are buying an option for the most part right there are no healthy on there are very few healthy going concerned valuations of Airlines maybe a Southwest at its peak you might have bought other airlines are in and out of bankruptcy all the time yes unlike a normal option and in practice you don't exercise if anyone right you can right you choose to but the thing is you'll wait and you wait and you wait because time is your ally so unlike other real options where you get early exercise here you're going to let it play for as long as you want but there can be forced exercise which is when the interest payments come due so that's something you got to build into the model is you control the action until you don't so the first example I'm going to set is going to show you how I deal with this I'm going to give you a very simplistic case of a company it's a company that right now is a value of a hundred millions you value the operating asset think of that as a TCF value the operating as it's 100 million but you're uncertain about that value so there's a standard deviation of 40 the value so 100 million existing value standard deviation of 40 percent this company has one nice 10-year zero coupon Bond you're going to see in a minute why I've constructed it this way is to give you as the equity investor maximum power a 10-year zero coupon bond with a face value of 80 million so I've given you the value of the company the standard deviation the value one zero coupon bond with an 80 million dollar face value and the 10-year bond rate is 10 I would argue that very very limited information you should be able to tell me how much the equity this company is worth and you should be able to tell me what interest rate you would charge in the debt I haven't given you betas cost of capital cash flows what did you what did I say you guys have you have yeah you have an option on the company right it's valued as an option what's the underlying asset it's a firm but the value of 100 million so s is going to become the 100 million because that's the value of the underlying company what's the strike price if you liquidate what do you have to pay out the 80 million that you have due on the Zero coupon bond that becomes a strike price how long do you have the power to run the business until the debt comes to you now you can see why I made it a nice zero coupon bond for the next nine years and 364 days all the bank you can do is complain but not much more so you got a 10-year option the variance in firm value that 40 squared is 0.16 and the riskless rate is 10 percent SK n of D1 n of D2 I'll come back and talk about the end of D2 because there's a very clear meaning to This n of D2 here but you plug in the numbers the value that I get for the call is 75.94 million saying what does that even mean the equity is the call option the company it's worth 75.94 million 100 million if 75.94 million is is equity the remaining 24.06 million is debt remember it's a zero coupon Bond so 80 million is due in 10 years the value today is 24.06 I solve for the interest rate I get an interest rate of 12.77 the default spread of 2.77 percent it's a very very skewed perspective Equity but you can see troubled companies how it gives you focus in your Equity you're buying a call option on the equity and that call option has a value of 75.94 the rest has to be done you go back to the end of the do you remember what the the the the intuitive meaning we put an energy to what does it measure the likelihood that this option will be in the money right there's a 63 chance that the value of the firm will be greater than the debt outstanding which means as a 37 chance of bankruptcy there's an output called kmb it's a West coast-based output that has used option pricing models to estimate default probabilities for companies loan portfolios they use an option pricing model they take the nd2 that that becomes 1 minus nd2 becomes a probability of default so 63 chance the company will make it and My Equity is worth 75.94 million so let's say you boy you look at this analysis you buy into my analysis you buy the equity for 75.94 million I'm going to use that now to ask some what if questions what if tomorrow you woke up to a catastrophic news story half your company has disappeared and it's not insured what is the value until yesterday a hundred million the value of the firm has now become 50 million unless you have a very perverse definition of good news this is not good news for you as an equity investor right see Equity yesterday was what 75.94 million it's clearly going to be worth less today so I have a very simple question how much less will the value back could it be and hear your choices value The Firm drops by 50 you can take 50 out of the value of the equity 75.94 minus 50 would give me 25.94 or maybe it'll drop by more than 50 million because your accountants are going to tell you the book value if Equity is negative now or it could drop by less than 50 minutes so three choices it'll drop by 50 million less than 50 million more than 50 million which one of those do you think is the most likely outcome you take it a drop by more than 50 million yeah okay it'll drop by less than 50 minutes which gives somebody else is to pay by the pain right who's the only other player to Bear the paint the bondholders will they want to pay the paint no but I'll drag them in anyway he said I don't want to be part of this no too late in fact here's what I did I took my option pricing model and replaced only one input right I still have the same debt outstanding the standard deviation stays the same it's a business it's half the business the percentage standard deviation but I replace the 100 million with the 50 million I value the option and what I get as the value of my Equity is 30.44 it's absolutely right my value dropped by 45 and a half million but by only 45 and a half million who's the other player of the game the debt holder dropped four and a half men in and if I solve for an interest rate now it's going to be 14 and a half or 15 percent but take a look at nd2 it was remember it was um this number was 63 before this happened it's now 42 the chance of bankruptcy went from 37 to 58 percent effectively when company value drops you're going to get this redistribution of what happened as well between equity investors and lenders which means you can't go directly from value drop to 50 million your Equity won't drop by 50 million as well once I got started on this I could not stop myself I wanted to see when Equity would become religious so I kept the took the remember I went from 100 to 50 equities still hanging in there I made it 40 then I made it 30 then I made it 20 then I made it 10. I could not make the equity value go away I made the value of the business 5 million and the ACT it's a basket case company right it owes it has an 80 million dollar zero coupon Bond outstanding what's keeping the equity afloat here time and variance right you need both as your ally you've got 10 years and you say please God let something good happen in the next 10 years this is why deeply troubled companies often continue it puzzles people why would people buy shares in Bed Bath and Beyond everybody knows it's a basket case you're absolutely right they're not buying it for the same reasons you buy Con Ed you buy Facebook you're buying it what is Liquidation option yes then I think flash me out to a 10-year coupon Bond what's going to happen to this option you have 10 one-year options so the the structure of thinking stays the same it just means that you have a one-year call option followed by another it's actually a very mess instead of options because each options value is a functional whether the previous option stays alive it can be done the so the thought process stays the same it just gets a lot Messier when you have deadlier I'm going to give you a simplistic way of getting around that but you're right this 10 year zero coupon is a complete artifact right what troubled company is one nice zero coupon 10-year bond outstanding or at your bond outstanding it does make the thinking cleaner here because it keeps that issue off but if you have 10 if you have a regular 10 year bond think of it as a series of one-year options yes so the company is a very high betas would be good um would be good candidates for high standard deviation because remember beta's measurably Market risk so you now want to go to Total risk because everything that causes the company to move now becomes part of it and that actually is an interesting thing if you're going to buy equity in a troubled company make it a don't make it a nice safe travel company I don't even know what that means but if a company says look I can guarantee you I will lose 100 million every year for the next 10 years this is not a good candidate you want to put your equity in deeply troubled risky companies because that's the only way you get out from underwater to above orders you would need a huge volatility and firm value to come apart yes absolutely commercial real estate I think operates like an option but real estate prices drop people will swoop in and buy the equity for fractions and often they will have to write it off if Equity doesn't pick up but I mean that optionality kicks in any time you have a highly levered business where the value I mean historically real estate values have not been that volatile but the more volatile they get that Leverage is going to have that optionality kick in but it does mean that if you lend money to a levered firm for God's sakes protect your interest because as the equity investor in The Firm I can take advantage of you in fact I'm going to use this to kind of illustrate how conflicts of interest can play out you got a value by Equity remember so let's go back pre-catastrophe here's the value of equity 75.94 value so I'm going to come to you with a project you're the manager of the firm you cater to the equity investors I come to you with approach and I want to sell you the product so I start by describing the project it's a negative net present value of minus two minute what's your first reaction get out of here I said no no wait but it's a negative Net Present Value project which has a huge amount of risk let's get this is going from bad to us right in fact if you take this project the standard deviation of your company will go from 40 to 50 so I want you to take a bad risky project this violates every precept in corporate finance right what do you think will happen to the value of equity in this company if I take this project something like it should go down terribly risky project well I I decided to check it out I took the value of the firm 100 million taking the negative Net Present Value project will lower the 100 million to 98 million so they think this is bad news I still have the 80 million dead outstanding I've now increased the standard deviation to 50 so 0.5 squared is 0.25 and the riskless rate is still 10 percent you remember what the value of equity was before I took this bad risky project this is Magic with 75.94 it's now gone to 77.71 but it's not quite I've just stolen enough money for my bondholders to cover the negative Net Present Value and make things worse don't feel sorry for the lenders in this case the warning sign I get as a letter is when you lend money to a highly levered firm you have to assume they can rip you off you got to put in protections which means that that project that comes up you have to have a lender's representative sitting in there with the veto power saying no you cannot take that risky project because you're ripping us off I'm always amazed at banks that lend money on lbos as passive lenders I mean what possesses you to think that this is going to work out in your best interest what's good for Equity investors and what's good for lenders doesn't converge and this is a classic way of illustrating how the two can diverge yes sir I was not the CEOs um stock options the version of this where the more received it is a company that's that's part of the problem I've infected everybody get the point which is remember when people were given options and they were told this will match incentives up it doesn't quite right because options are driven not just by the value of the stock but the variance in that value whereas you as a shareholder want a nice stable value so that can actually induce CEOs to take riskier Investments and they should because they can benefit from the risk with their optional audits that's why I'm glad that we've shifted away as much as we have from management options restricted stock you don't have that Clash anymore but anytime you talk about options risks switches from being a bad to a good and that can alter the way you make decisions yes Lisa it's a residual claim and the limited liability that's what's making you so daring right you know if you are underwater does it let you know does it matter whether you drown in 16 feet of water at 35 feet of water that's basically it I mean no bed bath that Beyond CEO is saying let me take the cautious view here they're going to put everything on the table because what do they have to lose they're going to go bankrupt anyway this just means it's a subject it's a small chance of making it out of there so it's a residual claim and the limited liability that essentially makes equity in mistakes Digger and bigger risk because you have less and less to lose the further you get towards zero okay and that's why with very highly levered companies you got to be careful about incentives because what's good for the equity investors that can definitely not be good for the rest of the players in the game we've supplied 90 of the capital now that we're breaking traditional Corporate Finance rules because now is it take negative Net Present Value projects let's stay on that theme hey let's assume your uh your manager or company today we're going to talk about Acquisitions so you're this so the firm that we just valued 75.94 million Equity decides to buy another firm which is valid at 150 million they pay a fair value what's a conventional wisdom of what will happen to your stock price when you pay fair value nothing should change right zero Net Present Value let's see if that's in fact True by playing this out so you're this poor mate that we just valued there's firm B that you're acquiring at fair value the two have standard deviations that are different there are different businesses remember though what happens to the firm when you combine it right if there are different businesses you get that variance in the portfolio equation so this looks uh foreign it's just the two asset portfolio so you now have two companies and two businesses coming together the combined company is going to be safer for the simple reason you you've removed some of the firm specific risks that's going to have consequences you make the combined company safer who you think about the two players in the game equity and debt who wins and who loses the debt holders win when you have a safer company and Equity investors lose when you have a safe for companies in the options perspective so here's how it plays out 75.94 million was the value of the equity in in in in for May 134.47 well it was valued by putting for a b fairly valued the combined company the value of equity I get is about three million dollars lower and that's a direct consequence again of a transfer wealth away from Equity investors lender so this is the flip side of what we saw in the previous section you're a conglomerate you keep buying other companies and other businesses and if you keep the existing lenders essentially protected they're going to gain because you're creating a safer company and they now have interest rates were set based upon a riskier businesses that will give them a benefit is there a way you can claw back some of those benefits if you're this is the manager of this company and you're this conglomerate what are the two ways you can claw back some of this wealth distribution one is borrow more money right when you do Acquisitions borrow more money that effectively you do it the other is put in go into the to the lenders and essentially I said look this is a safer company I know and if they refuse remember much of U.S debt can be repaid in advance right there's no restrictions in repaying in advance you repay that debt replace it with new debt at a lower interest rate but if you don't watch that wealth transfer you can very quickly see it's not big so you don't even notice it seeps away with each acquisition so you can see the construct for valuing Equity but and as you point out I made a lot of very simplistic assumptions to get them I gave you the value of the firm you're saying where the heck what am I going to start with that 100 million I gave you the standard deviation the value you're saying I don't know where I'd get that either I made it 190 coupon Bond when an effect you have dozens and dozens of debt with different maturities and different interest rates so I'm going to try to squeeze Real World Companies through this model and I'm going to make some pragmatic assumptions together so here's what I'm going to do to get the value of the firm I'm going to use my DCF valuation and you already actually have it so if any of you have trouble companies you've done the bulk of the value the DCF value you get for the operating assets becomes the s in the model that's a very big companies are going concern if you don't have time to do a discounted cash flow valuation you can do a liquidation valuation if I sold the pieces or a pricing that becomes the s in the model what would I get if I liquidated the company today but the variance that value if your company is publicly traded you have two numbers out there you can use to come up with the variance not you could use the standard deviation of the stock price that gives you the variance in equity value but you'd also need a bond price variance because it's a variance in firm value rather than just the equity value it's going to be a mess so I'm going to give you a shortcut that I'd use almost every single time remember how we got bottom-up address where we looked at is I compute bottom-up standard deviations in value by sector so if you gave me a troubled Steel company rather than me going getting the stock price and the steel company the bond price and playing this little gymnastics game what the standard deviation value would be I go to the standard deviation of steel companies and firm value and use that as my standard deviation saves you a lot of time and actually gives you a better estimate because you're not using this you know these Equity that might be incredibly volatile because of the danger the companies but the value of the debt here's what I'm going to cheat I'm going to take all of your debt outstanding I'm going to gather it all into one big lump sum one year dead three you're dead five you're dead and then I'm going to take a weighted average if I can the durations of each of the debt but if I'm in a hurry the weighted average maturity and come up with the weight you see what I'm trying to do right I'm going to try to take all of your messages and replace it with one equivalent zero coupon Bond cheating absolutely the alternatives are too terrified in terms of the option pricing challenges I would face that's going to give me pretty much everything I need for a real company that'll allow me to apply the option pricing model it's not going to apply this on a company it's an old example I should probably update with one of the airlines today is a valuation I did of Euro tunnel you heard of Euro tunnel it's a tunnel in the ground where cash goes in but never seems to come out you know essentially connecting the England and France so it was built with the best of hope that this would somehow make money okay so I did a valuation so at the time that I valued your return I first wanted to make sure to meet the criteria for an option pricing model first was losing money he was losing lots and lots of money and it lost so much money that it's Book value of equity had turned negative so that's a sign that it's not just losing money for one year it's been losing money for a long time so it's a money loser with a long history so one half of my requirements are met almost nine billion dollars in debt outstanding no and it's spread out all over the place was not a nice zero coupon Bond so the distribution of debt there's the debt there's the face value the debt I computed the duration but as I said it used to maturity it's not a big deal so it's a money losing company it's continuing to lose money it has a huge amount of debt I know an option pricing model is going to help me here so first thing I did was I closed off my the option pricing model did a traditional discounted cash flow evaluation and I built in the usual way you deal with the money losing company I fix the margins over time no recovery built in the value that I got was 2.3 billion what's the outstanding that remind me again nine billion my discounted cash flow evaluation with the company assuming it makes it back to health is 2.3 billion this is a deep out of money option foreign I need a variance in firm value here because your tunnel was so unique in 1997 I left the luxury of doing an industry average today I would I would use infrastructure companies and use that so in 1997 I actually looked up the stock the standard deviation in Euro tunnel stock price was 41 and eurotunnels bond price which is 17 so basically I looked at the traded shares of bonds if that equation again looks weird it's just a weight because I'm now creating a portfolio composed of 15 eurateral equity and 85 Euro tunnel bonds that was the debt ratio the standard deviation I get in firm values .0335 the 15-year bond rate was about six percent which works out the duration of a 15-year bond is roughly 11 years which works out to be the weighted duration of the debt that I had everything I need there's a value of my underlying asset 2.3 billion face value of my dead 8.9 billion D part of the money option but I knew that was coming one advantage I have is the debt is really really long term so even though I have some short-term debt the bulk of the debt is long term I have 10.93 years to play this game maybe the Sultana Brunei will say I like a tunnel will you name it after me and paid four times as I said it's built on a hope in a prayer that somebody will come along or something is going to change fundamentally what's the likelihood of default here 92 and a half percent there's a set look at the ndy nd2 is always so there's a seven and a half percent chance that the company will make it back above value which means there's a 92 and a half percent check no surprise again right you looked at the debt you saw that was coming but here's the miracle everybody creates a deeply distressed company this is in fact the perfect prototype for a basket case company Miracle of options the value the equity is 122 million why am I paying 122 million because I have 10.93 years but Something Good Can Happen and if that happens who knows what the value of equity could become so as you watch Airlines go in and out of bankruptcy and you watch as shares continue to trade even as they're bankrupt I mean I you could have bought Continental Airlines shares in 1993 for 23 cents a share three years later it was worth fifty two dollars per share that's the kind of payoff so if you buy a lot of trouble companies and ninety percent of the companies what's going to happen you're going to lose what you paid for the company it's a very skewed distribution the six or the seven and the eight percent of your companies that actually come back deliver such huge returns that they hopefully make up for the so it's called vulture investing basically you know people have done this well where you focus in on trouble companies you buy a portfolio of trouble companies and then you hope that the winners carry your entire portfolio and why would you just buy a cool option on your account because call options run out in three months or six months right you need you need time if you are able to buy long-term call options on these you could unfortunately these are exactly the kinds of companies we are not going to get long-term call options or leads but it's a mindset that basically again even if you never apply an option pricing model to Value equity in a company I want to think about that line that gets crossed when a company goes from being viewed as a going concern to being treated as an option it's a big change right because then you're betting on risk becoming your ally rather than an enemy everything starts to shift in terms of how you think about investing and valuing those companies and I said brick and mortar retail if you go past the the top five or six healthy names right target Walmart you go below that you're looking at basically options Airlines 90 of Airlines around the world are essentially you're buying options you're not buying them for the same reasons and for some of you value trouble companies you know trouble getting your DCF value to exceed your debt and so what do I do this might be a last shot of actually getting a positive value for Equity is its trading as an option any questions so I want to start on Acquisitions and now the title kind of gives away what I think about Acquisitions about um 20 years ago you know old student of mine ended up setting up this executive seminar series that was his business Iran executive seminar so he's right he ran an executive seminar for CFOs of Syrian acquires that's that you know for like these are companies that do Acquisitions every month like a book of the month club they do an acquisition of the month see it we gathered them together in New York and he calls me and he says would you be willing to come and talk to this group and I said are you sure you got the right guy you know what I think about Acquisitions right he said no no I know exactly where you're going to come from but for the rest of the day they're going to hear from Bankers you know what Bankers think about Acquisitions right it's a mother's milk of all deal making it's always great and he said you can be the antidote I said give me the last 30 minutes and I'll do it and I'm going to give you the the session that I gave these acquirers because I made these CFOs a deal I said look I'm going to take you through a series of seven very basic fundamental tests on Acquisitions and if you fail on more than two of the tests I'd like you to stop doing Acquisitions none of them took me up on the deal but I for those any of you planning to be an m a up to you okay so Lisa can be one of the candidates for the seven per seven level tests and if you fail more than two would you be willing to switch jobs and go into something else probably not right so so don't make it explicit this you can always change your answer and make it right if you get the wrong answer so let's start by setting the table there are two players in an acquisition there's the acquiring firm and there's the target firm I know all the attention goes in the acquiring firm you know pay attention but the reality is there's just as much action happening in the Target foot so one of the things you can look at is what the stock prices of acquiring in Target firms do around the date of the acquisition and this shouldn't come as a surprise on the date of the acquisition there's one group that's very happy the shareholders in the Target verb in the other group which is always feeling a little mixed about what just happened because an average at least acquiring firm shareholders don't seem to share the sports the game seems tilted in favor of Target company shareholders public to public companies we'll talk about public to private public to public companies if there's a winner in the game it's clearly the shareholders of the target company it's not shared as a requirement of course if you ask the managers of the acquiring company about this what's their response because they were supposed to take care of their shareholders right their response is the market doesn't see what we see we have we have access to details we've done this research and part of that is true right managers do know more about the insides of the acquisition than shareholders do but they're one fatal flaw which is they're incapable of being objective you're part of a deal it becomes very difficulty it's got nothing to do with being dishonest you convince yourself there is synergy you convince yourself because you've been spending so much time in the deal that so if you ask them they just said just wait because if manages the right what should happen five years later when you look at these deals the acquiring company should have gained you should have seen an increase in value and if you look at the evidence on post acquisition results so these are studies that McKinsey does KPMG does following up five years or ten years up to the deal McKenzie actually asked very simple questions did the return on Capital invested in the acquisition exceed the cost of capital that question sound familiar it's a question we've been asking all through about any project that should be true about big deals as well did the Acquisitions help the parent companies outperform the peer group because you're telling me that there's some Synergy it should show up in our performance half of all the programs they look at fail at least when and many fail both tests so that is a very early Mackenzie strike KPMG in the 1990s did a study where they looked at almost 6 000 Acquisitions around the world with a singular question that one word Synergy that keeps getting used over and over what percentage of mergers actually deliver on Synergy because the combined firms earnings should go up relative to the Standalone firms and they found that one in six mergers deliver synergy about two and six deliver nothing which leaves a half of companies where they actually found negative Synergy we say what's negative Synergy two companies come together the combined company somehow manages to underperform the two companies standing alone so much promised no benefit from Synergy doesn't seem to manifest so looking both at the day of the acquisition and after the merger there is very little evidence that doing Acquisitions actually benefit shareholders of acquiry companies you know bad news the disease is spreading what do I mean by this most of these studies review as companies but in the 20 30 40 years ago we looked at Target companies you're acquiring companies in developed markets Target companies we're in Emerging Markets so Indian companies Chinese companies usually Target companies the worm has stood right now you have Indian companies acquiring UK companies or U.S companies and when you look at those companies you seem to see the same kind of evidence you saw with the U.S acquires play out when you look at Chinese acquirers Indian acquirers there's something fundamentally wrong here because it replicates across markets across acquisitions so one of the questions of course is is you know is this a is this the process by which we do acquisition is there a flaw in the process and there clearly is Right much of the word how do Acquisitions work here an acquiring company there's a Target company both hire bankers and then the rest is lost right because those Bankers have one objective which is what to get the deal done and it's not because they're bad people that's how they get paid right that's the way we we've set up the incentive structure because if one of the bankers comes to you and says don't do the steel it doesn't make sense they get nothing so we've created a process that's going to make it more likely that bad deals go through or any deal goes through once the deal process gets started so if we look at the collective evidence the target companies paid too much they don't get the benefits they claim to get there's something wrong with the process now what I'd like to do is talk about how that skewed process plays out in bad choices when it comes to valuation I would never Teach an m a class because I'd run out of stuff to say after session one right it's because to me I'm not interested the deal making part because I'm not that good at it and I don't care much about it to me the essence of an acquisition is a good acquisition is one where you pay less than what you get back as value a bad acquisition is one where you pay too much so let's talk about the structural causes for why Acquisitions historically have had such trouble delivering value and these are the seven tests so Lisa be ready because the tests are going to come at you first test is what I call risk transfers acquiring company Target company what discount rate should you use we've talked about this already we'll talk about how risk transference is a big factor in why bad Acquisitions go through second is because I call the debt subsidy game which is when you compute the cost of capital use on an acquisition you use the acquiring company's cost of debt you're already loading the dice in favor of the target company shareholders if they're risky if the target company is a risky company so we'll see how that plays out the third is this magical word control remember the first session I added up the word control and we talked about 20 I wasn't being facetious it's amazing how people add percentages to prices for control without a clear sense of what exactly control isn't what they're paying then I want to zero in on the word Synergy after all it's a one big word in acquisitions and if your question is can Synergy bet be valued it better be valued because you just paid for it if you're paying for something and you tell me you can't value it we're in deep trouble so we're going to talk about how to Value synergy and what types of synergy are more likely to deliver value let's say different kinds of synergy fifth is like everything else M A is about pricing and often pricing is based on a multiple and comparable she's saying what's different about m a i think the m a pricing process is even more screwed up than the typical pricing process because the way in which we come up with comparables and the multiples we end up using Sixth and I think this is a big factor like before we blame the bankers we have to recognize that when CEOs of companies go to a banker and say should I do this deal they're not asking for advice it's like that old Jack Nicholson movie right you'll say to a Few Good Men please understand and he's asked you know what is you don't care I mean what do you say you don't we don't hear the truth I I don't remember the exact words I saw Jack Nicholson on the Lakers Sidelines yesterday man is old now so you know but we're all getting older as well but no but but many cases CEOs don't want to hear the truth they don't want to hear that the deal doesn't make sense they want affirmation so before we blame Bankers for all the bad stuff we don't talk about CEO Egos and how they drive some bad deals and finally I think that to me the most troubling part of the m a process is how nobody seems to be held accountable when a deal falls apart or deal goes bad and you lose billions of dollars you take a bad project you lose 50 million you get fired you do a bad acquisition you cost 50 billion nobody's you get promoted it seems it's a very strange process so I think all of those come into play so let's and so you we can get so you can keep tabs for yourself I won't check on you as we go through each test as to whether you're passing the test because my now you have all the ammunition to need to ask the right valuation questions that make the right valuation judgments yes how would you do an acquisition I would tell me in transaction terms how you pull that off right stocks at 50. I try to buy your shares at 45 who's going to 10 to the shares that's different though Credit Suisse the stock price is already done right by the time the actual transaction happened there was no stock price like today there's no First Republic stock price it'll be zero today right so I think that that's you you could never do a transaction at below the stock price in this case you can you know these are not traditional mergers JPMorgan is not doing a traditional acquisition of First Republic it's picking up pieces we don't even know what the specifics of the deal are and for the moment we have no idea whether this is a good deal or a bad deal for JPMorgan shareholders my guess is that they will walk away with the good deal and leave the FB you know keep the residue for somebody else pick up probably taxpayers to pick up but we'll see no yeah so let's let's try each of these sets so it said no today you notice there was no start of the class test because today's class is all going to be a series of tests and I'm going to keep the numbers simple yeah so you're an acquiring firm I come to you with the target firm let's keep the target firm very simple it's got revenues of 100 million operating expenses of 80 million operating income of 20 million after tax operating income of 12 million I'm going to assume this company has zero growth in perpetuity what does it get you when you have zero growth you don't have to reinvest money so your after tax operate income becomes your free cash flow I'm trying to keep the examples you're not doing a reinvestment rate so your cash flows every year are going to be 12 million a year right so you your depreciation capex all of that kind of goes to zero so you get 12 million in cash flows every year in perpetuity let's say the cost of equity for this company is 20 it's all equity for debt so you got 12 million cash flows every year in perpetuity your cost of equity is 20 what's the value of this company forget about the acquisition part of the product we haven't even come to that what's the value of this company 60 million right 12 million divided by 0.260 million file that away because I'm now going to try to convince you to pay more than 60 million that's my job in an acquisition to convince you to be so here's my first try I said look you're a safer business your cost of equity is only 10 percent you see what I'm going to take you right what am I trying to get you to do take the 12 million and use your company's cost of equity of 10 which will make the value of the target for magically 120 value acquiring companies cost of equity you're a safe company will push up the value of the target company for all the wrong reasons the target company didn't become more valuable you've effectively subsidized the target Company by applying your cost of equity to the Target company so when you think about looking at Target companies the point I made early with the congoleum example it's always the target company's risk characteristic that should drive the discount rate for the Target company rather than the acquiring companies because if you use the acquiring company's cost of equity you can see how this is going to play out it's going to play out like a T and T in the 1990s but they kept buying technology company after technology company because they kept looking cheap to ATT you know why they look cheap right 8080 at a really low cost of equity they would take a software company which had twice the cost of equity that looks amazing that looks amazing that looks amazing and after all these amazing deals ATT was almost bankrupt so how did that happen G did a variant of the same thing where they applied G's cost to Capital acquisition after acquisition without factoring in that they were buying and he's saying on the mistakes average out they won't right because they're always going to cut in One Direction because when you try to value a safer company to your cost of equity you're going to find that they're unreachable all the riskier companies are going to look cheap to you that's risk subsidization yes Berkshire Hathaway Berkshire Hathaway doesn't do first a lot of acquisition many of them are smaller companies most of their Investments are in publicly traded companies as just Holdings right so 90 of bookshare's value doesn't come from buying See's candy or it comes from their Holdings Coca-Cola and the Washington Post so the bulk of Berkshire Hathaways is in publicly traded companies in the private businesses that they buy they're often Private Business they're not publicly traded companies so their Acquisitions often are a very specific types of companies that go into it and they tend to be safe companies you're not buying risky businesses so if they're screwing up by using the cost of capital the range of mistakes you can make tend to get smaller because you stay with mature safe for businesses okay so they're screwing up it's on some other dimension it's not on this one so everybody comfortable with that notion because Lisa you're going to have to fight this fight because when you get out there in m a it's amazing how often the acquiring companies cost of equity and cost of capital like will get used in valuation and you have to be able to explain the consequences of doing this over time because that's the only way I get it because otherwise it's just one deal in fact G's argument I actually you know it's a G's headquarters a long time ago and they were actually a healthy company and I had a headquarters do they have one still maybe they do so this was in Stanford they come out all the GE divisional heads are there and I talk about Eminem and I did this session and I get to this part and I look at the room and I say you guys don't do this do you they all look at each other and they say we do but it's okay here so what do you mean it's okay here they said we're so big and they're so small it probably doesn't make a difference I said if I took a Krispy Kreme donut and cut into 24 pieces and ate all 24 how many calories do you think I'll get you take 24 bad deals you add them all up it becomes one really bad deal right but they felt no qualms about saying no we just want to Costa Capital we're a big company so it's a fight that needs to be fought because it's to me it's one of the it's a cardinal sin in any kind of valuation yes sir we know when private investor looks the public company that Capital they have less uh domestication if I am bargaining for if I'm bidding for a public company and there's a public bidder I will never be able to pay the price they do well I thought you would look at the other side which is if you have a private business which thinks of its cost of equity based on total beta public company looking at the same company we'll see only and that's one of the reasons why public companies acquiring private businesses remain a place where there's value to be gained on both sides right because a seller is not Diversified and the buyer is Diversified he can actually split the difference and walk away Happy from the table it's always the target companies aren't level beta that I start with the only difference is because is how I use the correlation to get up with it so it's actually added less the same point because it seemed like a violation of the rule of it's always the target companies carrying it's still the target company but the way you see the target company's risk is different depending on potential buyers and that's what makes your private business valuation buyer specific let's talk about cost debt let's say you're as acquiring company have access to really cheap debt you're a highly rated company you can borrow money after taxes at four percent so let's have convinced you to use the target company's cost of equity of 20 but now you plan to raise half the money to do the acquisition from that you're the acquiring company at four percent you can see how this logic is going to drive you right what do we do in the cost of capital we take ratio debt and Equity so it looks like 50 50. and you know I know we're supposed to level the beta non-leverage so but let's leave the cost of equity at 20 percent I now have debt at four percent fifty fifty I'm going to end up with a costly capital of 12 in the middle right and I put a 12 cost of capital that 60 million dollar company will become a hundred million dollar company so it's pretty reasonable right I have borrowing money at a low rate I'm able to borrow a lot of money so why shouldn't I use that low cost of debt and that debt ratio in my cost and capital calculations yes the response it's I'm giving a 40 million dollar premium to the Target company shareholders right why because I have a high rating which I heard by doing what by running my company really carefully for the last 100 years I am rewarding the target company shareholders for something that they're zero role in creating I'm subsidizing I know it sounds counterintuitive but the fact that you can borrow a lot of money at a really low rate shouldn't allow you to pay a higher price for a Target company because then the target company shareholders are essentially reaping the benefits of something that they had absolutely no role in creating you see what can I do let's say the target company could actually borrow 20 on its own they chose not to borrow money let's say they could have borrowed that money at six percent why they're a risky company I'm okay Computing a cost to Capital using that 20 debt ratio and the six percent cost debt because that would be a Target company debt ratio it wouldn't be something where I'm allowing the target company to get subsidized because it's part of GE think of GE at its peak Triple A rated company able to borrow money at three or three and a half percent going around using that in costly Capital calculations to buy Target companies that are much riskier and you can see the subsidization play out over time so not only should you use the target companies unleavened beta level beta for the cost of equity you should also be careful the news debt ratios and the cost of capital value Target companies that those debt ratios are not artificially pushed up because you have access to debt at a really low cost any questions on the course today let's talk about control previews that twenty percent that I threw out here I'll give you the background for where the 20 comes from there's actually a database called merger stat that takes into kind of every acquisition that happens in the U.S we have access to it I think as you know as you have access to it as as MBA students it's not it has every acquisition in the U.S that twenty percent is actually the average premium or the median premium as I said that companies pay so it's a pre the price paid in an acquisition relative to the market price so that's a premium that's you know propagated across all acquisitions if I do that what effectively am I doing on every acquisition I'm assuming the average is right that people don't overpayer and everything they pick which are actually Cuts against what we started this session with right the acquisition's generally overpriced but even if I buy into the fact that Acquisitions are correctly priced remember that premium includes not just control it includes Synergy and all the other stuff how the heck do you just take the entire premium and so that's control and then on top of that ad Synergy and all the other stuff it's a recipe for double Counting so let's step back and think about what the true value of control is I'll come back and talk more about this on Wednesday remember the target company at a 20 margin so the operating margin was like you know they were earning or 20 million on top on on on a hundred million dollar Revenue let's suppose you think you can run the target company better why you think they're inefficient that their equipment is old you think that if you run the company the margin would be 30 percent how would you value the target company just take the 20 margin replace with 30 60 million will become 90 million right that 30 million is a value control would you pay the entire amount as a premium on the acquisition If You Did You Know What You've Done Right you've given the target company shareholders all the benefits the hard work you're going to put in for cutting costs so this were a true acquisition you know discussion or debate you wanted to preserve some of it not only would you have to compute how much the value of synergy is you then have to have a discussion of who gets what share of that because somebody's bringing more to the an escape and control who's doing the work the problem though is if you end up in a bidding war it's all control I can almost predict where you're going to end up you're going to end up at 90 million because they're going to play you off against each other but control has nothing to do with two companies coming together it's the fact that the target companies badly managed to badly right and you're paying a premium because you think you can run the company better which also means that if the companies put the target company is perfectly managed perfectly right don't be paying any control premiums because there's nothing to be changed by how that companies run so I would argue in general if you see rules of thumb and Acquisitions be very skeptical because these rules of Dharma created across hundreds of Acquisitions across very different sectors and the premiums reflect all kinds of factors going in including stupidity because remember when a company overpays where does it go it goes into that premium so it's something that you need to think about whenever you see a rule of thumb up this is okay because so don't use the acquiring company's cost of equity be careful not to subsidize the target company because you have cheap debt and access to debt be wary by control I'm not saying don't pay for control but if there is control you have to start to become explicit what am I going to what cost am I going to cut no is that feasible and then play it out as a higher value let's at least set up the discussion of synergy the essence of synergies two companies come together and the combined company is able to do stuff that the individual companies could not have done as Standalone companies let me repeat that again Synergy is not just higher growth and higher earnings because you can get that by just targeting the running the target company better it's something that the combined company can do that could not be done as Standalone companies so when you look at Synergy it has to either show up as higher cash flows for the combined company or a lower discount rate and I'll make a statement I'll try to back this up most of the time it has to be in the numerator so when companies talk about having lower discount rates after the fact I'm skeptical and here's why these were both publicly traded companies right you combine two publicly traded companies there's really no benefits you get as investors from reducing risk because you could have done it yourself these two companies could have been in your portfolio 50 other companies so most of the Synergy is going to show up in the cash flows the question is what form does it show so what I'd like to do and actually with Synergy again you've got to ask a question how much belongs to me how much because you're both needed for the Synergy to draw so I'll give you the big picture page of all of the different ways Synergy can show up Synergy broadly speaking can be either operating Synergy or financial synergy what's operating strategy operating strategy shows up as higher Revenue growth higher margins cost cutting so let's look at the different versions of operating Synergy economies of scale what kind of merges you're most likely to see that two companies in the same business come together the argument is there can be economies of skip the global Brewery bought Modelo Mexican broads before the the sap merger their argument is we can come into Modelo and because we're a big beer company we can reduce their distribution costs we can make the marketing cost go to zero and it worked they're able to actually cut operating expense by 30 percent that's the easiest form of synergy to Value because it's right now it's concrete you can show it as lower operating expenses higher operating income valued right away so economies of scale the other type of operating synergies I'm going to broadly classify strategic Synergy synergies show up as higher growth a better return on investment in capital so essentially it's going to show up in the in your growth numbers and here are the different ways you can show up maybe you can as a combined company on higher returns and capital on your projects anywhere if it has independent copies of scale benefit also results higher it could you know it could so that that could actually but the question is is a one-time cut in which case you know you've got to be careful that you don't build it and it's changing the margin returning Capital but it could that higher return on Capital if you can preserve it on new breweries that you build will show up as higher return on Capital and higher growth rate you're right it could do provide double benefits to you it could also show up as a higher reinvestment rate Maybe by combining two companies you're able to find more products a classic example is develop Market brand name company buying and Emerging Market brand name company we're saying look that's a big Market we can now sell both our products much bigger much bigger much more reinvestment it can also show up as various entry that are much more difficult for competitors to get over by combining these two companies just don't let the justice department know that this is your rationale because this is explicitly the reason that Acquisitions get shut down but implicitly you might say We'll become a stronger company that'll allow us to earn higher returns for a longer period in effect I'm looking for numbers that I use in valuation all the time because I need to make it explicit I would love to tell you that most of the synergies and merges or operating synergies but in my view most of the synergies are Financial synergies and the most common Financial Synergy is the Synergy that you never ever mention in polite company which is we're going to save taxes I should remember in 2016 fisa came up with this convoluted way of buying Allergan which is a UK based company because they wanted to switch their headquarters to the UK and Escape what they felt at that time was a very unfair tax law in the US but they would be taxed at a global the U.S tax rate on global income and everybody knew this was driven by taxes so fisa's CEO gets up on CNBC and he says the primary reason for this is to save taxes my reaction was are you out of your mind because you knew exactly what was coming right after that like waving a red flag in front of the tax guy said come and get me and every politician woke up attack and the deal actually broke down almost immediately so if your primary reason is to save on taxes you know what you should do right use every weapon of mass distraction you have to talk about strategic investments in China that always helps no or real options are artificial intelligence throw everything as a distraction when all you're saying is I'm going to save on taxes see how can combining two companies save on taxes it could be as simple as a money-making company by the money losing company in the average job though that's become more and more difficult over time the IRS has become very clear on you can't combine two companies without meeting these criteria could also be things like being able to write up the book value of assets because you're sometimes allowed to do that get more depreciation afterwards and there are quotes in some countries tax laws that actually benefit companies or Acquisitions I'll give you an example in Brazil you know you know how interest expenses are tax deductible right so by 30 40 years ago the Brazilian government decided for the best of reason that they wanted to give Equity an advantage to a tax advantage so in Brazil you're allow this line item called interest on Capital it's the strangest lineup when you look at what the heck is that you're allowed to take your book equity and take a percentage that book Equity as a tax deduction and the government would say 12 so the number is specified by the government so you see what you have an incentive to do right you want to make your book Equity higher for a long time it explained why Brazil had the lowest price to book ratios of companies around the world it's not because they were cheap but Brokers Brazilian companies unlike the rest of the world we have an incentive lower Book value and an incentive to push it up you're saying how does this help in emerges the minute after you do a merger you know what happens your book values right they go especially because you bring in another company so I'm going to use ambev which was the original Brazilian company that 3G capital is in control of and they bought when they bought in web so the original merger I was an invest shareholder and I remember waiting for the benefits of the great it's great to be brought up in an acquisite because Amber was the target company and I and one of the things that happened in that merger was that almost 80 percent of the Synergy that merger came from writing up interest on Capital it's the the book value job I never got the benefits you know why because I own the non-boarding shirts they actually set up the deal in such a way that 80 percent of the the premium paid in the merger went to the voting shareholders a reminder if you needed one as to why corporate governance matters and why not being able to vote makes a difference especially when you have big transactions like this so that's tax savings there are two other potential Financial synergies in corporate finance we talk about companies having optimal debt relations right we computed based on dead Clips I know your earnings and your variance in earnings let's save two companies which have optimal debtorations 20 are and are at the optimum combining the two companies can sometimes push up your optimal debt ratio especially if they're in different businesses because you create a combined firm that's safer your optimal debt ratio might go from 20 to 30 that increase in debt capacity is also a financial benefit again it's a wealth transfer from taxpayers to a company but you can see taxes you know the debt ratios go up and finally with private companies there is this benefit you get from just diversify do you see why your private company owner what's your what's your baby you have a total beta right which is the market made by correlation as you diversify what happens to that correlation it starts to move towards one so One Reason family group companies if you look at them in Asia and Latin America which have been around a long time will be in every conceivable business it was their way of dealing with this diversification risk before markets became accessible is by being no public companies it doesn't make sense private companies it does yes well I think two technology technology companies come together first it's got to be a company in two different businesses you get the greatest benefit because think in terms of portfolio diversification right the lower the correlation between two companies the greater the savings you're going to get by combining the two so if you look at conglomerate mergers which is where the the most successful you'll actually see the debt ratio rise this is the kind of the counter to the option example they'll actually push up the debt ratio as they get more and more Diversified as conglomerate so take some historic like Gulf and Western track them over time the debt ratio actually climbs as they go from one business to two business to three businesses because effectively they become mutual funds at some point in time so those are the potential synergies so let's talk about valuing Synergy in a merger to Value Synergy and emerge you've got to go through three steps first you got to Value the acquiring firm and the target firm as Standalone entities let me repeat that again you can never value Synergy by just looking at the Target company it's impossible to do so the next time a banker gets up it says a valued Synergy and all they have is the target company no that's not the way this it works you have to Value the acquiring company the target companies Standalone companies step two just add those two values up you know what that's going to give you right it's going to Value give the value the combined company there's no Synergy if you just because values are added step three take the combined company and throw in every conceivable benefit that you think you can get cost savings higher growth lower cost of capital higher debt ratio go to you know go to town with it to take the combined company and if you're right what should happen in step three what do you get is a value the combined company should be greater than what you got in step two which is the value of the two companies standing in that difference is the value of synergy and it also allows you to ask the question what if I have to wait three years of five years for Synergy to show up you can see why that can happen right you combine two companies it can take a while to integrate you can take the present so you have the Mechanics for valid synergy so let's take a couple of examples of synergy so you can see this player about 20 years ago Procter and Gamble at that time the largest consumer product company in the world but Gillette six largest huge consumable it was driven primarily by talk of synergy so I decided I wanted to Value Synergy in this deal so I'm going to keep it simple there's my Procter Gamble evaluation of equity there's my Gillette valuation Equity I value them as Standalone companies 221 billion about 60 billion what's the value of the combined company I'm going to call it piglet that's not the Procter Gamble Gillette they actually decide to continue to know why keep the name Procter and Gamble but I thought piglet would have been a good name to pick after that if there were no Synergy the value the combined company should just be the values of the two companies put together I did a best case evaluation of synergy you know I call it the best case I took everything managers said they would do after the merger assumed they would do it and they would do it instantaneously every single part of it is extremely optimistic so they said they could cut operating expense by 250 Millions okay I believe you next year you expect it down 250 million they talked about a slightly higher growth rate and they gave like it had to be a few basis points too largest and the sixth largest you're not going to get a 20 jump in growth rate so with the lower operating expenses the slightly higher growth rate the value that I got for the combined firm is 298 billion there's a Canard that we don't think Synergy has value that's not the case Synergy can have huge value but here's the catch what do I need to compare that Synergy to decide if the deal is a good deal or profit and gamble shareholders what did they pay as a premium they pay the 25 billion dollar preview and this is why I think Acquisitions fail because people tell these big stories about Synergy but they don't want to Value synergy they would use it as a plug bearing look it can explain away what I paid and if you do that you're lost the game is out of your heads because you're going to get into that negotiating table and you're going to keep pushing up the price saying we have Synergy that can make up the difference in fact if you were a thoughtful banker and a banker actually wanted a good deal you'd need this 298 billion the 17 billion in your pocket and you're first trying to negotiate to get some of that 17 billion for yourself your shareholders and if the pricing gets too rich and it gets to 17 billion you know what you need to be able to do walk away from the table the most powerful tool you have to stop bad deals is being able to walk away from Bad deals it's easier said than done because you've invest think of how many weeks or months you've spent putting this year together you feel like a failure right all that wiped out some costs I've spent two years doing this deal what's an extra 8 billion especially if it's not your own money right and that becomes part of the problem is it people don't want to walk away from the table and if you don't want to walk away from the table you're going to end up overpaying videos take a second example tax benefits this was when uh you know Zenith was on its last legs you know Zenith has a long and storied history there was a time when he bought a TV in the U.S Zenith was on it right when was the last time you saw New Zealand's TV I mean at the time that I looked at Zenith for this particular example the only thing that Zenith had a value was accumulated loss it's kind of a sad story as the companies look how many nols we could said so let's suppose that your Best Buy and you're thinking of buying Zenith and you're doing it for a very pragmatic reason you're buying it because you want that nol you have no desire for the name Zenith none of that no fancy stuff and the annual they had is two billion dollars what's uh what's the value of buying in nol what does it do it saves you taxes right so your tax rate is 36 and if you have enough income today to cover it you take 36 percent of 2 billion that's 720 million and that is your value gain but let's say only a half a billion in operating income every year for the next four years you still have the two billion losses but now what will your tax benefits look like it's going to be insert 720 million right now it's going to be 180 million a year right so it's a time value of money what else do you have to worry about the expected operating income is 500 million you have no idea whether you'll actually make it's one of the big questions in valuation is when you have nols that are spread out over time what discount rate should you apply on those animals to bring them back to today remember the rule we came up with when we looked at the pharmaceutical company your cash flow he said take about the risk you face in that cash flow to give you a discard rate what's a risk in your I mean you could argue either for a cost of capital it's your operating income that could be volatile or you could actually argue it's taxable income you have to worry about here because remember it's often interest expenses and use a cost of equity and so you can have this debate about cost of equity Capital but at least you're having a debate about where is the risk coming from the reason I bring this up and a lot of M A valuations on the street I often see annual stake and multiplied by the tax rate and treat it as value today and that's extraordinarily optimistic if you don't have the income to cover today because you're ignoring about the time value of money and the risk that you might never be able to collect on that noer foreign Synergy is a great sounding word I think it can have immense amounts of value but you need to push people in Synergy right what Synergy where is it going to show up and they'll be incredibly evasive because their argument is it's uncertain it's subjected that paid subjective dollars don't pay if you pay real money and you're paying a 25 billion dollar premium you could use it as subjective I can't get my hands around it because you just paid 25 billion for that subjective I can't get my hands around it you've got to force people to be explicit you know what the benefit of that is remember I told you that KPMG founded only one of six companies Synergy shows up they looked at the characteristics of those those deals where Synergy shows up and one one of the other things they found in common across those companies these were companies were plans for Synergy were made before the acquisition people actually made explicit plans and this is what we think we can say and then somebody was held accountable preferably the same guy was pushing so hard for this acquisition give him the advantage of give her the oh you you would want to say then you'd be responsible for all these nice numbers your forecast it's amazing how much more conservative forecasts will become when people realize that they have to actually start to deliver on it because otherwise I mean I've sat in on Bankers pushing up numbers and there's no constraints let's go up 10 or not high enough let's push push up nobody's held account with those numbers why would he ever constrain yourself on how high growth can be or how low cost can get so it's part of that accountability part the process so when we come back on Wednesday I finished the last pieces of the acquisition puzzle but the bug of the mechanical side is already done so think about a big deal in the works Microsoft Activision think about you know what the potential value-added is and how you would put numbers on it it's a good exercise in thinking through what these buzzwords actually mean I'll see you in one second foreign foreign foreign 
um he wants to use the applied um there should be a price per share which is the current market price somewhere around there right so that's just your pricing push here right okay folks good Ed let me into the first topic for today which is your project is due Monday in case you haven't heard already okay a couple of things on the project one is uh once you have your numbers and it's like seven numbers for your company what's your value per share what's your price pricing per share and your recommendation please enter those into the master list right because I will need that for Monday session the second is uh Fiesta I mean I put a page limit on you that seems overwhelmingly tight right it's like four pages per company and if you're wondering how the heck do I summarize a discounted cash flow valuation and get it all done within that page limit here's what won't work if you try to describe to me how you computed a bottom-up levered beta you're dead in the water right because I got the unleavened beta then I went to look at these companies I know how you got the bottom of my Beta so I'm going at this point in time assume that minute you say I used to bottom up Ada I know what you mean but the best way to summarize your discounted casual evaluation is just take a picture of that story page the story worksheet in your spreadsheet or if you've created your own spreadsheet kind of a summary story page because that allows you to tell your story about the company connect them to numbers essentially it takes everything in your DCF and I can see what you've done ever since you can see your growth rate your margins your reinvestment you know what's driving a company it allows you to not have to spend three pages telling me what you're doing and actually does it more effectively because it connects your story to your numbers right there I can say which part of your story so just take a picture don't try to reproduce it on your own that's like six hours of work we try to take each then I'm going to write it out just take the you know take a picture don't just you know with my eyes just don't make it really small no it has to be readable I don't have a magnifying glass so I don't want to be using that so you know if need be keep it as a full page so that you can fit this in rather than compress it into a quarter page okay So today we're going to talk about value so far we've talked about estimating value today's class is about changing value why would you care because if you're a CEO of a company your job is not to estimate value but to increase the value of your company if you're called in as a consultant to a company often it's not to say what's my values to say what can we do to make ourselves more valuable so I'm going to set up that discussion that should come with a few questions the first is I want to draw a contrast between value enhancement and price enhancement we've done this with this big deal about value versus Price Right the question I'm asking as a CEO is do you want to increase prices or do you want to increase value what do you think CEOs really want to increase pricing and that creates a whole lot of contradictions because I'm going to give you a series of actions and I'd like you to tell me whether they affect value and then Hazard of guesses could they affect prices what if I do a stock split what does it do your entrance evaluation Jack Revenue growth margin three investment nothing's changing right you just change the number of units but could a stock split affect your price it often does right why might that be what what aspect of pricing you think it could be psychological which is why one could be psychological which is if a company splits a chairs it must mean it must mean good things are coming the price is going up and you what else liquidity that may be by splitting the shares you're attracting investors I mean remember when Amazon got a two thousand dollars per share the ten for one stocks buying 100 shares at two thousand dollars per share is out of the reach for most people so maybe it's liquidity maybe it's new demand it could affect prices and in fact studies show on average that when you have a stocks but there's an increase in price three to three percent and it's a signaling effect okay what about amortizing Goodwill it's a big deal right you hire these accounting firms to come in on an acquisition they tell you well seven billion dollar write-off and good work terrible news right let's say your company reports tomorrow the Bad Company already valued that the repairing Goodwill by 5 billion will the evaluation change what does impairing good will do it's an acceptance of a mistake you made when not yesterday today it was two years ago five years ago when you did your DCF valuation you saw that mistake play out in the numbers right you saw it play out in the fact that margins go up value is not changed by impairing Goodwill could price change I guess it depends on what the market reaction is if you have a seven billion dollar loss and people say oh my God that's a huge loss and knocked on the price but markets actually seem to be pretty clever on impairment a Goodwill you know the average price impact on Goodwill impairment is zero Because by the time people do it's I knew that already that happened three years ago so you must it leads me wondering why we spent so much time impairing Goodwill and doing all the accounting thing but that trains left the station there's an entire business built on doing it it's not going away what about changing depreciation methods just in your reporting books what does that do when you change your depreciation methods just new reporting books the depreciation we're supposed to be using in free cash for the firm is actually tax depreciation right it's a depreciation that affects your cash flow so if you change your depreciation just to your accounting books you're making your earnings look much better perhaps but your cash flows aren't affected an intrinsic valuation there's no change you're saying who cares you know what your reporting books look like but if I'm reacting as a Trader to earnings per share numbers I might very well push up your stock pricing this is amazing this is not as common with late 90s a lot of companies issued what were called tracking stock I think the New York Times actually had a tracking stock you know in which Division the.com division so what are you trying to do when you do tracking stock I mean it's your overall values of company is the same right you still own it you're trying to take advantage of mood and momentum in a segment of the market if I were Microsoft I would issue AI tracking stock a chat GPT tracking stock could probably take off through the roof even though the overall because tracking stock you're not creating a separate company it's not like a spin-off you take your existing company letting people trade on a piece of the company and you say trust us right because that pieces doesn't have its own board of directors it doesn't have its own earnings report it's an extraordinarily dangerous place to be but you can see how pricing can be affected even though what about changing your name as a company shouldn't affect value right cash flows growth and risk as we'll see when you change names sometimes there's a pricing effect so what I'm trying to say is when people talk about I want to enhance value my first question to them is do you really want to enhance value because that's usually hard work and you've got to change businesses and do things in your business or do you want to enhance prices I could give a couple of cosmetic things you could do and I'll wager more CEOs if you scratch the surface and not interested in value and answer they want to enhance prices take a second question this I think is an interesting question because it cuts Against the Grain or what we're always starting let's say you've now been hired as a CEO of a for business company I've not been particularly creative I've called the divisions a b c and d four different businesses let's suppose I've gone through the hard work of assessing the return in capital and cost to Capital of each of these businesses so returning Capital first business twenty percent caustic so you can see which one's the loser division right it kind of stands out division you now become the CEO and you know the first imperative when you become a CEO is you want to clear the ship you want to divest yourself up which business would you divest as the new CEO I told you Jackie that's what the most common answer you get let's get to the bad business but what is the effect of a divestitution value and how does your value get a as a company when you divest something what it's the difference between the value and the price you get for it right now you see the property it's a loser company business everybody knows it's a loser business including the people you're trying to sell it to you're not going to get your Capital back this notion that if you sell something you get the invested Capital back is delusional because you know beer bad business everybody knows it's a bad business they will often not just pay a low price they might actually pay a really low price Ford in 2009 thought they lose a business with Jaguar Land Rover so you know what they did they gave it away for almost nothing to data Motors they just want to get it off the books and then they heaved a sigh of relief 15 years later Jaguar Land Rover is the engine that drives starter Motors it's what drives the value of the company often selling your worst businesses is in fact the worst investment decision you can make from a pure Net Present Value standpoint because people won't pay it you know what your best candidates for people paying more than your value would be good go ahead I'm sorry no question eight eight absolutely right I mean in a sense I think often the imperative try to get rid of things is such that especially when a new CEO comes in they want to clear the table they would sell the the bad businesses because this way on a cosmetic level it looks like they're running a better company nobody seems to top and ask a question what's the price I'm getting for this business so which of the business do you think people would pay too much for because remember that's how you make money the price has to be higher than the value right let's say your star business is your AI business starting well above the cost of capital right it's also the business most likely to be the business where people will overpay for diversity is just like Acquisitions it all depends on the price getting rid of bad businesses does not make you a better company in terms of creating value because you're not going to get your money back it's too late you got to ask what's the price I get and if the price is too low you might be better off keeping the bad business and earning what you can on it so making money it's not losing money it's making it's just not making enough money you regret the original investment you made but you can't make up for it final question and this is kind of I think I mean I wrote this a decade ago when Google was a star let's see if your ads will be different now say Google is 60 billion dollars in cash right and it decides it decides return 45 billion of that cash in BuyBacks okay will you as a shareholder in Google be better off or worse off after the buyback and what will it depend on it versus it depends on whether you trust Google right they're not going to let you look at the projects you're saying do I trust schools ten years ago the answer would be absolutely today kind of shaky right because every project that Google has taken after that search box I mean the rest of the alphabet is like the Seven Dwarfs right they look at them it's like 94 of my revenues come from the search box 0.1 percent comes from this and point seven they're all money losing you know Google does have a great track record after the search box nothing they've done after the search box is paid off and of course you have this added bird enough were you asleep at the switch when AI took off I mean I don't know what the inside stories maybe were overreacting what I'm saying is 10 years ago Google might have been trusted and you say it doesn't matter whether you return it or today my guess is a buyback would get a very positive response and I wouldn't be surprised even the next few months you actually did see a buyback that would be the sensible thing to do because Microsoft did exactly the same thing in 2004 it is when people started to stress they actually did a buyback saying look you don't trust us here's your cashback which is the sensible thing for companies to do so as you watch the fangam stocks don't be surprised especially among the ones that lag that you start to see BuyBacks as a way of saying you don't trust us with the cash here's the cash back so lots of things in the agenda let's go go back to the last few pieces of Acquisitions remember I was trying to convince you to get to pay more than 60 million which is the value of the target company I try to get you to use your cost of equity and you refused then I tried to say look you have cheap debt no couldn't that bring that and you said no then I tried to get you to pay a 20 control premium he said not so fast then they said what about Synergy and you said show me the numbers I'm getting a little desperate here so I'm going to try a couple more plots I said look you know let's stop talking about intrinsic value it's a distraction put in a market who knows what the intrinsic value is we'll tell you what people typically pay for companies in the sector so I do a pricing I pull up companies in this case I pull up not every company in the sector but what I call transaction basically only companies that have done Acquisitions so I wanted to file that away so there are 25 companies but I picked the seven Acquisitions in the sector and they say they're paying five times added in those companies your habit is 20 million if you remember the target company five times twenty is 100 million Let's ignore the DCF this is what people have to pay to do an acquisition the pricing argument right um Professor uh we cannot see the screen oh thank you for letting me know right how about now yeah we can okay good so five times average pricing argument I said it's okay to make a pricing argument but I think there's a problem even on a pricing basis with this argument I want you to think about it what goes in this argument my my comparables and my multiple right it's always an issue in pricing but the way I've constructed my comparables and the way I pick a multiple I'm going to argue a much more problematic when you do acquisition pricing than in traditional pricing so let that file away if that doesn't convince you I will use a word that Bankers like to use to convince people to do deals I said creative the deal is a creative what does that mean when I say a deal is accretive my earnings per share goes up after this deal is done that's all I create a mix diluted means my earnings per share comes up it's an absolutely stupid reason to justify an acquisition but it seems to be magical there are companies that seem to believe it creative deals are good dilutive deals are bad we'll talk about what kinds of deals that are creative it's a purely mathematical effect and why it's not a meaningful measure of success so when you think about pricing let's start with the pricing question and statistics which sample all the time right when you do the peer group for your for your company you sampled you made choices about what geography is what Market gaps and sampling you have to do it otherwise a universe is too big is this a sample yeah the sample but it's a sample of transaction multiples is there a bias there what do we say about acquisition you pay 20 premium I've selected companies that did Acquisitions this is not even a pricing it's a pricing based on a subset that is going to deliver it's like I'll give you an example of a buyer Sample When is the coronation I know you got it on your calendar I'm sure you want to watch the damn thing you know there is a coronation right this guy came Charles is going to become king of England and it's going to be on TV let's suppose your sample is people who watch the entire coronation on TV and then you ask them what do you think about the royalty what do you think the answer is going to be we love the royalty 97 percent why because the only people who watch the coronation all the way through are people who are 75 years old who love the royalty it's a sampling bias if you pick a sample of transaction multiples you are creating bias you're going to push up your numbers for all the wrong reasons and this notion that you can push it off and say I'll do it in year five is that still a problem yes it's a problem the five is the problem not whether you do it now or not because the five came from a buyer sample so if you're going to do acquisition pricing get rid of the bias and the easiest way to get rid of the bias is we are pricing a software company rather than look at only other software companies that got acquired look at all software companies do a full pricing because if you want to pay a premium then you got to say why am I paying the premium rather than this partial pricing of focusing on a subset of companies so is everybody clear on the bias coming in when you use transaction multiples and why you need to expand the sample to look at companies that were not in transactions because otherwise you create bias in the process it's a I mean but that's really not an acquisition right you price buildings based on access it's a forward pricing right it's always been a pricing game it's never been about value which also means that when you when it's all pricing all the time what are you going to see in the market you're going to see booms and you're going to see bus because it's all driven by mood and momentum so real estate reaps what it sells right you create a pricing game where nobody's asking questions about intrinsic value it's the rental income enough to sustain the price sooner or later you're going to overreach so don't be a lemming just because everybody else is doing it no it's because the price that other people pay is five times a bit is not a good reason for you to do it the word of creative is kind of meaningless and here's why let's think in terms of PE ratios right you're a company with a PE ratio of 10. what kind of company would you have to buy in terms of P ratios for your acquisition to be a creative companies with lower PE ratios than yours are higher P ratios lower lower P ratios because if you're a company that buys higher p e ratios you're essentially going to lower your earnings per share because you're paying 20 times earnings for the other company so if you tell me that a creative deals are good you know what the followed through on that is right anytime I buy a company the p e ratio less than mine it's a good deal and anytime I buy a company the PE Ratio higher than mine that's a bad deal that makes no sense to me because if you're a company that's trading at 40 times earnings then you're going to buy everybody in the market say I got a good deal I got a great deal okay I think we should remove the word a creative and diluter from M A in general because I think more damage gets done because people focus on those words and in fact there's a McKinsey study that actually took deals broke them down into creative and deluda and actually looked at the follow through to see our accretive deals really value creating they actually found the opposite dilutive deals actually created more value than a creative days I wouldn't take that to the you know so I'm going to do only dilute don't go to The Other Extreme but it shows you that how it creative tells you very little about the deal you know the logic though that allows the creative deals to look good right the logic is I traded ready times earnings my earnings right now two dollars per share I'm going to do this a creative deal and what does it do it's going to make my earnings go from two dollars to 2.50 and finish the logic I traded 20 times earnings 20 times 250 is 50. my price is going to go up 20 where's the flaw in that logic because you bought a company with lower P right either because of the lower growth or higher risk now you create a combined company with that company part of you you still think you're going to get 20 times earnings after you do this I don't think so but as long as you keep this fixed PE and you apply it on earnings per share the creative deals are always going to look good and dilutive deals are always going to look bad now so I'm now at my wit set I've tried everything I can so I hit you with my trump card I said no and you're being very very difficult as a negotiator so I have to tell you just between you and me your CEO really wants this deal to go through so you might come in and say intrinsic value of 60 million but you see and what I'm trying to say is sometimes as a negotiator you're completely undercut by the fact that somebody above you wants this deal to go through and if that is the case you're done there's nothing you can do to stop the deal the other argument you'll often hear is everybody else in my sector is doing deals if I don't it's called it defensive acquisition you're doing it because if you don't do it you fall behind everybody else everybody else is overpaying everybody's consolidating if I don't do that then I'm going to be in trouble I don't have an easy answer to either one I mean we know that premiums paid and Acquisitions are affected by CEOs you know of all the things in behavioral finance that we've isolated that are dangerous in investing in corporate events the most dangerous is overconfidence of all the things that get investors and companies in trouble it's over confidence and we in a sense pick CEOs are likely to be overconfident people right I tell you know when you think about the kinds of people who become CEOs they're the kinds of kids you hated in high school you actually know very little but act like they oh no 10 times more than they do there's a lot of Bluster they rise through the ranks and they become CEOs of companies what's the essence of overconfidence you look at a company say I can fix that company you pay a premium I can deliver the synergy it's actually a study that was done I think 20 years ago that correlated premiums paid on Acquisitions to a bunch of variables and one of the things they correlated with is against the ego the size of the ego the CEO of the company so how the heck did they measure the size of the ego they actually measured look they counted the number of press mentions of a CEO's name and hypothesized that the more often you're mentioned in the press the bigger your ego it actually worked really well and it doesn't surprise me overconfident CEOs often carry this acquisition Gene no matter where they go so if you have an overconfident CEO you're in a sense almost predestined to overpay for acquisitions as for defensive Acquisitions I've never understood the logic you're saying you're going to overpay because everybody else over pays you think the only way you can survive in this business is by doing bad acquisitions you know what my response is why do you stay in this business why not just liquidate yourself and go away we talked about decline when you have businesses with the only way you survive is by overpaying and doing bad Acquisitions and you consolidate maybe the better option is to not stay in the business say you guys play the game we're going to liquidate ourselves and leave this business because otherwise you're going to end up throwing good money after that final pieces piece about accountability of you know HP can be almost to post a child for a company that overpays the company that every five years would the corporate governance problem then they have an overpayment problem and then they take a right off of eight and a half to ten billion dollars yeah and this was actually I'm going to highlight one particular acquisition this was like from almost 15 years ago so HP has been trying to reinvent itself now for almost 20 years right because it's core computer business is dead it's gone the printer business was their only Cash Cow but they weren't happy being a printer business it was not I mean they were HP this is a company that invented Venture Capital the guy I know on his sense at the at the birth of Silicon Valley so they've been constantly trying to reinvent themselves so in 2007 or eight somewhere around there they bought this British company called autonomy it's like a accounting software Services Company and they paid 11.1 billion dollars for the company it's a company that was trading at about 5.9 billion before so they paid a premium of 5.2 billion so essentially I try to build up to that number and essentially this is a very mechanical way of building up to it the book value preview Book value by Equity of autonomy was about 2.1 billion they bought an accountants who adjusted the value remember they you know write up the values of assets got to 4.1 billion in the Market at 5.9 billion and then HP pays an extra 5.2 value why Synergy control all the magical words and at the time they did this everybody else this is one of the few Acquisitions where everybody said that is way too much so the CEO of HP at that time a guy called leopard was actually in New York talking to I could a research analyst and they must have asked him you know why do you do the acquisition I'm going to read his words using his own words because I can't keep a straight face while I read these words I'd look in the other direction he said this is addressing the conference he's talking about the acquisition he said we have a pretty rigorous process inside HP that we follow for all acquisitions which is a d dot C dot f based model we leave it at that right we know there are good DCFS and bad DCFS yes no the very fact that he did A D dot C dot f based model tells you he knows nothing about PCF right and he referring of course this is journalist talking referring to discounted cash flow evaluation is standard it's not a methodology it's a way of thinking about value right it's what drives it and we try to take a very conservative View I'm very impressive with a conservative view coming up with a 5.2 billion and then he should have stopped because he kept going just to make sure everyone understands autonomy will be on day one a creative to HP that settles the whole thing right it's in a creative deal just take it from us we did the analysis at Great length in great detail we've got paid a very fair price for autonomy when you get a three greats in one a lot of greatness going on here one year later this happened in record time the deal unraveled HP blamed it on accounting problems at economy they said that's the only reason the deal came apart so when the deal came apart I decided I wanted to assign play because they actually wrote down the 11.1 bill into 2.3 billion that's an 8.8 billion dollar write-off somebody should lose their jobs for this right someone said let's see who should be held responsible so I broke it out I said there's 4.45 billion this is hp's fault the CEO promised all these fixes he didn't make it he should not only lose his job we should claw back his bonus and if we can go after his house go up to the houses cars investment funds whatever it is the secondary culprits there are of course the deal makers who put out the projections I would like to see that deal fees returned and make sure that they never do this again it is true accounting and propriety cost about 1.7 billion and the culprit for that is Deloitte maybe we can get the 1.7 billion back from them and at the remaining write-off this has to be HP actually running the company worse than it was run before so lots of blame around here right you know how many people actually have got held responsible for this do you think Delight returned the accounting phase no you think the banker said this is a bad deal sorry about doing this we shouldn't have done the projections now leopardica was retired as a CEO but he kept his bonuses no this is what I mean about lack accountability how do you make an 8.8 billion dollar mistake I don't know how that happened maybe the janitor did it He Slipped Away in the middle of the night bought the company for 11.1 billion when we weren't watching so let's no it's a pretty negative view I've given you of acquisition so I'm going to give you a glimmer of hope so let's say you end up at a company that are either an acquisitive company or you end up working in Acquisitions and you say look you know I want to at least create some value here so I'm going to give you some choices about where you can create value from Acquisitions and some of the choices are pretty easy so you can tell me which one you would pick so your objective is to create value for my Acquisitions would you prefer to be a soul better or be in a bidding war it's an easy one it's a little better would you like a public Target or a private Target and the reason being public targets start market Price Plus private you could you negotiate the value so you get know what's what's in there who do you prefer to pay with cash or pay with stock that's a tricky one depends depends on where the head well if you think you're overpriced as the acquirer you might want to use it it's gaming though right because the minute you tell me you're going to pay with shares I'm the target company and I realize you're paying good shares you've sent a signal to me about what do you think with your shares so guess what I do to the premium when you offer so it's this is going to deter be determined not just by am I overpriced but what's going to happen to the premium so we look at the net evidence and it's kind of mixed depending on big deals versus small deals would you prefer to go for a small Target or a big Target merges of equals emerges of unequals much better chance with a small Target right because if you make a mistake then it's not going to kill you at least you have a chance of fixing it and finally would you prefer to go for cost synergies or growth synergies cause synergies right let's save it back if we back this up let's start with so bit of us as bidding war and there's an awfully awful looking graph it came I directly took it out of the paper shows you how primitive graphs are still in academic papers okay this is a graph of what happens to two players were in a bidding war I'll tell you up front one is a winner and the other is a loser what happens to the stock price so time period zero is when the war is won by one side or the other so one of these is the winner stock price and one of these is the loser stock price which one do you think is the winner stock price it's a winner stock price there's a loser so if you're in a bidding war and I'm a shareholder in the company I'm getting none every night and say please God let them lose no this is basically the two bidders for the company and what happens is stock prices around the time a Target is actually pegged so being the winner in a bidding war is like you know but we know this from economics it's this there's this uh idea called the Winner's curse have you heard of this you go to an auction you really want something so you keep bidding Higher and Higher and you win the auction you should always have mixed feelings about winning notice that everybody around you is celebrating while you are for a different reason you're celebrating because you got that item you wanted everybody else is celebrating saying that guy paid too much the definition of winning often means outbetting everybody else so my advice is if you're getting a bidding world just drop out don't even fight this out at the end why expand the resources let somebody else play the game when you look at Cash versus shares it seems to depend on whether you're doing a small deal or a big deal so the way to read this is there's Cash There's stock combo and this is based on the size of the deal as less than six percent of the acquiring company six to ten percent so the larger the number the bigger the target is relative to you as a company on really small deals there's a blue part is really small deals you can see that using stock is much more value creating than using cash so if you're a big company buying really small companies now there you can use stock as currency and it seems to work better than cash as the deals get bigger though the gaming seems to work against you so when you have a hundred billion dollar company trying to buy a 50 billion dollar company and the 100 billion dollar company decides to use shares the gaming effect is the 50 billion dollar company pushes up the premium saying you're paying in shares that must mean you think you're overpriced so I'm going to charge it 15 higher premium yeah the massive acquisitions not necessarily right I mean because in a sense you could borrow money you can know and really big ones that might be that just the size effect itself is dominating but it that's that's possible so it might not be just the share effect the fact that almost every big deal creates a size of and focusing on private companies is a clear winner over public companies so basically the way to read this is again small to large deals in every single segment the green the the red is a private the blue is the public but there's an even better strategy than actually private targets it's divisions of public companies why because as I said CEOs do some really stupid things to clear the table the four Jaguar Land Rover story right that you play out you approach companies especially a moment of weakness you might be able to get a bargain yeah exactly right so I think in a sense you're seeing this play out so is it possible to create and finally cause synergies versus growth synergies is a McKinsey study that look the percentage of the time that synergies get delivered so to your right you see cost synergies are at the I think 92 cases 36 plus 61 of the cases you delivered a hundred percent or more of the synergies in contrast we look at Goat synergies about a third of the time you deliver the growth synergies a lot more failures on growth synergies so is it possible to create a strategy that creates value if you stay disciplined and you know how difficult it is to say discipline is an acquiring company you can start small you're initially disciplined but you get bigger and bigger it's almost you can see the seeds for the thing blowing up because you need to know when to stop but you can't stop this is the only way you know how to grow this is the Cisco story right a company that was a I mean Harvard Business School used it as case study this is the way you're supposed to grow with Acquisitions and it's usually at death now for a company when it you get used as a case study in orbit because that greatness which drove them from 19 to 99 essentially almost destroyed them John chamber same CEO same management you could see how the strategy turned on it said as the company going from 4 billion to 400 billion acquisition-based strategies don't scale up well and you can see why right as you get bigger you got to do bigger acquisition so more Acquisitions just to get the same growth rate so if you're going to do acquisition-based strategies I would say do it but every year you've got to say is it time to stop are we hitting the end of our tether in terms of what we can do with this so for acquisition to work discipline is the key word and discipline is often lacking so if you can find a disciplined company that can do Acquisitions and stop at the right time it's a value creator many of you are valuing companies or some of your value companies that have grown primarily through Acquisitions have a history of success what I'm saying is when you project out these numbers for the next five years the next 10 years and Beyond you might want to bring that success level down because history suggests that as they get bigger this is going to get more difficult to scale up it's easier to scale up organic growth than it is to scale up acquisition-driven growth and just because the magnitude of the companies any questions and Acquisitions and if you really want this process to work make sure you plan for Acquisitions before you do them hold somebody accountable for delivering on those numbers the banker doesn't care right he's going to give the projections or she's going to give the projections get the deal done and they're out of the door as fast as they can get but you're stuck with this company this is your shareholders money you cannot tell me Goldman Sachs is responsible for your screw-up because ultimately you made that final Choice yes go ahead yep well because you didn't have to pay so in a sense it would have been a loser you're bidding for a company stock price is 50 you bid 75 I bet 80 you've been 85 I bet 90. what's the definition of losing you stop bidding it's like being on eBay I will right but I now have to pay 90 dollars per share what did you have to pay no you walk away the rest of the deal so you don't have to buy the remaining shares right so when you think about bidding wars losing basically means you stop paying that outrageous price because you're no longer part of the bidding war but I have to buy the remaining shares at the price that I want it and if I'm paying too much guess how it's going to show up it's going to show up as a much lower stock price because i'm overpaid because you don't have to pay any more money right so let's say you bought up for 10 of the shares if you won what did you have to do buy the remaining 90 at that high price because you lost you actually will now make money do you know why because you're going to sell to the winner at the 90 you actually get an escape hatch that's amazing and eBay if they allowed me that'd be great to have an escape Hatcher and say you know okay betting you could pay me the high price it doesn't work that way but that's what you get in a betting War right yep that's just my yeah this is the market cap the market cap being greater than it's a good value growth right so basically the accountants can write up the value of existing assets so even if they do it right they're not going to get to the market value the extent that the market and assessment of expected growth that extra 1.3 billion was what the market was attaching over and above the accountant's estimate of fair value so think of accountants writing up all your existing assets to fair value the Market's paying a premium on it the more mature you get as a company the smaller that premium would be here there was some growth the market was paying a premium for that growth I'm not even passing judgment whether that number is too high or too low because I have 11.2 billion that's beating the market by 5.3 billion yeah that's not impact they should not it doesn't incorporate growth right because you can totally fair value and that's why fair value accounting can never be a direct competitive market Gap maybe for companies which have zero growth and the craft times maybe I can get them to converge and that's why I don't even know what the point of fair value accounting is to be quite honest what are we trying to accomplish by spending all these Resources by marking it up to Market when eighty percent of you I mean let's say I allowed you to do this for Zoom or snowflake right your fair value is going to give me no indication of what the company is actually what so let's talk about value and answer a totally value announcement and price enhancement are not necessarily the same thing I'm going to show you the results of two studies from a long time ago separated by about five years to illustrate this point the first study was done in the late 90s title of the paper I think was a rose by any other name and what they did was they picked a group of companies I think 60 plus companies that changed their names in a very specific way to peak of the.com Boom what do they do they added.com to their names and they changed nothing about their businesses because companies that changed the names and change business is different but your same companies decided.com and it was it was a extraordinarily common in the late 90s a company's Steel company would have.com names what's it.com doing resist.com but you could see why they did it because when this study looked at what happened to stock prices when you put.com in there the stock prices these are small companies they jumped a hundred percent a hundred and fifty percent because you now called yourself usteel.com you don't even know what that means particularly.com you think that's absurd but it also means that this entire class might have been a waste of time right we should have been talking about better names for companies maybe AI in your name would make a big difference Darden Restaurants AI I don't even know what that means but you know that looks good I'll add another 20 value the problem is if you play this game what the market gives the market will take away so the second study is just a few years later but now the.com boom is buzzed and this study also looks at companies that change their names you know what they did they took.com out of their names because by now.com was a contaminant people didn't want to be you know.com stocks they'd seen the failure rate and there you go stock price goes up again this is an incredible game you put a name in you take a name out you put a name in you take a name out but you can see that this is what pricing price enhancement is about you're playing games looking at what does the market like and I'm going to add that to my company and you could succeed you could push up your stock price 30 50 pick a name very close to Tesla you know how many times people mistype symbols and buy the wrong company make a tlsa who knows how many millions of shares you will sell before people ask oh my God this is not Tesla I've been buying for the last five years in my portfolio so when you think about value enhancement versus price enhancement you can see price announcement requires that you play the price again I don't know how to play that game keeps aging fat shade so I'm going to focus on value names and value enhancement is surprisingly simple to enhance the value of a company I need to change something fundamentally right there are only four things I could change I can change the cash flows from existing assets so that's my first stop can I extract higher cash flows from existing assets second stop I'm going to look at growth can I increase my value by changing my policy on growth and it can be in one of two ways either I'm reinvesting too little and I'm a good company I have great projects I'm leaving behind but reinvesting more will increase value or I'm a company that's reinvesting too much you know what I mean by that right you're taking projects that earn less than your cost of capital in which case what will increase values actually reinvesting less and taking the cash out of the business so that's the second stop third stop maybe I can lengthen my growth period remember during the growth period I'm earning above the cost to Capital right maybe I can find ways to extend that period from five years to ten it's another way of saying maybe I can build new competitive advantages barriers to entering and the final of course is maybe I can lower my cost to Capital what's the standard thing that comes to mind when you think about lowering cost of capital change the mix of debt and Equity but I'm going to argue it's one of four things you might consider to lower your cost to cap so let's start with the first to those trying to get more cash flows from existing assets so I'm going to start with words you often see in many restructures there's gonna be a lot of cost cutting around here and more efficient operations assuming you mean what you say the reason I say that a lot of companies can talk the talk but they never carry through what I hear is you're going to have higher margins right that's what cost cutting if you have assets that are losing money that you expect to lose money forever shut it down you don't even have depress them just don't keep them going you're saying why wouldn't somebody have done that already why do we have Aaron Hicks on the Yankee payroll still because the guy who signed them still right you know is the Yankee manager sunk cost right once you make the people who make mistakes will this is the reason people don't sell losers on their portfolio known as consistent evidence that people actually start to go blind on losers they only see the stock anymore they can look through her I don't see it I don't see it because as long as you don't sell it you're not admitting to a mistake right sometimes shutting a business down is an admission we should never have been in that business but the best you know shutting that business down will almost immediately create a pop for you because you're taking that loss out of the back the third is going to sound mildly unpatriotic but I'm going to say it anyway I have never viewed it as the objective for any company to maximize taxes paid to the government maybe you think differently now let me fully cover myself within the framework of the law I want to minimize the taxes I pay so what can you do well if you think about you know if you you know before 20 2017 when the U.S tax law change you did see U.S companies tried to move themselves out of the US because the global income no longer got taxed at a U.S tax rate and we talked about Pfizer alligator that was the mode of there but you don't even have to do any any contortions if you're a multi if you're a company in multiple countries right because with you know what transfer pricing is an entire ecosystem of people who do what's called transfer pricing which is really how do we minimize our taxes by moving things around they'd like to frame themselves as doing more glorious things but that's really what you're doing and how does it work you have a German subsidiary and now Irish subsidiary they have interactions with each other so in the German subsidiary buys stuff from the Irish subsidiary you make them pay high prices because you find an economic justification what does that do it takes income from the German subsidiary transfers into your Irish subsidiary and essentially allows you to pay less taxes overall you think this is so unethical well Walking On The Edge yeah but basically if you don't think companies do this on every cons I mean every company has tax laws people moving stuff I'm not a great fan of risk management I think frankly companies manage risk too much one of the advantages of risk management though might be smoothing out income so you don't get those spikes in income that cause your taxes to go up so you can try to increase habit you can try to reduce T you can see already it's a very mechanical thing I'm going item by item so what can I do now some capex is for growth right so just let's sensor but some capex is for maintenance keeping existing assets going if you can spend less Sun maintenance capex without affecting the capacity production well and that's a fine line if you cut too much you're going to see equipment start to break down it's an increase in cash flows and to the extent that you have lots of over capacity that you're invested in live off the fat for a while essentially don't there's no law that says you need capex every year right so if you've had overcapacity you know you have four years without capex you can still get cash flows from existing assets but the depreciation would keep it's a gift that keeps on giving so your first stop is can I increase cash flows from existing assets now when we think about restructuring companies you can be restructuring companies across the life cycle right where in the life cycle would companies have to be for this to be the primary place for Value enhancement what kinds of companies stable mature perhaps even approaching decline this is where you're going to go right this is where the bulk of your value comes from cost cutting let's talk about the second stop because now we're going to go beyond that mature phase are there some growth companies that are badly managed absolutely there's some growth companies that reinvest too little why because they have outlandishly high hurdle rates in any sensible economic world of your Market company a herded rate should reflect what invests in the market demand on investment no your heart rate should never be 30 or 40 if you're a U.S company but you know why some companies have hurt the rates of 30 or 40 because that's what they used to earn on their projects 5 10 15 years ago what does that mean they reinvest too little they're turning away projects that make 25 because that's too low yes we'll see this bike there's margins for safety margins for bias right we know that people are over so the reason to add those on those the margin for bias I'm okay with because what you're saying is what the irr I see on a capital budgeting project is a lie but people say it's 14 it's really like nine percent so I'm going to add five it's a very dangerous game right because once you add the five percent guess what the irr person does he finds new ways to create buyers to make 14 go to 19 I don't think it's healthy to play that game but you're right people said hurdle rates are too high a number but the consequence might be you might be rejecting good projects to them your advice is reinvest more take the 25 return project even though it's lower than the 30 used to make it's higher than your cost of capital so in some companies your advices reinvest more and that reinvestment can either be an internal projects or an Acquisitions as long as you meet the criteria of return and capital exceeding the cost of capital but the more interesting case is when you get to the latest stages of the life cycle of a company and there are really no good projects out there you can't earn your cost of capital the company keeps investing they're your advice on growth will be invest less but some of your companies try this out make your sales to capital rate I mean they make you grow trading Revenue zero percent and see what it does to value your first reaction is value is going to go down you might be surprised in this morning I had at least two people come into my office with companies but the higher they make the growth rate the lower the value begin say what's going on here what is going on with the sales to Capital rations of 0.5 the margins were small they were basically investing in projects earning well below the cost of capital and the model was telling them just stop your value will be higher doesn't mean the company will but for those companies you can see value enhancement often means be less ambitious it's a tough self right CEOs want to hear stories how do I get bigger how do I grow and you're telling them no you need to shrink and here there's some evidence if you're thinking about different ways of growing and you're saying where is my value added the greatest there's some evidence that's accumulated some of the most interesting work on valuation you know looking at actual empirical work comes from McKinsey because they have this proprietary database of all the clients they've tracked for 30 40 50 years so it shows up in the journal that McKinsey publishes called the McKinsey quarterly which you can actually get a free subscription to get on their site sign up and you can get the article so this is actually from a McKinsey quarter or a quarterly article where they looked at dollar value created by a dollar invested in different growth strategies and they've ranked them from best to worst so looking across a sample it's I don't know I don't know what's in the sample there was a proprietary sample but here's what they saw a dollar invested in new product development across all their companies created by the dollar 175 to two dollars in value value added so in terms of value creation coming up with the new product by far has been the most lucrative strategy does that mean every company should go after new products it's also the strategy the winners get these huge amounts and there are lots of potential losers the second best strategy is expanding an existing Market by finding a new use for a product or coming up with a way of getting customers to add on Uber's most value-added proposition is to take their existing Riders and find them to do something extra on the Uber platform because that's pure profit a dollar a dollar investor creates about 30 to 75 cents an additional bank so you want that number to be greater than zero right because you're creating that and then you get to the trick here ways of growth maintaining a growing share in a growing Market is still creating value because the market itself is growing right you get a buffer when the market is growing Indian and Chinese companies have a significant advantage over European companies for a simple reason the core Market is growing you can afford to be sloppy and get away with it because the market itself is growing and then you get to the bottom of the barrel strategies one is competing for sharing a stable Market it's never been a great way to grow you know why right how do you get a higher market share in a stable Market you cut prices you've got prices your margins go down you get the higher market share but what do you have to celebrate and you could you were surrounded by markets that are maturing Right restaurant business the smartphone business and you wonder how do you grow in a market like this and at the very bottom of the barrel you're not shouldn't be surprised is acquisitions by now you already had the lead and you can see why it's really difficult to create value from Acquisitions we we threaded the needle and talked about the ways you might be able to do it but it's really really difficult to do so and in general when people talk about growth I think the stable is a way of bringing them back towards saying you know what most of the time growth not only doesn't create value it destroys value so this is a percentage of companies that earn less than the cost of capital and more than the cost of capital 2022. it's one year I know it's all it's caveat it's added in 2022 70 or close to 70 percent of companies earn less than the cost of capital only 31 of companies earn more than the cost of capital some of them have good excuses right are the bad year some of them are young companies some of them are accounting but here's where those excuses run right out of that 70 40 percent have had trouble making their cost of capital for years a decade or more this is well beyond excuses very just in a bad business there are airline companies that have never earned their cost of capital in their lifetime ever I think it was Warren Buffett yesterday I was talking about the airline business if you get a chance to read a score it basically captures the fact that creating value in an airline has been almost impossible to do even the very best Airlines barely make their cost to Capital so you can go for cash flows you can drive for growth and with the growth Dimension you can see it's more your your range gets wider right there's some young growth companies you might advise to grow faster by reinvesting more and some older companies we might reinvest less much bigger circular companies third stop maybe I can increase the length of my growth period on the spreadsheet it's so easy to do right what do you do you take 10 and you make it 20. that was easy but in real life to earn more than your cost to Capital you have to have barriers to entry competitive advantages I'm trying to find a reason for your corporate strategy class this is where I have ended up is where in my numbers this is where it shows up right you build up competitive advantages shows up as a longer growth period I'm not a strategist but I can think of at least you know four conceivable competitive advantages the first is brand name we know it is an enduring competitive advantage in some companies but it's also a competitive Advantage we've seen companies waste away right it's not permanent it's not a given but to the extent that it lasts maybe if you have a brand name you can protect it and if you don't have a brand name you can try to find a brand name for doing something differently it's not for all companies right 80 percent of companies this is not even on the realm of what can you do a Walmart there is really no brand name component so let's talk about what else you could do maybe you can get the government to protect you from competition that's nice right but be careful what you wish for I mean remember the old phone companies were protected from competition amazing but why do you want to be a monopoly what's a great thing everybody hates you in your Monopoly right but how do you get back to them you charge them higher prices you hate me 40 more for you it makes you feel a lot better I'm hated I might as well take it out of them the only problem with being the phone companies you know Monopoly and when you get to charge 40 more you have to make a stop at the Regulatory Commission and they say three percent higher you get the worst of Both Worlds so if you're going to get legal protection against competition if it comes with restraints on pricing where you can't take advantage of it you might say thank you but no thank you switching costs you're switching courses you want to make the cost of switching into your product as low as possible and once people are with you you want to make the cost of switching out as high as possible you want to see it at play you know what what phone company do you use Verizon a t Verizon I wanted to go to the atnt office and ask can I switch to ATT they will make life so easy for you say well I'll do it right here and 15 minutes later you'll walk out with an ATT contract just don't try to read the contract which will run 15 pages in really small print you know what the small print will tell you right you're now atnt it's going to be really difficult for you to leave no but you would can you blame them because otherwise I'll be switching Verizon to ATT every month this is a commodity to me what difference does it make my service is bad either way okay but you can see in businesses like this I mean self-service is a business begging to be commoditized right so you're going to try to find ways to make yours your business stickier and this is one of those things yeah on here companies are scared yeah that's another mode to say Coca-Cola has around the business you could start which is what I think of as Castro cost advantages can come from lots of things one can be from economies of scale Walmart's advantage over other retailers for a long time is they did something on things on scale so much larger than every Home Depot wiped out local hardware stores because it can also be an in doubt cost Advantage right what's a ramco's big competitive advantage that somebody gave them 300 it's not like the CEO of aramco went and found this oil sometimes it's cost advantages you're endowed with because you happen to be in the right place at the right time you're a Peruvian copper Mining Company it's not like you did anything magical but you have a cost advantage and you can use that constant range in one of two ways right one is you can charge a lower price than everybody else and get a higher market share you can charge the same price as everybody else and end up which one's better you got to work through the numbers I can't tell you upfront because they're going to have different implications and finally let's talk about cost account it's true I can change my mix of debt and equity end up with a lower cost of capital but that's only one in four ways here's a second if you mismatched your debt to your assets you've created default risk you did not have to and you perhaps have a higher cost account you know what I mean by mismatch using short term net to fund long-term assets dollar debt to fund Euro assets it's a fixable problem nowadays with swaps and derivatives you you see the effects of mismatch right svb classic example of what happens when you mismatch two mismatching things stop there are two other ancillary things you can do that make your cost to Capital remember we talked about betas we talked about what drives betas how discretionary is your product or service if you can work at making your product or service less discretionary in effect you're lowering the weight of your company by lowering your beta you get a lower cost of capital the other thing we talked about was fixed costs your business with a lot of fixed costs you said your beta is going to be much higher if you can make your cost structure more flexible it's an indirect way of saying I have a lower cost of capital what I'm trying to say is that there are levers on cost to Capital which people don't even try they're so caught up in the mix of debt and Equity that they just stop there but the end result is you're trying to come up with the caustic Capital that's lower that can push up your value so I want you to play CEO for a moment I'm going to show you two companies from way back in time and you're going to be in charge of what you're going to fix in these companies to make them more valuable the first company is a German software company called sap it completes the Oracle it's a B2B company it sells software to other businesses to the valuation I did way back in time 2005. I'm not going to go through the details but I'm going to describe what the company was doing and I want you to think about what you might change in this company because that's what you care about what are the levers you can move to make it more valuable it's a company that reinvests about 57 of its after tax operating back in the business it's a pretty decent return on Capital 19.93 well above its cost of capital so it is clearly taking good projects it is reinvesting at least in 2005 so investing primarily in Europe and North America because also the markets are most comfortable in but their return capital is well above their cost of capital they're not a badly managed badly run firmative so the easy fixes are gone right because cutting is not going to work in fact it's probably going to have the opposite effect they are almost entirely funded with equity why because the people around the company including the founders who were still big shareholders did not like that primarily or almost entirely equidified it growing but growing primarily so you're the CEO what's the first thing what's the easy first fix you're going to make borrow a little more money don't go crazy no lbo so don't go to the other and say Let's do an lbo that will freak them out maybe use a slightly higher debt ratio right how much higher well what are the things we talk about corporate names is coming up with the optimal base of debt and Equity so in this case we work out the optimal debt ratio it works out to be about 30 percent debt so the cost of capital has minimized they have a solid rating still right now almost no debt what is that going to do it's going to make that caustic Capital lower everything else in the valuation is going to stay at it we'll be quite honest there's a wealth transfer happening when you do this right the value of sap goes up but where is that additional value coming from um it's actually coming from taxpayers right but the biggest advantage of debt is a tax advantage you take it so it is it's something that no lbo person ever wants to talk about directly they talk about value create no it's not value creation you're doing your value transferring you're doing it legally so I'm not saying you should go to jail but don't go around telling everybody how much of a value Creator you are great you got some tax advantages okay so I'm going to try to fix the debt ratio and I unfortunately when you don't know business that well that's what you got to stop because but I'm going to make at least a leap and say look maybe you can reinvest more I'm looking at the return on Capital they have relative cost to cap looks like they're stopping too soon right they're projects that make above the cost of capital and especially given the fact that their focus seems to be in North America and Europe my suggestion is perhaps you should be investing a little bit more in Asia that's the next growth market so here are the changes I make 70 reinvestment rate with much of that additional reinvestment happening in Asia and Latin America return on Capital I assumed which state it but that might be something to look at maybe the projects in those countries might have a slightly higher lower internet to work it out I did adjust the fact that no now that you've got more country risk I brought it into a higher risk premium saying you want to grow in those countries you have to hire but bringing everything together the value I get is about 126 Euros per share as opposed to what 106 Euros per share I know it's very you know it's very simplistic but in a sense that's what restructuring is right taking a dive into each number saying what can I fix that difference of 106 versus 126 what should I call that remember that card control card I held up and he put 20 in the back maybe it's not so bad it's actually around 20 percent here that difference is the true value of control things you can change it'll make the value go up to find right if I it's so much easier value and control when you have a badly managed company then when you have a company that for the most part like sap is well managed but has some blind spots yeah work out if those have business management what would be the office exactly and it could be much much larger than 20 right in fact I'll give you a favorite example this is now a company that's all that's left is on the internet you have the original Blockbuster store that's become this place that people visit as a I don't know why you would do that you must have an empty life anyways I want to visit the very first Blockbuster but I guess if you're a certain age this is Nostalgia that's driving you there I don't think you can actually rent tapes anymore there you just have to go visit take a picture and then leave okay but this was Blockbuster because Blockbuster was an incredibly successful company in the 1990s it was a roll up right because it was created by rolling up individual video stores done very well and then it had disrupted just as it disrupted in earlier business it got disrupted Itself by whom by Netflix very first Netflix version remember they used to mail out tapes and you'd mail them back and then it was quite clear and Walmart started offering that dollar rental where you walked in you could rent a table so they were being assaulted from both sides Netflix taking away some business the promise they didn't seem to notice they kept opening 20 30 new blockbuster stores every year it's almost like they were in autopilot so you know if you look at blog post this was um in 2002 or three their reinvestment rate was 26 that's a new stores they were earning a four percent return on Capital and the cost of capital is 6.17 and so this is growing the definition of insanities you keep doing the same thing over and over I mean the certifiably insane they're opening new stores nobody's coming in so they open even more new stores and say I don't know why bad things are happening to us if I made a CEO of Blockbuster and the day this happened it's a first and the debt ratio is you know 50 50. there's no Advantage at changing debt mixes and they're probably life slightly over levered what's the first edict you're going to pass when you come in as a CEO Stop opening stores that's the most value creating action you would take right it's not go and open more stores find the New Concept just stop I've always wondered with brick and mortar retail stores why that's not the first thing you do is stop trying so hard let's take a look at what we do to shrink as a business if all that Blockbuster did was earn the cost of capital which either means finding new stores or stopping opening stores the value that you get five dollars to twelve dollars and fifty cents it's an amazing increase in value 150 increase in value and wise that increase in value coming from because they're trying too hard they're trying to grow in a business it's value destructive foreign can add a significant amount of value that's the next step right so you take the easy step first and then you say is there a core business we can say the answer is no and the pathways let's go to zero if the answer is yes that you can find a group of maybe senior citizen homes where you put a blockbuster outside they have a video player still they're fighting the streaming thing they don't want this Netflix streaming through they want to put a tape in the machine it's a subset of people out there and say Blockbuster for really old people without streaming then what you do is you shut the business down and create that Niche business around it but in many cases there is no Niche business I don't think Bed Bath and Beyond even if you'd caught them before they went to the debt spiral there's probably no end game you could say they can save those 15 stories they see penny tried really hard right they said maybe this Core Business where people keep coming in so if there's a Core Business you will shrink down to that and make that your steady state but if there's no Core Business you shrink down to nothing you shut the business down but you do it in an orderly fashion which is you don't let the bond orders force you to liquidation because then you're selling at huge discounts you try to extract the best terms you can from remember many of your lessors want the sites back and you locked it in for the next 11 years maybe you can negotiate it going away say look we'll go away early you can rent out to somebody else at a higher fee but you can do it on your own terms if you can see the apocalypse coming you're making your reinvestment rate zero right so if I made the reinvestment rate zero I'd get a value of roughly 12 12 right there okay just removing that zero at zero all the way through because I have a three percent growth so not only am I destroying value for the next five years here I'm destroying value in perpetuity and I'm saying if I didn't do any of that that's an extra seven dollars and fifty cents that I'm losing in value that's how much value I'm destroying by trying to grow because basically you know at that point your existing Source you can't do much about right you're stuck with them but at least you've limited your damage to existing stores they will continue to earn less than the cost of capital and there you can say is there a way I can get to the cost to Capital by shutting my 50 most expensive stores I don't need Blockbusters in big cities I'm going to shut them all down the leases cost too much so you can start to try to strip down and see if there's a stopping point but requires time it requires that you not be pressured to have to do that yes for a lot of times some of them so you know some a subset of activist investors this is their Core Business right I'll be quite honest much of activist investing you know where the value comes from comes from the liability side of the biology that's why I think they lost their way that if activist investing is really about fixing operations I would be much more in favor of activists investing as it's played out I think seven in fact studies shows 75 percent of value created if you can call it that by activities investors comes from changing the debt mix and that's you know that's the reason I'm less less you know remember the overall economy does not benefit from that because that increase in value is coming from taxpayers the economy itself is not benefiting so you don't want investing that's focused on just the financial the financial side of the balance sheet you need operations but that requires work right do this you need to understand the business so the people who do this tend to be people who are sector focused because they understand the business you know Barry Diller for instance knows the business he's going into and when he says we can cut these costs he knows what he's talking about whereas if an investment banker takes over a restaurant so I know what cause to cut disaster ensues because he's cutting all the wrong costs so it does require work listen I did I mean I as long as the return capital is equal to the cost of capital remember growth doesn't matter so I could have made the growth trade zero and essentially left so you're talking about the next one or this one yeah this one I could have made the growth rate zero as long as the return capital is equal to the cost of capital the value effect is going to be roughly the same so in this case if you could show me you can open new stores and earn the cost of capital I will but if you can't find that I'll just say shut the reinvestment rate to zero and you'll get a value per share roughly equal to 12.50 the same effect we saw with the terminal values once the return Capital equates the cost of capital the value effect goes away okay it depends on what happens when you shut stores if you shut stores and you get nothing back it might not help that much but if you shut stores and you can actually get cash back because you shut the stores it could potentially make the value even better because you're shutting your worst stores first right you're shutting the stores with the lowest return on Capital first you're making the return capital what's left so you're at least trying to preserve a core of your existing assets so they earn their cost of capital it's more difficult though to back out bad investments from the past because it's the same reason divestitches about businesses don't work it's not like people are lined up around blockers I'll buy your video rental store from you because they know it's not working people are not coming in it it's basically just maintenance yeah let's talk about it last piece today is let's talk about the expected value control so value control comes from changing the Way businesses run right but to do it what do you have to do you have to change the way a business is run it's a probability that you can make that change that property can range from zero to a hundred percent if you have an activist investor who's powerful enough to say look I can pull this off it might but if if when you talk about corporate governance and this is where corporate governance comes into play what is corporate governance it tells you the likelihood that you can create change when change is needed if you're a weak corporate governance effectively are saying the likelihood of change in this company is low which means the expected value of control which is the product of the two numbers is low so if you have a badly managed badly run company you have a zero chance of changing the management you know what the expected value of control is zero you know the company could be worth a lot more but you can't change the management you're stuck with the existing management so you're saying how do I assess that property as an outside investor when you're investing in these companies especially if they're badly managed and badly right you're almost implicitly also making an assumption of maybe change will come here so here are some of the things that might affect why that property will change one is when Court in some countries corporate governance laws have created more change because they made it easier for people to child companies Europe 30 years ago you couldn't challenge existing management now the laws have changed enough that you can do it the presence of activists investors if nothing else you don't have to like a call I can you don't have to like a Bill Ackman but let's face it their presence in markets increases the likelihood of change why because you use it as a threat against management you guys keep doing this it's like the the demon in the in the closet that you used to scare little kids I know he's not supposed to stay in your bed and the Demon's going to get you this is the Carl icans in the closet and he's going to come out to get you if you don't stop doing it and finally anytime and this is interesting anytime there's a hostile acquisition in your sector it's almost like every Management in the com in in that sector wakes up say baby that could happen to me so when you look at studies that look at the likelihood of change of management it's actually interesting studies because they're based on this statistical approach called probe where you look at companies with management changes versus doesn't here are some of the common features you feel you see in companies where management changes companies are not no surprises companies with stock prices have gone down relative to the peer group are more likely to see change than stock prices have held their own or gone up change is more likely at companies after period of stock price declined okay second the structure of the board seems to matter to the extent that if a board is small and composed of Outsiders you're more likely to see chains and if a board is large and not that independent of the CEO third ownership structure seems to matter it seems that that CEO changes are more common in companies with high institutional and low Insider Holdings and finally change seems to be more likely in some Industries than others in some Industries it seems to be embedded in the process that you know management stays on I mean one of my problems with technology is what I call founder worship okay it's less now thank God than it was 10 years ago but think of it the peak of tech companies five six years ago how we viewed the Mark Zuckerberg you know the brands and the the Jeff Bezos of the world we viewed them as you know saviors essentially these people could do no wrong and that makes it much more difficult to create change but things change and now of course people are more receptive to it so when you think about expected value of control those are the places so on Monday I would do I would bring your results together and I'll do the last few pieces in the value enhancement because in particular I want to focus on the fact that every consulting firm especially the ones for what I call cream Consulting high price Consulting are doing the version of value Consulting the problem is that they showed you a discounted cash flow model they can't charge you the five million dollars a year and then the additional effects so they each have seemed to have created acronyms magical words if you do this your value will go up and I want to kind of expose those acronyms to what they are cfroi Eva I mean every consulting firm is their own acronym and essentially say ultimately values value you can't change the mechanics of value these acronyms are shortcuts and sometimes shortcuts create consequences so I'll take EB an approach that most people don't use just to show you what can happen when you get focused on a shortcut like Eva instead of looking at the overall value of the company so I will see you on Monday and you can put your numbers into the master list I will use that to put the final presentation together so what is to do is they're both push together the value can produce yeah you're changing companies and making dreams in this case I'm not sure what your question is foreign but as the deal gets larger so if you get soaked with gas deals small cash peers but if you start with the big deal it starts getting really bad because people when they're singing shares to pay for it so it's small deal to use stock with larger deals you use cash yeah because we look across the deals you you're more likely to get a much more sensible cream when you use cash because otherwise people sit before it's like including chairs 
together foreign foreign but you still have time so get the numbers in so you don't lose the Five Points um but everything you're going to see will reflect your numbers you know how those you have those disclaimers on emails that you get saying I'm not responsible for any of this stuff here so I've just taken your numbers so if you've screwed up and added an extra zero I just left the extra zero in because you know so I'm going to show you what you found in this class and maybe show you how it's different from previous semesters and maybe whether there's any information in it no over the weekend though I did write a couple of posts on banking I don't know I mean I know you've had other things on your mind and you're reading the post is not in there but you do get a chance and you're interested in banking a Friday I posted about you know what's a bank how does it make money I'm just let's say I'm not a banking expert so I went down to base you know how do banks make money what separates good from bad Banks and yesterday I asked the follow-up question which is what banks are good Investments different questions right what makes for a good bank is not necessarily what makes for a good investment a good bank at two higher prices a bad investment a bad bank at a really low price is a good investment and uh so if you get a chance sometime after you're done with the final exam if you want to come back and read those you're welcome to so let's get the process rolling we're going to do as I said this is going to be about what you what you've turned in and I'm going to use your presentation this kind of the lead-in to the class so if you think back to the start of the class I said there are three ways you can put a number on an asset you could do an intrinsic valuation where you estimate expected cash flows and it sounds so sophisticated when you say estimate but now that you've actually estimated numbers you know it's a mix of guesswork and hope and prayer that goes in Revenue growth I don't know what will be let me make up a number 27 that sounds reasonable pricing where you look at what other people pay for similar assets and you can already see that similar is more in the eye of the behold than anything else as you define what your comparables were and once in a while this option pricing approach and the nice thing about it allows you to add a premium on your DC advantage that's why people like option marks and I'll let you pick your own company so I really did not restrict you on what what you could do but if you go back to the core of what we're doing in entrance evaluation essentially we were trying to estimate the value as a function of questions you ask about a company it shows up as a model as an equation expected cash flow is divided by a discount rate but embedded in there are answers to questions like what what are your cash flows some existing assets that's where we always start right with the income statement statement of cash flow is a balance sheet you're trying to say what are the company's existing Investments and what are the cash flows from those Investments the second big question that kind of writes in this process is what is the value added destroyed or destroyed by growth because growth by itself is not a good thing growth can be a good thing pushing up revenues and earnings but it requires reinvestment it's a new cash flows how risky is this company shows up in your discount rate and when will your company become a mature company becomes a terminal value what I love what I'd like you to take out of this class is a recognition the next time you see an Excel spread you need DCF model step back and say what are the answers that the analysts is giving to these questions and do I agree with those answers and of course in my version the model which I kind of forced on you and I did it partly for my own purposes it made my life easier because I wasn't checking 100 spreadsheets from scratch they're three drivers of your cash flows your Revenue growth that capture the growth part of your business model a Target operating margin that effectively captures how profitable your business model is and it says to Capital ratio that captured how efficiently you delivered growth and my argument is no matter how complicated your business model is with the non-financial Service Company those three inputs should be able to give me my cash flows I don't need capex working capital all those line items are kind of distractions this is my endgame the risk in your operating cash flows gets captured in your cost of capital you don't like pay just throw them away I really don't care whether you use betas to get to a cost of equity but risk needs to come into your discount right and remember a discounted cash flow evaluation is an exercise in valuing a going concern what does that mean I mean do you look at it as kind of cash flow valuation you estimate cash flows a year next year two years from now three years from now five years from now and then you estimate cash flows forever that's a going good sir why is that a problem if there is a chance your company will not make it because it's distressed it could be nationalized terrorist attack could wipe it out then you got to bring it in explicitly through failure risk so ultimately your entire valuation the TCF spreadsheet those are the only five inputs everything else kind of revolves around those five interests now over the weekend quite a few of you emailed me and told me you didn't like your value and I said okay you know it's but it's coming from your growth your margins your sales to Capital and your cost of capitals if you don't like your value one of those things has to change so I mean it sounds heartless because I think you're expecting a you know some mate there is really no Insight right it's your drivers of value that affected so when you get too lower values because one of those inputs is essentially a number that you don't like so those are the driver's event and and early on we talked about hey you can make whatever assumptions you want about each of the inputs but your valuation has to be internally consistent consistency is what you can check for what does that mean you want to assume a high growth rate it's your company your story as long as you're not making your company bigger than the market I'll go along but I want to see that you're putting in enough money into capacity to deliver that growth that's basic it's basic math basic economics this is not some valuation nitpicking without the capacity you can't deliver if you talk about high growth and high margins the company improving it I'm going to push back and say that's a great story but where's all the competition here because if you're growing you're getting market share usually you have to cut prices so you must have some competitive advantages so essentially in every part of the story I'm looking for whether you've made trade-offs business is full of trade-offs and one of the things that I think snakes valuations off the tracks is when you pick one input and just move it up and down as if you're in complete control I talked about how when something lowers your cars your first instinct is I'm going to give the company a higher margins but what's the question you need to ask before you give them a higher margins are your cars and only your cars slower than everybody's cost lower this is why I don't buy the AI pitch which is if AI comes along everybody's going to get more profitable I'll make a prediction AI comes along we're all going to get less profitable because if it brings on a cost structure as you promised it will everybody's going to cut prices nobody's going to walk away with higher margins so think through trade-offs so I looked at your choices and remember I didn't restrict you in picking companies other people could have picked the same company yo I don't know what it is about this stupid Lululemon every single semester it's up there okay I don't know whether it's you like their clothes you hate their clothes you know they said Lululemon you think that this is the biggest most dominant company in the world and it's a Nvidia made it to the top list this year which it hasn't before so it tells you something about no and we'll talk about what it is that let's you know when you pick the company remember you didn't do it randomly right you picked it based on something my guess is you have a lot of momentum companies in your portfolio because they caught your attention right the companies are 50 I want to see what's going on and the bunch of companies with more than in fact I stopped it for like eight companies where two people did the company now one one question I've often been asked is why do you love more than one person to do a company I don't care it's not like you're going to get the same value for the company right you value the company you know it's not like this uh this is not an accounting class we pick three companies the balance she's going to look exactly the same at the time that you're done in fact take Lululemon that much sought after company three companies first the date you did your DCF varied no because I know for some of you there was this question first quarter reports are just starting to come out and I you know I got at least a couple of emails last week asking a first quarter report just came out do I need to update the numbers and I said you don't need to I'm not going to penalize you in terms of points but if you're going to put real money behind the Buy on May 8th you might want to update the numbers because you're you know it's not like you have the luxury of saying I'll buy as of March 31st I didn't know what that means I can't go back in time you buy as of right now let's see evaluation but then you can reflect this you can see the price per share is different depending on the day to the valuation the DCF values are different as well all three did come to the same conclusion which is the stock is overvalued you should sell it that's not always been the case I mean one semester I think that this was a particular group that I was particularly worried about because the biggest picks were I think Krispy Kreme Donuts Netflix I mean Netflix it was almost like they were sitting in their couches eating Donuts watching Netflix I haven't picked a company yet what should I do you could see it roll out like 11 people pick Netflix seven Krispy Kreme Donuts I remember the third one was Tinder is publicly traded that might have shown up on the list as well but it wasn't I would think it's almost like you could see people picking an arms it's what I use why don't I do it so it doesn't you know so the fact that you picked the same company doesn't make you mean you pick the same purpose look at the divert and the younger the company the more Divergent your stories will become so if 10 people pick Tesla which my undergraduate class 10 people pick Tesla very different end games because the stories they tell about Tesla can so the earlier in the life cycle you catch a company the more Divergent the values are going to be because you pick different story notes so here's what you found so what I did was I took a DCF value I compared it to your stock price so currency is not an issue right whatever currency you're in it's the same currency across the board now the greens are undervalued the Reds are overvalued 36 of your companies were undervalued 71 were overvalued this semester I see more of a tilted over value than probably any semester for about 10 years or so so far more overvalued companies the median company was overvalued by about 19 so from a DCF perspective you were finding a lot more over value than undervalued companies and here is the list of the most undervalued companies according to you and I I've left the capital letters because I remember the first when I first started texting my daughter made this big deal about Capital means you're screaming and so maybe this is screaming by and you wouldn't say look I like this guy or maybe you just hit the caps lock button on your on your keyboard and forgot all about it but I didn't want to play it edit you know put some editorial comment here so I left the Caps as caps and the non-caps as caps so so you these are you almost underwear and I'm defining undervalued as a percentage difference so basically the price relative to the DCF value so most undervalued company according to you is upwork and undervalued by about 75 you can go down the list okay um you're saying what happened in Aviana I think that the person doing it made the value and the pricing but they either couldn't make up their mind about buy or sell or they forgot there was a row out there but again I don't want to play editorial here I just left it as a blank because that too tells me something about where you are in the investment process right I'm here but I have no idea what to do so I leave it black so yeah so if you're Aviana Healthcare please go in and fill in your buy sell or home my guess is you just forgot this late at night you got the numbers that in there um of of the most undervalued nine were by PNC who is a the person who did PNC in here why did you hold because I can I I have a story but I think I I understand it but why don't you tell the class why in spite of finding it undervalued do you hold it can a valuable bag become worth nothing in a week what has to happen your deposits leave right with a bank that's always you worry it's sticky deposit so one of the things I wrote about in banking is what drives the value of a bank is how sticky your deposits are what determine stickiness of deposits sorry what is confidence event but that's you know but that's we're moving in circles right so we're denies what can Deliverance confidence is so I need something more tangible yes sir correlation one is to the degree that you have homogeneous depositors you have less sticky deposits and heterogeneous to put think of what made Silicon Valley Banks deposits so sensitive so it catered to Silicon Valley these people not just hang out together they're virally connected so one one leaves they take the entire crowd with them so you look at look at diversity of depart Regional banks are more likely to have deposit runs and National Banks because you know you're in a particular region people are Panic you know they see lines outside a bank and other people join in it's also going to be driven by corrupt growing banks will have less sticky deposits why because it's like you know you've seen cohort analysis that if somebody stays on a service for longer they're more likely I mean we do this with user-based companies all the time a subscriber-based companies that somebody's been with Uber for 10 years is more likely to continue with Uber than somebody just joined last year fast growing Banks you like the growth but they also come with less sticky deposits so I understand PNC Bank could look undervalued but he's saying can I pull the trigger because who knows what can happen yesterday I did pull the trigger on City where I bought city city trades at a half of Book value it has below average returns and Equity it's it's well below it's cost of equity I did an intrinsic valuation of pricing and I said a bike City with City I'm less concerned than I am with a Regional Bank it's a national bank it's a boring starchy badly run back but it's priced to be an even worse boring horrifically run bank and if you can buy a bank that's badly ran and it's priced and it's horrifically right you're getting a bar but with banks I can understand if you find a Regional Bank to buy a developer I can understand the reluctance of saying look I think it's undervalued but who knows you're one rumor away from the whole thing undraft carry most overvalued stocks somebody really hates the New York tax so the New York the person who did New York Times here what is the story that is driving the New York Times towards zero here it has to be a pretty depressing story about uh about the newspaper right I can think of I mean I'm going to take it today it's impossible there are plausible stories you can tell about how newspapers are heading to Oblivion so as a person who did New York Times willing to tell me the story for the New York Times driving the value 1.72. so I'll fill in your story here's the story that I mean ultimately the old way in which newspapers still which is through circulation advertising is breaking down right online advertising is covenanting in fact you see this almost with most traditional newspapers what's allowed the New York Times to stay above The Fray what's what have they done they've actually one of the few newspaper companies unique in fact contrast to New York Times The Washington Post to see what the New York Times has done they've actually created not just a digital version but they've created a digital version with stickiness if any of you is the New York Times cooking app it's a standalone app and as you go through and you collect things that app collects you so if the only way you can cook is the New York Times recipe you're not ever stopping a subscription to New York Times they've also they bought Wordle the gaming because they realize a lot of people buy the New York Times not to read the news but to do the crossword I know it sounds weird but now they've essentially I mean but you can see that one of the few newspapers that's done something but in you in the story that's being told here all of that comes to not because the digital version so it's a plausible story but the most overvalued and you can go down the list and essentially again the percentage of evaluation is captured by how much over that again budget cells with a lot of shouted cells as well foreshouted cells seven subtle cells but they're all cells as well now of course you know this has been going on for as long as I've been teaching the class so one of the things I go back in time every few years and do is I look at recommendations made in previous semesters and I tracked them this more from it's more as much a measure of the class as it is of you right because you know is it is this whole class random or the buy sells so you know the spring 95 97 99 I've got low enough time right I cannot do it with the 2020 class because the essence of intrinsic valuation is to wait I'll tell you what I find if you look across the years on average there is no it's it's it it's beyond so it might this might sound like a song you beat randomness Randomness would be 50 50 shots about 60 percent of buy recommendations go up and only 45 percent go down it's not a hundred and zero so it's not perfect obviously and we know that already there when you look at across companies the excess returns of my recommendations on small companies tends to be a much better track record than it you know recommendations or large cap companies the payoffs are very skewed in other words when you look at a portfolio buys and you look at why they outperform the market and they historically have it's because of one or two big winners and this is true for Equity investing in general this is a study by a guy called bessembinder I think he's at the University of Arizona what he did was he went back and looked at stock returns over the last 80 years and he looked at what your returns sort of looked like if you took the top 10 stocks out of every year you'd have made less than the table rate if you did the top 10 stocks out of every year now you can look at that and say that's why I pick stocks but you can also look and said that's why I don't pick stocks you see why it can justify both you can say that's why I pick stocks because I am good at finding those top 10 but you can see the downside of picking stocks when you pick stocks and those 10 never make it you could dramatically underperform the market give the example of the last decade right if your portfolio did not include the fangam stocks Facebook Amazon Netflix Google Apple and Microsoft I don't see how you could have beaten the market in the last decade it would have been impossible to beat the market why because they accounted for one in six you know amount of the market cap added for the last decade those six stocks accounted for you know 16 of the gain in market cap the 7 500 companies in the market you know the lesson I think you take out of this is those winners are what's driving the portfolio now for whatever reason uh I don't think this has ever happened before my name came up in the Bookshare Hathaway and I got like a thousand text messages it came up in a good way and a bad way some guy I got up and he asked a question about the fact that Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio is now 40 something percent in apple right so now because of and he would yes you know I don't know why he brought up my name in this context he said but this way somebody else can get insulted I guess he said the motor and says you shouldn't have this much and Charlie Munger no I don't think even uh knew who I was he said he said he basically said I was out of my mind I think is what the words of use but this is a debate what happened having about concentration and diversification if I know in fact the counter I'd have had if I'd been at the meeting and I don't plan to be there he said Charlie would you ever be okay with me taking 40 of my portfolio and buying a company I answered probably no no that's that's crazy but how did Apple get to be 40 plus of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio it did much better than the other stocks so the question is when a company rises in your portfolio because it's been a really big winner should you then be okay with it becoming 40 I don't think so but you can see that the arguments here are subtle because you can say that's my big winner and if I you know if I start pruning it then how will I make returns over the lottery now if you think about how a portfolio a company gets to be 40 it's because you've increased the value 10 seconds I mean I look at my portfolio my biggest single holding is Nike weird right it's an investment I made 17 years ago of ten thousand dollars it's kind of grown over time it's it's not quite got to a point where I have to prune it to be because it's not 15 my portfolio but sometimes when companies rise over time you are going to see them get bigger but for them to become a large person in the portfolio they've got to be outperforming everything else but it's a debate worth having about what to do with the winners in your portfolio finally stocks that were undervalued in both the DCF and a pricing basis did better than stocks that are both under just undervalued on one basis I know you know often people make you choose are you a believer in intrinsic valuation or do you do pricing my response is why should I pick my first instinct to do intrinsic valuation but that doesn't mean I should also do pricing yesterday when I valued Citigroup I started with an intrinsic valuation I came up with the value of 69 the Stock's at 43 and I said I want to buy they needed to price it why because then I get a double whammy right two things moving in my favor all I need is Traders to jump on and push the price to book up and I'm going to benefit yes what is the intuition behind it pricing in interesting values uh correlated at all it's not that they call it but remember for you to make money on your valuation what has to happen there's got to be a correction there's got to be a correction right so what you're saying is if a stock is both underpriced and undervalued they've increased the odds of that correction because when something is not depressed remember for evaluation saying nobody else is doing intrinsic valuation how will they ever know with pricing now you have a second force that might cause traders to adjust so could you say that uh something that is undervalued but priced uh properly will take a longer time exactly it's a catalyst moment because then people are going to feel okay it looks okay pray so why are you making such a big deal so I think that's what you're hoping for because you need that Catalyst to make money and value to be pricing can provide that Catalyst because I need Traders coming around to my point of view to make money on a snow now there was one final piece of the value of the the chain the the last session that I did not get to which is the value control and I talked about how the value of control comes from the fact that you can run a company better than the existing people can in a sense when I asked you to do evaluation I did I didn't ask you the value control but let's say I had added that as something to do on the process you know you'd have to do that right you have to take your valuation and say what if somebody else ran the company and it releases you to change some of the key inputs about how they fund the company how much they reinvest how will they go so it's almost like you'll have a revenue growth margin a sales recover ratio with a different person running the company delivering a different bag but of course to do all of this you got to be able to change the way the company's run and I said for that you're looking at the corporate governance company voting shares versus non-voting shares in a Facebook there's really no point doing or what if this changes what if that changes because Mark Zuckerberg is firmly in control so let's talk about when no about the issues that drive the expected value of control as I said corporate governance laws affected obviously as they change over time many Emerging Markets corporate governance laws have have moved in favor of shareholders it doesn't mean shareholders have a lot more power but they have a chance at least of doing it it could also come from the presence of activist investors there was a time when activist investors were restricted to the US now you see them in Japan you see to the point where activists invested in Japan were essentially not even allowed into manual meetings now you see them show in other parts of the world essentially they're rocking the board and finally as I said if you see one hostile acquisition in a sector it's amazing how quickly the entire sectors expected that so some of the things you look at to decide whether this chance of changing management you're going to look at stock price performance companies that have done worse relative to the market are more likely to see change than stocks that have done well you're going to also look at the structure of the board who own shares with institutional investors looks like there's a greater chance of control but all of these go to your assessment of is there a chance that the management of my company could change some of you are managing badly valuing badly managed companies and I think at the back of your head the question asking is this is a badly managed company they're taking projects that make less than the cost of capital like continuing to do it in a sense in perpetuity but what's going to cause it to change and if you decide to go that route then of course the value control comes in so I'm going to talk about four contexts where this expected value of control comes into play the most obvious one is when you think of a hostile acquisition what is the word hostile app is an undercurrent what do you say okay that you don't like the management of the company you don't like the way it's run you're going to change it right that's the subject as opposed to a friendly acquisition you're essentially saying I think control in this company is worth worth something because I can run the company better I'm going to argue that even when there's no acquisition when you buy shares in a publicly traded company you're paying an expected value for control let's say you take a company that's badly managed and badly right now right but you're in a market where there's a chance that things could change a car like at could come in and push for change it's got to be built into the price right and the greater the likelihood that an icann will show up the more the price you will pay in other words you're paying a premium over your status core value why because you think change would make the company more valuable it could be a company with voting and non-voting shares so I said this used to be par for the course in Latin America we had preferred shares and common shares but around the world there are still companies with two classes of shares we know intuitively which class should trade for a higher price the voting share should rate but the way people come up with that premium is almost arbitrary they look at studies say eight percent premium based on historical studies it's like the 20 control premium I'm going to argue the expected value of control can give you a way of estimating the premium on boarding shares and finally in private companies or private businesses let's say you're acquiring a stake in a private business and I give you two sticks one is a 51 stake in that business the others are 49 state just a two percent difference right you will pay far more often for the 51 percent share that the 49 share why it's called a minority discount basically that you're discounting the second stake because you get a minority ownership of the cup you don't get to say now how the business is right we'll talk about how to attach a value to that discount so let's start with a hostile acquisition I'm going to go back and use Blockbuster as my example because we had two values right if you remember one value was five dollars and I think you know five dollars and something cents the other was twelve dollars and 47 cents per share let's say you're required that you plan to acquire Blockbuster you're tired of waiting for the managers to do the right thing so if you think about the difference here it's um the stock was actually trading at nine dollars and fifty cents so we'll talk about why it wasn't trading at the lowest trading at 9.50 as an acquirer you might say look the value if I fix it is 1247 there's a 2.97 extra value would you pay that as your premium in an acquisition Lisa if you paid the 1247 what would essentially have you done that you're going to do right in a sense it's unfair so if you're going to Value control first step is how much of that value do I keep for myself this is not a number it's going to pay as a premium because otherwise all your hard work comes tonight if let's say it'll take you three years to make this change how would you modify the prayer first of all the premium go down or go up if you have to wait three years the more difficult it it's made for you to make those changes and the present value effect is really all that's happening right 2.97 being discounted so in hostile Acquisitions the value of control is always at play which means you if you're assessing a hospital acquisition you have no choice but to Value the company twice there is no way around that process you're saying but what if I'm not looking at the company as a hostile acquisition let's go back to Blockbuster let's take the Hostile acquisition off the table right remember I told you the stock price was 950. let's say you trust my two valuations I mean I've made assumptions my two valuations were five dollars and Thirteen Cents was the status quo value and 1247 was my optimal value could you estimate a probability that change will come to the company solve for it turns out the property of change coming to the company is 59.5 percent but this was after Carl icann showed up at the company before he showed up the stock price was only 8 20 and that attached so you're saying what happened very simply when an activist investor shows up at a badly managed company it's not that the status quo value the optimal value changing but the probability of change is increasing and as it moves further up you're going to see the stock price drift towards 12.47 now do you see why if you live in a market where corporate governance is dead market prices are going to be lower because every company doesn't go to straight at the status core value that radically UK actually Market it's not as long as change and thinking of removing lots of their governance protections that are now going to be allowed to have fuel cost shares I mean I'm not that supported in the accounts I guess what you're saying here is over time yeah because in a sense if I make it more difficult for change to come investors are basically going to go back to status quo value this used to be true in many Emerging Markets we I mean we're Reinventing history it's not just the UK look at the us we provide two classes of shares you're essentially moving in the wrong direction across the board we now risk pushing prices down towards status for value and making change impossible at these competitions yeah so when you look at the value of stock in a publicly traded company it's essentially a weighted average of the status core value so if markets are even markets are efficient and the optimal value with the weights based upon the likelihood of change coming so it's a very simple way of assessing how strong is Corporate governance and markets to look where between those two values you add that I'll wage if you look at the technology companies that have gone public over the last 12 years almost all the prices have to stay at the status quo value there is really almost no chance of Outsiders pushing for change in these companies whether it's Google or Facebook or any of the large companies that have essentially gone public I think the exceptions are companies like uber that decided not to have two classes shares and I've got to give Uber credit for not doing it but they were the exceptions rather than the rule a talk about voting and non-voting shares right so do you see how this would work remember I said that in Latin America for the longest time this was the rule not the exception the voting shares were called common shares and the non-voting shares were called preferred shares preferred chairs in Latin America are not like preferred chairs in the U.S preferred chairs in the U.S are more like bonds than shares they're like you know fixed cool so preferred chairs in Latin America just non-boarding shares and as I said we know voting chess should trade a premium we just don't know how to get there so I'm going to try here's what I did I valued no in this case embryo was a company I was looking at I value the broad plus I came up with the status quo value of 12 and a half billion Brazilian realized and then I revaluated with a few things that I thought they could change that came up with 14.7 billion you got two numbers floating around right and here's the game I played I'm making some implicit assumptions that I'm making split in a while I took the 12 and a half billion and I divided by the total number of shares voting a normal essentially what am I saying if I get a non-voting share I'm stuck with the status quo there's not much I can do so essentially your price per share value per share should be based on the 12 and half billion I came up with 17.38 cents you get a say in how the companies run let's say there's a 20 chance that you can actually change the management abroad remember a Brower has the Brazilian government as a shareholder with a golden chair which means that they can veto it so the property of change is low let's say this 20 chance you take 20 of that difference and you divide it just by the voting shares why because only the voting shares control that change so what you're doing is adding that to the 1738 the value per share that I get for the voting shares is 19.19 the voting shares traded a premium but think of what's driving the premium first is how well managed to badly manage the companies let's pause right there at well-managed companies what should happen to the difference between voting and non-voting shares they should go towards zero the more badly managed the company so this might be if you want to do some you know a research paper you can take companies like Facebook and look at that boarding to non-boarding share difference over time because clearly people's trust in Zuckerberg has varied over time second it's going to depend on the probability that you can get that change if the voting shareholders have so effectively controlled the model that change can never come that property goes to zero the difference will go towards zero and it'll also depend on how many voting and non-voting shares that are outstanding right if I have a hundred non-voting shares and only one voting share the premium on the voting share is going to be much higher because now I'm taking that expected value of control no there are some Canadian companies with boarding and non-voting these are closely held companies where the owner is three or five shares but those are the only voting shares and there are thousands and thousands of outstanding shares and this comes up in Canadian courts all the time because those voting shares can trade at 50 times the price of the non-voting shares because you're loading up all of that expected value of control into a few shares so if you run into a company voting a non-voting shares you can always use the shortcuts yeah valuing to share I'm going to attach a higher number to the voting shares but if you really want to dig deeper and say why would the voting shares be trading at a premium you got to go through the process of valuing the company with the change put in which brings me to my final point about minority discounts let's say you're valuing a private company you have two values for it 1.6 million with the existing management 2 million with you in place and then I ask you how much will the minority discount at this company be in other words what how much less would you pay if you got 49 of the company you get 51 percent of firm you you're willing to pay up to 51 the optimal value why because you run the firm you can change it to the two main you get 1.02 million you take a 49 stake in the same firm you're going to pay 49 the status core value it's look at that two percent difference in how much it translates into again the better run a private business the smaller the pro the minority discount should be if anybody offers you 49 of the matters of Madison Square Garden no matter Hefty discount because as long as the dolans run it so horrifically run business right same reason if you were offered to be a minority owner of the Mets when the will pawns ran it prepare very low value right so when you think about minority shares and how much you discount them it's going to depend on the perception you have to manage with the company and how much you think they add to the value or take away from the value so expected value of control is not just for you know hostile Acquisitions it shows up all the time I have an extended paper of the value control if you're interested in kind of digging into the property change coming because there are lots of different pieces which brings me to the final point I want to make about the entrance evaluation section when you think about it DCF lots of moving parts right imagine trying to explain your DCF model to a CEO after about the second input is going to lose patience is look I don't have the time for this I have a lot of meetings lined up could you give me one metric and this is a boon for Consultants because over the decades Consultants have taken value which comes from lots of different inputs and said this is the one number that matters let me give you a metric and usually they concoct that metric and it almost always becomes inaccurate I'll give you two acronyms that in the last century hot Consulting companies and was sold by Consulting companies one was this notion called cfroi Cash Flow return and investment you know how we compute return invest Capital right we take operating income departments and capital with the first pushback app it's earnings I'd like a cash flow so cfroi fixes the earnings by replacing with cash flows and second the second thing you worry about with return capital is there's no time value attached which is you don't you wait in earnings you'll make it the future years and current years equally cfroi does it it's like an irr for a company and Holt Associates is chicago-based outfit sold it as the Magic Bullet right if you're a company and you increase your CFR away your value Will Go On and then in the 1990s there was an outfit called Stern Stewart new york-based consulting firm that concocted a measure called economic value added that they said was the greatest measure I'll tell you what economic value add and you tell me whether you think this is a great matter they take the return on Capital same return Capital we talked about they subtract out the cost of capital and here's their first stop they say it's good to have a return in capital higher than the cost account so oh my God that's an incredible answer and then they multiplied by Capital invested why are they trying to do they're saying it's good to make a higher access return on a billion dollars around 10 million dollars but insane insights these are but CEOs lapped it up it was the fastest growing metric in use in companies half the S P 500 at one point in time in the 1990s adopted the sales pitch was this is amazing it'll change the way you think about value in fact they would use words that would drive me crazy you'd get a better valuation of a company who use EBA or cfroi than if you did a discounted cash evaluation it's an absolute lie because all that EBA does what do we do in traditional this kind of cash flow evaluation predict the total free cash for the former discount back at the cost of capital right here's what Eva does it takes that free cash from The Firm it divides it into two pieces one is the portion of free cash flow that gets you to the cost account and then they rest as an excess cash flow it discounts the two separately and it adds the map at the end nature present value is its additive I can divide the cash flows into five pieces that I'm going to get the same value there is in fact I you know you can prove that if you value company the Eva CF Roi and DCF you get exactly the same value but the point is it was sold as this magic bullet all you need to do as a CEO then is to focus on your Eva and everything else will take get taken care of it's a shortcut you know the problem with shortcuts that you're making a lot of implicit assumptions that people are now going to exploit to game the system so here's what I want you to do yep your company's adopted Eva and here's the other things turns to it did there is really clever they tied CEO compensation to higher EBA so increase your EBA you'd get a bonus additional options so let's say you're Eva this year is a half a bit tell me some of the dysfunctional ways you can increase Eva next year that will deliver the bonus for you while making your I know this is you know it's perverse I want you to think about ways in which you can increase Eva that could make your company actually a less valuable company all the time it's just operating income right can I increase my operating income next year by doing some short-term stuff that absolutely Eva encourages basically if I judge you based on Eva I'm encouraging you to go for short-term Investments that pay off as higher operating income in the near term over long-term Investments That might be better for my company does it matter what goes in the invested Capital early on when EBA was computed people did not capitalize leases and include invested capital you know what made your Eva look much better instead of buying an asset you leased it you took it out of the box you're saying but oh you know why are you assuming that every over time if your compensation is tied to bad stuff you will do bad stuff and that's exactly what happened and just to close that discussion of Eva you know the two guys who founded Eva were you know Joel Stone embedded stood and Bennett Stewart could sell refrigerators to Eskimos his Finance knowledge was about as shallow as you can get pretty good he's a great salesperson so I remember being on a panel with their man you know to put a European CEOs at that time he was talking about value announcement he got up and he held up an annual report for Coca-Cola he said Coca-Cola uses Eva in that time remember Coca-Cola was soaring success Coca-Cola is double ditch market cap took in logic classes in school he needs a baby so you want to be like Coca-Cola you should adopt Eda okay I almost you know at that time I was steaming I was you know nothing I could do so next time you know I knew I was going to run into it with some other paddle somewhere in the city I came with my Air Jordans that I'm the first Nike I just released the Air Jordan with Michael Jordan's and I came you know so I came to the panel with with the tennis shoes or basketball shoes so he he made his pitch and after he was done I took my time I took off my shoes I put on the Air Jordans and I said could somebody Point me towards a basketball hoop I've got my hair Jordan's on I ate my Wheaties I remember that Michael Jordan probably had Wheaties that morning as well according to the ads I said I feel like slam dunking the basketball I'd like to tell you something about my leaping a bird it's like six inches off the ground the only basketball hoop I could do a slam dunk under those Fisher Price oops I can wear all of the Air Jordans I would need all the Wheaties I want I will not slam so my point is just because Coca-Cola did not become successful because it adopted Eva Eva is just a metric that basically tracked its success none of these consulting firm build metrics are going to make you more or less value creating value is hard work you're gonna take better projects you've got to fund them better but the shortcuts keep coming at us and they are part of gaming the system so let's talk about pricing your computer remember that four-step process we went through on pricing deconstruct start by defining the multiple make sure your multiple is consistently defined uniformly estimated second describe the multiple look at the histogram look at the data don't use rules of thumb we have the data in front of us analyze the multiplayer with an equity you want to go back to a dividend discount model or an equity valuation model do the algebra and you can tell me what variables drive that multiple if it's an Enterprise Value multiple go back to an Enterprise Value multiple and do this and only then apply the multiple Define describe analyze Supply and I said the problem in pricing is people are in a hurry to do pricing they they want to be sloppy they want to use averages I don't have a problem with pricing but no after your exercises with pricing you can see this is an exercise in data analysis and statistics and using the data better to get a better pricing for your company so let's uh you know let me review now based on the multiple what variables you should be controlling for this is just based on a pure discounted cash flow model you tell me what your multiple is and I said these are the four variables these are the three variants you should focus on price earnings it's growth payout cost of equity EBT sales it's operating margin return on Capital essentially with each one list out the variance those are the variables you want to control for when you look across that model so I asked you to pick a multiple and here's what you picked almost half I mean in in this class half of you picked you see why you keep planning TV to sales what's the nice thing about pricing things relatively sales Jackie there's no negative First is you know if you have money losing company but even for money making companies it turns out that sales is the least accounting contaminated number you can get that statistic that that pie chart if I showed it from 20 years ago you'd have seen about 25 of companies using PE ratios increasingly over time Equity multiples have become a smaller and smaller slice of use and you probably saw that even as you tried out that you ended up at the Enterprise Value models so half Evita sales EB to invested Capital EB debit debt there was one person I think used EB debit p ratio and Price to Book ratios so in terms of equity multiples nine plus eight Seventeen percent of your companies used Equity multiples and my guess is a few of those are back so you had no choice but to use an equity multiple because of the fact there's no such thing as an Enterprise Value or an Enterprise Value model and here's what you found on your pricing relative to your DCF so I took your DCF value and I took your pricing to see what and you're probably not going to give me a surprise right now it's 67 percent of your companies and you know this perhaps is surprising given your overall statistic the DCF value was about 18 percent lower than your pricing on the median I think I got these numbers because it's 40 40 companies the DCF value is higher and 67 the pricing was high as to what that means about the overall Market because remember pricing you're tending to look at what the market is doing and attaching it to your company DCF you're doing an intrinsic valuation and when you looked at what you found your media and Company was overvalued remember the DCF you were overvalued by 10 plus here are the overvaluation is only about three percent in fact I would be surprised if it's not different from zero you see why with pricing on average the typical company is going to be fairly priced because by definition if you're comparing to the rest of the market you're going to move towards the average and the breakdown is almost 50 50. up the companies came out as underpriced half or overpriced you will never I mean my DCF value you can get enough of Statistics like 80 of the companies are under bed with pricing you're almost always going to be around 50 because of the nature of pricing now you see why portfolio managers that price it your job is to pick stocks you need stocks to keep showing up in your portfolio pricing is always going to find you cheap things because it's relative to everything else versus intrinsic valuation you can find yourself completely bereft of companies to invest in because nothing looks cheap you're almost underpriced stocks right so you can see the percentage the most under price is empty and Nigeria thank you I don't even know what the second cup Academy Sports Plus outer is what is what what does it do no I don't know hey and you can work all the way down this you know you see a few big names Game Stop Uber Zillow Alibaba a lot of younger tech companies show us show up as part of that so I I think it depends on what sector but they come out as underpriced relative to whatever sector so maybe your growth is doing amazing things in your pricing because most of these companies don't make much money but remember growth can show up in your pricing equation perhaps push up equation you're almost overpriced stocks it's a person who didn't like the New York Times and the DCF doesn't like it on a pricing as well so it's showing up as overpriced no but you can you can look across to back and you know Philip Morris shows up as overpriced which you know by a huge amount which is surprising given the fact that it's kind of a mature kind of boring company but those are your most overpriced stocks I did ask you to try an option pricing model but what are the two things I said you should look for to see if it works for you one is it has to be money losing don't do this in a money making company others there's a lot of debt this is an option to liquidate that's why for a Growth Company it's kind of pointless even opening this box because the option to liquidate a growth company is going to give you a number much much lower than a DCF valuation so this is reserved for probably mature companies declining companies the question you're asking is you know is there a chance that I could make money if the value kind of bounces back above that outstanding debt and I I know a few of you are wearing casinos I know who is wearing MGM somebody was failing MGM they're having trouble getting the value of the discounted cash flow valuation to be positive why because the business is squeezed they have a lot of debt outstanding the casino business is getting squeezed and they couldn't get the dcfm only where you get the get any number there is to think of MGM as an option where you hope that something good will happen the casino business and perhaps pay off in the previous slide what does it mean this means so you can't get the operating assets greater than the outstanding debt right in fact the other class there are at least 15 companies with the DCF value is negative right but ultimately a negative value doesn't make sense because you don't pay a negative price so the value goes below zero you're basically putting apprehend saying I would pay for the equity in the company the business is just not worth it there's one person in the in the other class who actually spent almost the entire semester trying to get the value for AMC above zero and finally I said at some point you got to just give up right you can try a higher Revenue but basically the question you're asking is is the theater business valuable enough that I can cover the debt and your answer might be no I don't see it so it's entirely rational attaches zero value to a company where there is significant debt outstanding but those are exactly the companies the option pricing model might kick it with AMC what's the optionality do people still go to movie theaters yeah right in fact you could argue that at Disney needs AMC more than AMC needs AMC right because if you take AMC out of the Mix Disney becomes like any other company that got directly to streaming one of the big things about being a movie company is having that outlet so maybe one of those companies might step in and say I'm not I'm surprised it hasn't happened already to be quite honest that an Amazon or in Disney is not snapped up AMC at its current market cap because it could be worth a lot more that's the optionality you're hoping so even though the DCF value is zero because the operating at you're saying there could be this jump in value if somebody else found a different way to run the theater business and there were I think uh eight companies where the option pricing model was used in this class and on average they created a premium of about 41 over your DCF value that's the Allure of optionalities you paid that premium over the DCF so what is the final part of your project I wanted you to tell me whether you'd buy this is why along the way when people said should I run three regressions should I run five my response was do whatever you need to do to make a decision right if you need five regressions to get there run them but this is about converging on that final decision I try to do you buy and buy or sell but a lot of you did go with hold which is kind of chicken but you know it's it's okay I can understand buy sell or hold but when you got to that decision I will wager one of three places one is you say I'm not sure yet you know what you'll never be sure right because the nature evaluation is there's always going to be something over the horizon I constantly hear people saying once this banking crisis is over then maybe I'll buy it back once this crisis in this country is over then maybe I'll buy an Indian store you can't do that you essentially have to accept the fact there's always something that's going you're not going to be sure about and be okay with that uncertainty second you know whether you like it or not when you buy a stock based on evaluation do you believe in market efficiency eventually yes right because how do you make money so we're all believers in market efficiency we just have this very convenient definition of efficient markets that markets are inefficient when we take a big position and then what do they do they come magically efficient and we get a it's a very selective view so when people say I think markets are inefficient and that's why investment markets put them on the sponsor do you think markets are inefficient you just think they're not efficient yet and once you've taken the position they're going to become efficient and finally and I think this is one reason I push back against concentration I'm going to ask you whether you're buying this let's say you have the funds to actually buy and that's an assumption would it make a big difference if you overtaken all of your wealth in buying the stock and putting five percent in it yeah right in fact if you're putting all your wealth you'll almost never put the trigger right it's too much at stake one reason I put this requirement of no investment I ever make will ever exceed five percent of my portfolio to begin with is it actually makes it more likely that I make a decision because otherwise I have too much riding on the decision I'm going to on the one hand the other hand and the third this one I'm buying sitting do I feel sure that I make money not in the least good City go to zero of course will that change my lifestyle not in the least again so to the extent that my bed stays small it allows me to make decisions on companies where otherwise would be paralyzed so the reason you spread your bets is to allow you to make decisions otherwise you're never going to make those bets so I asked you for your recommendation 56 sell 31 by 11 whole what the heck is this moderate buyer what the heck does that even mean plus what is the word moderate in front mean right and so I would take out the moderate and pick one or the other don't do this buy hold you can't do both at the same time right so but this reflects the fact that denying you know you're not this is why analysts can do stuff like this and get away with it right it's not their money it's a strong buy weak buy moderate by take the moderate strong weak you either buy or you sell it if you don't want to do either just hold there is no 15 other choices you can add to the links there are actually two in the same group there is one person who's toxic in that group that you need to be very careful about so you know who's selling this notion let's do things in moderation it sounds like a good thing let's add a moderate no in investing there is nothing moderate about what you're doing you either buy or you sell or you don't do anything just walk away right now just to give you a sense of what this Buy sell I know it's a very tough I want you to focus on this Brown Line it's the most readable though it's a percentage of but so basically it's a buy to sell ratio so when that number is above one there are more bison cells so let's start in Spring of 1999 it's close to one which means there are as many buys and cells spring of 2001 it had shot up to what I think the highest number ever there were one and a half times more buyers than sell so what happens in Spring of 2000 spring of 2001 the.com boom bust and in a sense all of a sudden you start to see more Buys so you can track it over time there's 2008. in fact leading into 2008 the percentage of buys was pretty low then post 2008 pops up again this the last two semesters not both last year and this year the buys to sells have become much lower last year would have been a good leading indicator because it suggested that bad things were coming but you know who knows what this year will break so you can you could track the market over the rest of the year to see how good this statistic is as a collective indicator no point if you you know when you when you look at valuation versus pricing and how do I decide which one is right for me it depends on you know plus what's your value no it depends on the acidity value how marketable it is whether it's a capacity generate cash flows for God's sakes don't waste your time valuing Bitcoin or value of Picasso there's no such thing you can price it right how do you price it because you look at other picassos a Picasso light paintings you see what other people pay for them and you adjust the pricing so don't waste your time trying to Value things that cannot be valued because anything that doesn't have cash flows cannot be valid currencies can't be bad commodities for the most part can only be pressed right so if you ask me what's a fair value for gold I have zero idea but I can tell you how to price code and finally it's going to depend on unique something is if you have a truly unique asset you better hope it has cash flows because pricing it gets really difficult to do on on in terms of what your characteristics are that will determine whether you should value a price if you have a short time Horizon probably should be doing more pricing than valuation you're not you time is not your ally if I gave if I asked you do you have a long time I'll wage if I go around the room you'd all claim to have a long time rise why because that's what we're supposed to say right but this is really not your choice some of it you were born with some of us are naturally more impatient than others some of it is trust upon you you're you know I wonder why I wouldn't have said this at the meeting but how does you know Charlie Munger mentioned this by being concentrated okay time Horizon is not that long why are you 97 years old and you don't have a 20-year time Horizon left so maybe you can concentrate Because by the time Apple falls apart you'll be dead and gone I understand so put the half your money in apple so sometimes time Horizons are driven by things that happen to you you have a healthcare crisis all of a sudden your time Horizon just got shorter right because of all that money coming to you it'll depend on why you're doing the valuation are you doing it to buy the company and hold it for its cash flows they're dying it because doing it because you want to beat the market over the next year and finally it'll depend on what you think about markets how do markets make mistakes they make mistakes that they correct over time which is what intrinsic valuation is built on but they make mistakes in the cross section they're right on average but they're wrong on individual which is what pricing is driven by so if you ask me which is better valuation or pricing I'm going to turn it back on so I'll tell you what works for me based on my beliefs but you got to come up with your own choices on which one you did so this is a question I promised I would ask you at the end of the class I asked you the same question don't remember you can go back and let I think week session two I said at the end of the class I'm going to ask you you know at that time I described it you you hadn't valued a company I haven't priced your company now that you've valued and price your company you don't have to give me the answer I wanted to think about which approach you would use or maybe you'd have concluded after trying to Value advise your company but this is a little Messier and more complex than you thought it was and this isn't for you it's a very healthy recognition when that happens because you know what it's going to lead to right you're going to put your money in index funds going back and live the rest of your life you live perfectly fulfilling life so you never value another company I know I'm not supposed to say that in evaluation class millions billions of people over time have lived fulfilling life without ever having value to company so you can be one of those people because your alternative is that you keep valuing companies and nothing good comes out of it and then you beat yourself up because you've spent all this time value companies and you don't have a reward and as for start of the class I said look you know you're going to build on your skill set and work on your weak side and I talked about storytellers and number crunches so if you were a Storyteller coming into this class I hope I hope I've given you enough comfort with the numbers numbers like Revenue growth and margins and reinvestment you have to naturally go there that you can feel more confident about the story you're telling because once you reinforce your story with numbers the story gets stronger but also you get more discipline you realize when you're telling fairy tale so if you're a Storyteller I hope you've been able to develop that trusted numbers is too strong a word but acceptance of numbers is something you have to talk about in business and if you're a number cruncher and I said this was the tougher task I hope you feel enough confidence in your imagination that you're sometimes willing to let go let go of what we want proofs of everything numbers to back things up sometimes you just got to get take a leap out that say I really don't know what's going to happen I'm going to make an estimate there's nothing that will confirm that my estimate is right yeah but that takes more work and that's why I said it's easier for storytellers to develop than enough comforted numbers to work with valuation than it is for number crunches to let go because you've spent a lifetime getting to where you are right so some very simple propositions about value right every decade I'm told that the world has changed that the old rules don't apply and the more I see things change and the more I see them change back the more I'm convinced that it goes back to basics man when you talk about business it's revenues cash flows growth I mean those things don't change just because you're in a new economy and a new kind of company so go back to basics and if nothing else I hope no that's second I mean in the evaluation take all the places you got stuck and then ask yourself was it worth getting stuck at that place some things you probably spend hours working over that apps I mean for I'll give you an example I know somebody who spent at least a week a seven percent their revenues came from the rest of the world and they wanted to see where in the rest of the world so they spent a lot almost a week doing research in the rest of the world I didn't have the heart to say it but my point was this is a third decimal point estimation issue in your value per share but it takes time to recognize what numbers you should be focusing on what numbers don't matter that sales to Capital that you took hours and hours thinking about if you had a three percent growth rate you know what the sales and capital ratio is making almost no effect on your value why because your revenues are growing so low if your remedies are growing 30 percent it makes far more sense of what's the right sales or capital for your company the reason I did not kind of make it explicit is sometimes you got to work with numbers the point where you say that's the number in this company that I should be focusing on now there's a driveway that would set driver with Netflix to me it's all about content costs that's the number that's going to determine what Netflix is going to be worth a trillion dollars or 100 billion dollars because everything else revolves around you know can they get content costs under control and grow the rate less than the revenues third you know as you go out there you'll be some grisly analyst who's been working 30 years will say you know trust my gut I've been doing this for 30 years six times every day is cheap and this is a business where you could be around 30 years and absolutely have no idea what they're talking about right anecdotal evidence is the worst kind of evidence here and people still use it right they use the example of an individual company when in fact we have the data to counter okay we have hundreds of companies let's let the data let's let the data guide us to keep your perspective it's only evaluation about 15 years ago now in the automatic this class is somebody who's graduating comes up to me and she was a history major from Yale came back to business school and usually if you're a history major from Yale and you come back to business school you take the Strategic route you know what that is take every class with the word strategic now sustainable in its name you can spend two years without ever seeing a number but by accident I think she ended up in this class and she turned out to actually like it she actually was pretty so she can came to me at the end of the class she said I never thought this would happen but I have a job as a sales side Equity researcher I said my condolences now I said my congratulations and she said I'm really scared and I said what are you so scared about she says what if I make a mistake I said be glad you're not a brain surgeon brain surgeon makes a mistake somebody dies on the table right they're an equity research artist you make a mistake what happens somebody gets rich or somebody else gets a little poorer just make sure that somebody's getting a little poorer is not you that's the only requirement think like a Marxist you move some wealth around the world has intended let's Let It Go nothing in valuation is worth losing sleepover I've never lost it's lost sleep for a single night in all of my life because did I get that valuation it's just evaluation it'll work its way through and in investing much as I'd love to tell you that it's killed and whether you understand valuation fundamentals that are going to tell how much money you make I'd be lying you know the dominant factor in investigation it's luck brought home to me by my mother-in-law when she came to visit 22 years ago right at the peak of the dot combo and all she would talk about was what was in her portfolio what was out of her portfolio what she wished was in what and she thought I was interested but I had to act interested so it's silent last year and then she lets it slip that she owed Cisco one of the great stalks of the 90s I was impressed I said Judy why do you pick Cisco I was afraid the answer is I'd like that vegetable oil or I like to dance disco Crisco she said I don't know what they do but no it uh I know they're good luck dominates skill in this process so if I had a party wish we'd be lucky if you're superstitious stay superstitious if you notice your stocks go up if you go into a particular Starbucks and you get a veggie cappuccino my advices go to that Starbucks move next to it if you can you know move Apartments go in there every day buy two venti cappuccinos if need be don't mess with luck because you know it turns against you there goes your portfolio find a point and this is more for me than for you notice this thing called a CFE I actually wrote it 20 years ago I wrote a very different version you want to see the version that I wrote now but there is a CFE you're supposed to fill it out you know I I'm reminding you of doing it because you don't fill your CFE as an MBA what do you not get to see great and when you don't get to see your grades you know what's going to happen you're going to email me so this is about me preempting that process by saying you know just fill in the damn CFE check your grades out so I'm not two weeks from not getting an email saying I can't see my grade could you send it to me I would send it to you even if you did that but take me the trouble okay that's it and I will see you add reminder again the final exam is day after tomorrow so you don't have time to rest after you turn your project then I will see you on Wednesday and the time I think is 1 30 to 3 30 so you know around the time the class ES thank you
